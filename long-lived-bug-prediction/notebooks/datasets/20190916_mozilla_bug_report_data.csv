Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206

The Mozilla Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird mail clients generate an e-mail header
X-Accept-Language: en-us en.

When using the Mozilla application suite the language settings can be changed
using the BROWSER's language options.

When using Mozilla Thunderbird the UI does not allow one to change the language
settings.

Either the language settings should be made a configurable option or the mail
header line X-Accept-Language: en-us en should be omitted. I'm not sure
what's the use of this header line in an e-mail message. I'd prefer it to be
omitted.

Hi

I think this bug will only concerns the french localization of Camino because. In the seach bar (top right corner) theire is a possibility of searching in Le Jargon FR.

Unfortunatly Le Jargon FR have changed its URL. It was http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/ and it moved to http://jargonf.discu.org/ .

In order to allow searchin in the new website the search code sould be changed from:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/general/cherche.php?req=
to
http://jargonf.discu.org/index.php/Special:Search?search=

Fortunatly the new website works with Wikimedia so it should looks like Wikipedia search.

get the DocShell and QI to nsILinkHandler.  Even *better* might be to put the

Using the Back button may cause Mozila to freeze and in other instances to
crash with a stack dump. It does not happen always but quite frequently.

Another problem may have to do something with this problem too. After loading a
picture in a new tab or better several pictures in several tabs I tried to
save these pictures to disk. After I tried to save the second picture Mozilla
crashed with a stack dump. This happens consistantly.

This is a new problem with 1.3B 1.3A was very stable.

My guess is that it has something to do with the interaction between the browser
and the cache.

Build Identifier: Trunk

Add SSE2 optimization for ycc_rgb_convert and turn five dynamic tables into static tables. ycc_rgb_convert is a common color conversion and using SSE2 code instead of scalar code results in about a 25% performance improvement in my testing.

There are four tables that are generated in the jdcolor.c module every time an image is processed. The change here uses a static table instead of going through malloc computation and free each time.

There is a table called range_limit that's created for every image and this is done in jdmaster.c. The change here changes that to a static table instead of creating it for every image.

The SSE2 code and the table code are only varianted on Win32 builds built with MSVC. The SSE2 code will only run on processors that support it but that should be most processors in the last six years.

Investigating this behaviour further it is not sufficient to simply generate a

first cut

Right now thunderbird tends to eat a lot of exceptions. Some make it to the error console most don't.  

There are deep fixes to the platform needed (e.g. Bug 493414) but in the meantime I'd find it really helpful to be able to get useful output on stderr about exceptions events and pretty-printed objects.

I've taken the code that I've used in patches as ddump and made it slightly cleaner.  As per asuth's comments in a patch I'm proposing it as an errUtils module for inclusion in TB.


The basic use case is:

Components.utils.import(resource://gre/modules/errUtils.js)
...

try {
 ... do stuff that might throw an exception
} 
catch (e) {
 logException(e true) // second arg is whether to rethrow
}

which results in the following on the dump output:

-- EXCEPTION START --
+ message (string) 'a is not defined'
+ fileName (string) 'chrome://messenger/content/folderDisplay.js'
+ lineNumber (number) 483
+ stack (string) 428 chars

-- EXCEPTION END --

When viewing the Inbox of a POP3 account if new mail arrives I am unable to
view that new mail.  I can read previously collected email but viewing the
newly received email only displays the currently viewed email. Cannot manage new
email at all (delete read mark as junk etc.).
This behaviour does not occur if viewing a different sub-folder when new mail
arrives.
Changing from Inbox to a different subfolder then back to Inbox does not correc
tthe iussue.
Restarting Thunderbird allows me to view the affected messages but behaviour
recurrs for new messages.
Issue does not occur in build 20040502 and prior.

1.  View a message in Inbox

Incompletely reduced TenFourFox test case (does not fail on Firefox 5 yet)

Per Luke's request in bug 636296 comment 29. To recapitulate I am tracking a TenFourFox bug where the number of arguments in the argsobj is sometimes a ridiculously high number causing malloc() in NewArguments() to fail. The large number after analysis seemed to have come from args.nactual in jsinterpinlines.h. This problem did not occur in Mozilla 2.0 leading me to suspect bug 636296 part 4 because that part reduced the number of situations where that value was updated. Our current wallpaper is this

which does work but seems wrong. Is there blindly a better way?

I have attached the test case that we are using but it does not actually fail on Firefox 5 (it is from TED.com). Unfortunately this test case is not completely minimized (the HTML is but I can only get it to trigger with a specific minified Dojo that I am trying to reduce further). However we don't have mjit in TenFourFox only tracejit so it's possible that this is a situation that tracejit doesn't do right. I'm trying to see if I can make it fail with the supported browser.

If this is not a Firefox bug and it might not be is our putative solution correct? Is there a better way?

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 10.5 en-US rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6

This bug occurs when multiple presentation shells are present in the application such as browser1 containing browser2.  If a drag session is started and the mouse is moved into browser2 dragleave and dragexit events are sent to elements within browser2 as long as the mouse stays in browser2.

If the mouse is moved out of browser2 into the enclosing browser1 dragleave and dragexit events are not sent to elements in browser2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 3.0.6 or Minefield 3.2a1pre 20090305 from a console.
2. Set browser.dom.window.dump.enabled pref to true.
3. Open the test1.xul file from the bug attachment.
4. Select some text and drag it into the test2 box displayed in test1.xul.
5. Drag the text down outside of the test2 box.
6. Drag the text back into the test2 box.
7. Drag the text up out of the test2 box.
Actual Results:  
In step 5 leave2 and exit2 are displayed on the console.  In step 7 they are not.  Also leave2 and exit2 are displayed when entering the test2 box.

Expected Results:  
In step 7 leave2 and exit2 are displayed on the console.

PresShell::HandleEvent must send the drag exit event to the presentation shell containing the previous mouse coordinates.  However it sends all events including drag exit to the presentation shell containing the current mouse coordinates.

The state required to route the event to the proper location is maintained in nsEventStateManager objects.  Each presentation shell has its own nsEventStateManager object.  Thus by sending the drag exit event to the wrong presentation shell the wrong state is used and the event does not get to the proper element.

Interestingly mouseout events do get sent to the proper location.

Due to this bug :-moz-drag-over styling does not work properly and the styling will not be removed in the cases where the dragexit event does not fire properly.  Note that the drag over styling of the boxes will not work at all in Minefield due to bug 481727.",nobody,erik.staats,fixed,1,resolved,4,2019-03-13,0,6,2011-09-29,938,normal,2

Steps to Reproduce:
1. 'Smart Folders'(?) switched off
2. In Local folders select an email with cc line 
3. Click on another account

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U PPC Mac OS X Mach-O en-US rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060108 Firefox/1.6a1

Firefox on OS X does not respond correctly to the AXPress action. This can be verified directly using the Accessibility Inspector from the Apple develop tools to inspect the close button of a Firefox window.

This is a failure of Firefox 1.5 to integrate itself with the OS X accessibility framework. It will break tools that depend on that framework in order to close Firefox windows. For instance it breaks Witch preference pane app which cannot close a firefox window.  It probably also breaks parts of the routine OS X accessibility support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and open a secondary window
2. Start the Apple Accessibility Inspector and inspect (lock on) the window's close button
3. Try to close the window by performing the AXPress action.

Actual Results:  
The window does not close.

Expected Results:  
The window should close.

This bug occurs on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.2 en-US rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060325 Firefox/1.6a1 ID:2006032500 (trunk as of 5h40m ago).

When an extension has contents.rdf files but no chrome.manifest chromereg makes one for it. It does this in parts writing out the conversion of each contents.rdf file separately appending to the manifest file each time. Only there's a bit of a problem with that... the file pointer is at the *start* of the file each time it re-opens it for appending.

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/chrome/src/nsChromeRegistry.cpp&rev=1.346&mark=1559-1560#1549

I've verified that aAppend is true (value 1) but cannot easily verify the location of the file pointer except by observing the resulting changes in the file after each PR_Write.

The result is that each segment is written ontop of the other giving a completely messed up and broken manifest. Given the lack of code changes to the chromereg code in this area I'm going to guess it is an NSPR or XPCOM bug. The Unicode XPCOM I/O bug springs to mind but I've got no evidence either way.

I've set this to major because it looks like a low-level file handling issue which could potentially affect a lot of things and it completely breaks installing extensions in Firefox that have no chrome.manifest (which was exactly the thing I was testing).",nobody,bugzilla-mozilla-20000923,fixed,1,resolved,4,2006-03-27,0,3,2006-03-27,3,major,4

Everytime I view an image by its self a weird background appears.  Here is a picture that I uploaded: http://marc.ca.tt/images/1744615617741.JPG

It's supposed to be a white background not a weird stripped background. How do you change it?  Is this a bug?  Is this a virus which I doubt...

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:0.9.1+)
Gecko/20010611
BuildID:    2001061120

Mozilla crashes if you attempt to read email when your profile is stored on a
file server and mozilla is also running on another machine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a profile on a networked file server (samba is best as you can see the
oplocaks and break the client)
2. Start Mozilla on one machine and read some email (S-IMAP in this case) it is
best if you have lots of folders/subfolders
3. Go to antother machine and start to read email there (mozilla -mail)
4. Crash

Actual Results:  Crash

Expected Results:  Mozilla should notice the oplocks and request a break or
whatever or fail gracefully

See Talckback IDs TB31658687M  TB31658655G

If you use samba 2.0.x as your file server and you kill the first clients
connection (and oplocks) you can restart mozilla on the second machine without
any problems.

Only tested with Samba as a file server.

oplocks with one mozilla looks like the following

If I click the download button on the offline tab of the folder properties dialog it does nothing. Fix upcoming.

The fix is to restore some of the code that the auto sync landing removed. This code is only hit when nsImapMailFolder::DownloadAllForOffline is called which is from the folder properties dialog and the file | offline download and sync now.

1) chameleon is technically a development box.  The hardware isn't quite up to our production standards (lack of redundancy etc).  lists.spreadfirefox.com wound up running on it one of those times a long time ago when SpreadFirefox got hacked and it was the quickest place to move it at the time to get it up and running again the most quickly.  It was only supposed to be a temporary move and it never got moved elsewhere.  lists.spreadfirefox.com is the only production service running on this box.

2) We get a lot of spam on the abuse/postmaster/webmaster addresses on the spreadfirefox-related domain names because chameleon doesn't have very good spam filtering set up.  By moving these domains into the San Jose colo we can put them behind our primary mail relays which have very beefed up and actively-maintained spam and virus protection.

I don't know if there are any mailing lists on lists.spreadfirefox.com which are actively used so I'll need input from SpreadFirefox folks as to whether this needs to have a major outage window scheduled and announcements made or if I can just do it (mail will be queued and eventually deliver you'll basically just lose the Mailman web interface for the duration of the move).",justdave,justdave,fixed,1,resolved,4,2015-03-12,0,6,2007-10-05,25,normal,2

I noticed that Firebird supports on-the-fly XSLT transformations of XML
documents using the xml-stylesheet PI. That's good but you ought to change the
MIME type. There is no MIME type text/xsl! The right one is application/xslt+xml
according to RFC 3023:

  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt

So if you have an XML document and wants to make it transform on-the-fly while
loading in Firebird you should have this PI before the root element:

CORE-76209,2001-04-16,CSS Parsing and Computation,CORE,Style context caches removes elements from the middle of an array,"Another fallout of profiling the colour table stress case (the style people must 
begin to hate me. :-) ) is that there is a nsVoidArray that is emptied one 
element at a time which causes alot of memmoves which degrades performance when 
pulling down a big style system.

If I understand it correctly StyleContextImpl's destructor 
calls StyleSetImpl::RemoveStyleContext which removes the style from a cache with 
the following code.

  nsVoidArray *pResults = nsnull
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(GetContexts(aKey&pResults)) && pResults) {
     PRUint32 nCountBefore = Count()
     if (nCountBefore > 0){
       if(pResults->RemoveElement(aContext)) {
...

RemoveElement is slow since it requires moving at average half the array in 
memory. When done with all elements we get a nice O(n^2) algorithm.

0.5 seconds when leaving the colour table stress case.",pierre,bratell,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-08-15,0,3,2001-08-15,121,minor,2

15.1.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers

   Accept request-headers can reveal information about the user to all
   servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header in particular
   can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private
   nature because the understanding of particular languages is often
   strongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.

   An approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent
   to omit the sending of Accept-Language headers by default and to ask
   the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language headers to a
   server if it detects by looking for any Vary response-header fields
   generated by the server that such sending could improve the quality
   of service.

   Elaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request
   in particular if these include quality values can be used by servers
   as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user
   identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking
   and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server
   click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for
   many users not behind a proxy the network address of the host
   running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user
   identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance
   privacy user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept
   header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy
   measure proxies could filter the accept headers in relayed requests.
   General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header
   configurability SHOULD warn users about the loss of privacy which can
   be involved.

hi norris

the following was reported by our QA dept:

(just so you know we do not use the optimizer.)

---------------------------------- 8<--------------
Test case for a JavaScript Bug:

The JS engine failed with the following piece of code:

    alert(inside js file)
    var anArray = new Array()
    var pos = 1
    anArray[0] = 5
    anArray[1] = 6

    ++anArray[--pos]
    alert(anArray[pos])

The above script works fine within netscape but it throws the following
exception with our browser which uses rhino:

java.lang.NullPointerException

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U PPC Mac OS X Mach-O en-US rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050513 Firefox/1.0+

Modal dialogs spawned either by Firefox itself (such as SSL warnings) or by
JavaScript in web pages calling window.alert() are resizable by grabbing the
grippy (in Mac OS X) or the window edges (in Windows) and dragging.  These types
of dialog boxes should not be resizable but they are when
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable is set to true.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set security.warn_entering_secure to true
2. Set dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable to true
3. Open a new tab and go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org
4. Grab the bottom right corner of the security warning and attempt to resize it

Actual Results:  
The dialog box is able to be resized allowing you to make it really big or so
small that the OK button is no longer visible.

Expected Results:  
The dialog box should not be resizable regardless of the value of
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable.

I verified this bug in both Firefox and Seamonkey (both Classic and Modern) on
the trunk and the latest release versions (1.0.4 and 1.7.8 respectively) on
both Mac OS X and Windows.  This bug is more obvious on Mac OS X since it places
a grippy on the bottom right corner.  The dialogs are only resizable when
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable is set to true when it is false they
behave as they should.

The above steps reproduce this bug using a dialog box spawned by Firefox.  I
will attach a testcase which uses a JavaScript alert() windnow.

The function goToLine of the viewSource.js can not go to the last
line.

I was trying to use this function for writting a new browser extension.
But I am not able to jump to the last line of a file:

The reason is because of this code:

         if (curLine == line && !(range in result)) {
 -  489           result.range = document.createRange()
 -  490           result.range.setStart(textNode curPos)
    491 
    492           //
    493           // This will always be overridden later except when we look for
    494           // the very last line in the file (this is the only line that does
    495           // not end with \n).
    496           //
 -  497           result.range.setEndAfter(pre.lastChild)
    498 
 -  499         } else if (curLine == line + 1) {
 -  500           result.range.setEnd(textNode curPos - 1)
 -  501           found = true
 -  502           break
    503         }

Line 499 there is a condition with curLine=line+1
Unhappily if you try to go to the last line there is no line +1 and it does
not work.

I guess this might be related to bug 397596 no idea.
But since this has a different regression range I'm filing this as a new bug.

See testcase which crashes current trunk build (after hanging for a short while).

Build Identifier:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20090220 SeaMonkey/2.0b1pre

Since closed tabs in SeaMonkey are tied to the browser history if the user uses the Tools->Clear Private Data... menu and then clears the Browsing History SeaMonkey needs to clear the stored closed tabs.  Otherwise if the user uses the Undo Close Tab tab bar content menu entry a blank tab is opened that cannot be closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close one or more tabs
2. Click the Tools->Clear Private Data... menu item.
3. In the window that opens check the Browsing History and click Clear Private Data Now
4. Right click tab bar and select Undo Close Tab

Actual Results:  

A blank tab opens.  This tab cannot be closed.

Expected Results:  

The Undo Close Tab open should be grayed out as there should not be any closed tabs to restore.

For en-US we're currently shipping with GMail and Yahoo! Mail for mailto: and 30boxes for webcal: urls and we're on a ongoing evangelism effort to add more. We're going to add support for irc links to mibbit.com soon. For Kazakh we'd like to do that too.

Following that is a reach out by the evangelism team to try to get the vendor to support protocol handlers.

A few months ago the Netlock Class QA root certificate was submitted to add it to the certificate repository.

But there was some change in hungarian regulations and we should switch because these to the other root CA certificate profile (there was some predefined root CA certificate profile) to follow these regulations.

So the actually used root CA certificate has different extension follwing the regulations and we would like to ask you to change it.

(previous request is here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279728 )
(maybe open bugs are closable regarding our previous request because the extensions which cause bugs are not critical now.)
(this problem was reported to the RFC maintainer qcStatement should be not critical)

The new Netlock Class QA certificate is the following.
(Purposes are the same.)

The url shows what I mean and this only happens while I'm resizing an element or more specificly a div with a rounded border. The radius is being applied in a seperate css file and it's set to 20px. I have the most recent nightly build as would be indicated by the build identifier. I'm using an 8800gtx and q6600 so I can't see it being an issue of not being able to render fast enough.

If I'm mistaken on my methods of applying a rounded border expecting it to render fine while being re sized than I apologize.

To give perspective trying the same effect in safari it cheats and turns the border into a sharp edged border before finishing the rendering and turning it back into a rounded border and it is completely smooth however not exactly what I expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a div and give it a border using -moz-border-radius: 20px
2.resize the div using timers (in order to see it clearly one second for each 200 px)
Actual Results:  
I see what is shown by the link I included under the URL field.

Expected Results:  
a straight outer border and clean rounded corners.

This is my first time reporting a bug for anything however although I'm a noob at bug reporting I'm an open-minded comp. sci. student so if you need more info just tell me and I'll do my best to provide it.

It expands by a few hundred megabytes every reload of test_seek.html. If you wait long enough (I assume) a garbage collection is done and the memory shrinks back down to a few hundred megabytes. When running this many times it's easy to expand the memory usage to over a gigabyte.

Usually the first run expands the memory usage to a few hundred magabytes but if I add a call to gc() at the end of _connectionClosed in httpd.js:719 memory always stays at around 9MB.

Note that test_seek is disabled on Windows because as it fails intermittently. This is because either necko or httpd.js can't handle suspending or resuming connections this is a separate issue and I'm looking into this. If test_seek.html appears to not terminate that's not related to this gc issue. If I set the media code to not try to suspend/resume connections this memory bloat still happens so that's not the cause.

This bug happens on at least Linux and Windows. You have to edit content/media/test/Makefile.in to enable test_seek.html on Windows if you want to test on Windows.

1. Run mochitest on content/media/test_seek.html

a button and an input field i.e. Reply-To: -> kd-moz@tprac.de ->

If on a web page there is a link with a URL which ends in a %-encoded character (but does not have any other escaped characters in the URL) and the page is displayed in UTF-8 the escaped character does not display in the status bar.

This doesn't affect functionality. If such a link is clicked Firefox will open the correctly escaped URL.

Everything works normally if either of the following is true:
* There are other escaped characters in the URL
* The page is displayed in any other encoding than UTF-8

The following may be true but none are necessary for reproducability:
* The page is actually encoded in UTF-8
* The server specifies UTF-8 in its headers
* UTF-8 is indicated in the HEAD block of the HTML file

For examples see the testcase HTML file.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML file that contains a link to an address which ends in an escaped character.
2. Open the file in Firefox.
3. Make sure that Firefox displays the file in UTF-8 by selecting it in the Character Encoding menu.
4. Hover over the link and look at the status bar.

173051 comment 23.

I think we should round CSS border widths to the nearest device pixel in the
style system so that a given border width always rounds to the same size.  The
idea here is that we're solving this problem only for borders and not for
anything else -- since:
 1) for things like widths we want to ensure that 4 * 25% is 100% not a few
pixels less and
 2) we don't want consistency of heights for things handled by (1) since that
creates gaps like in bug 173051.

roc points out that we should be rounding to device pixels not CSS pixels.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Win98 en-US rv:0.9.2) Gecko/20010628
BuildID:    2001062815

I found this on an IBM download page and created the reduced test case at:

   http://www.ksu.edu/test/mozilla/left-right.html

The problem is that the layout changes when the HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes of
the IMG tag are used even when the height and width specified exactly match the
natural size of the image.  See the test case for more description.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  View test case


There are three bugs described in the test case.  The first two I presume are
really manifestations of the same problem just differing in the horizontal and
vertical dimensions.

The third problem I discovered while generating the test case but is likely
independent so I'll file a separate bug on it.

Also quirks mode is involved.  The test case has no DOCTYPE and thus Mozilla
formats it in quirks mode.  However I don't think that the layout anomolies are
intentional.  

A duplicate of the test case file with a DOCTYPE to put Mozilla into standard
mode is at:

   http://www.ksu.edu/test/mozilla/left-right-standardmode.html

Standard mode uses a different height for the rows in the first table but I
think this is intentional.  It makes it difficult to tell if there is an extra
vertical pixel or two.  The second table doesn't have additional height and
does show the extra vertical and horizontal space.

Also note that NS 4.77 IE 5.0 *and Netscape 6.0* do not show these anomolies.",karnaze,neil,fixed,1,resolved,4,2002-09-21,0,10,2002-09-20,445,normal,2

In an attempt to clean up the talos configuration world I've come up with this:

- entirely get rid of config.py
- move everything into sample.config
- normalize all paths in sample.config to be workable across platforms (ie a path of 'pageloader/chrome' will be correctly interpreted as 'pageloader\chrome' on windows)
- to handle the different counter options under different platforms created win_counters and unix_counters which are correctly used depending on the system
- add a --debug option and get that out of the config file

So as long as things are installed in the 'standard' locations you should be able to run talos across win/mac/linux using the same sample.config.

But I also wanted to add some management UI to allow the user to see what preferences they had set and delete/modify them if they don't want them stored any more. There's no API to do anything like this so I had to use cps.DBConnection to query the DB directly.

A secondary issue is that the hostname retrieved from the DB this way is not a proper URL (just www.host.com) but all the nsICPS interfaces require a nsIURI to modify or delete the pref.

However I observe that GCC's STL (which is what we get on OSX and Linux) can be relied on to call std::terminate rather than crashing in an unpredictable way when it wants to throw an exception but it's been called from code compiled with -fno-exceptions.  Thus if we are confident that all C++ implementations we care about have this behavior (i.e. we need to check MSVC++'s behavior with /EH-) and we are comfortable treating all STL exceptions as fatal we don't need the wrappers.

Based on a quick skim of C++98 I think these are the exceptions that STL containers and strings can throw:

 bad_alloc   -- malloc failure if we're ok with all STL container usage being
                abort-on-memory-exhaustion this is fine
 length_error
 overflow
 invalid_argument -- various conditions amounting to assertion failures e.g.
                     you cannot possibly allocate an object of size 2**68.
                     Should be safe to treat as always-fatal.
 out_of_range -- Checked container accessors throw this when the index is
                 out of range for the container.  Should be safe to treat as
                 always-fatal

tables checking that they do end up creating a cell around the new float also
wrapping any other non-tabular elements at that point.)",layout.floats,ian,fixed,1,resolved,4,2003-09-16,0,2,2003-09-16,101,normal,2

FIREFOX-349054,2006-08-17,Disability Access,FIREFOX,Visual Focus when tabbing out of Web Forgery popup,"Test environment:
   Windows XP Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060815

Description:

On the Suspected Web Forgery popup if you tab out of the warning pop-up window visual focus is completely lost.  This happens when tabbing through the links on the grayed-out web page behind the security warning popup.


Steps to recreate:

1. Make sure the Google anti-phishing security option is set in the Firefox
security options.
    a. Open Firefox Tools Options and open Security page.
    b. Select Tell me if the site I'm using is a suspected forgery checkbox
    c. Select Check by asking [Google] about each site I visit radio button.
2. Open this web page URL in Firefox browser: 
http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html

- This results in the display of the Suspected Web Forgery pop-up.

3. Keep pressing the Tab key several times.  Focus moves to 
- the Get me out of here! button 
- then the Ignore this warning button 
- then the Send report button 
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Location field 
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Search field  
- then... where?  (no obvious visual focus showing anywhere)
- ... keep pressing Tab and eventually program focus returns to the Suspected
Web Forgery popup window links.

- It appears the program focus is tabbing through the links on the grayed-out
web page displayed behind the Suspected Web Forgery popup window.  None of
those focus changes can be seen visually.

Expected results:

1. The visual focus should be clear at all times. even when tabbing through the grayed-out page behind the security warning.  

Often items that are grayed out are not accessible through the keyboard. In this case the user should not be allowed to tab to items in the grayed-out page before a selection is made on the anti-phishing warning popup.",tony,deangelo,fixed,1,resolved,4,2019-05-03,0,8,2007-11-15,455,normal,2

CORE-300030,2005-07-07,Layout,CORE,Refactor intrinsic width computation out of nsIFrame::Reflow,"This bug describes a design change that I've been talking about for a
while (see various posts to mozilla-layout).  Many bugs likely to be
fixed by this change have [reflow-refactor] in the Status Whiteboard.
I've been working on the changes on various REFLOW_{YYYYMMDD}_BRANCH
branches.

The basic idea to make two closely related changes at the same time:
 1. Change intrinsic width computation so that it happens in separate
    methods on nsIFrame.  (Currently preferred with calculation using
    the nsIFrame API can happen in two different ways as well:  having
    only one codepath reduces incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.)
 2. Change the way we handle incremental layout to use dirty bits on the
    frames rather than the reflow tree (which is essentially out-of-line
    dirty bits) and a complicated system of reflow reasons that often
    leads to weird incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.

I hope to add more details of the new design here in the near future.
Much of it is still open to change at this point the branch is close to
compiling and probably a ways from working so the cost of changing
things is still relatively low.",dbaron,dbaron,fixed,1,resolved,4,2019-07-11,12,9,2006-12-07,518,major,4

If a call is propagated down to nsDocShell::GetDocument via the embedding apis
(like nsIWebNavigation::GetDocument()) and no document is loaded yet nsDocShell
creates an about:blank document.  Is this proper behavior for what appears to
be an accessor function?  Rather than change the state of the object shouldn't
it just return null if no document exists?

doesn't make sense to serve the transformation file because the transformation
is not an alternate version of the document. It does not make sense to serve the

rendered in a useful way by a user agent that does not have a priori knowledge

CORE-67233,2001-01-31,Widget: Win32,CORE,Inconsistently applying keyCode/charCodes,"While reviewing the charCode and keyCode property of the event object I have
noticed that the values are inconsistantly applied.  A good example is (assuming
 ^ represents the control key) ^c returns a charCode of 99 (the c
character) but ^[ returns a keyCode of 27 (escape character).  If alpha
characters used in combination with the control key return the alpha character
then the symbolic characters in combination with the control key should return
the symbolic character!

I think that control + key combination should ALWAYS return the keycode in order
to separate them from the normal pressing of a key.  This may also be true of
the alt key but not as importantly as the character key since the control + key
combinations have pre-defined meanings in ASCII.

In a way I think it might be best if a keyCode is always provided and a
charCode only provided when a displayable key has been pressed.

The site www.snakenetmetalradio.com uses some sort of sesion management that
relies on cookies. If you're not logged in any attempt to access an internal
page redirects you to the login page. If cookies are enabled one is logged in
automatically. This worked up to Mozilla 0.9.9

Now with release candidate 1 I can go to the login page and get logged in
automatically because of activated cookies. The default page after login is
http://www.snakenetmetalradio.com/heavymetallounge/

But then all links (whether clicked or typed in the URL bar doesn't matter) end
in a redirect to the login page where I'm successfully logged in and end up
redirected at http://www.snakenetmetalradio.com/heavymetallounge/ again.

That said maybe we should actually keep track of the first submits in both
mInElements and mNotInElements?  With the current setup I worry that a single
submit followed by a bunch of image inputs will make life unhappy.  For
example we could store the indices in both rather than the element pointers. 
We'd need to maintain the indices a little on insertion and removal and change
GetDefaultSubmitElement to compare the two indices and return the right
thing... but then in this code we could simply do an index compare and be done
with it.

To summarize instead of tracking the default submit element we would track the index of the first submit element in the in-elements list and the first submit element in the not-in-elements list. The default submit element could be quickly determined from these. This would speed up parsing certain forms.

I'll come up with a testcase for this.",bzbarsky,jlurz24,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,11,2007-08-06,324,normal,2

TOOLKIT-517133,2009-09-16,Crash Reporting,TOOLKIT,Get crash stats for X errors,"Often enough we get reports of X errors.  It would be nice to get some stats
to indicate which of these are causing frequent problems.  Currently GDK's
X error handler prints some helpful data to standard error and exits with
status 1.

We could get a first indication of where these errors are occurring using
XSetErrorHandler in nsAppRunner to set up a handler that calls abort() instead
of exit() after printing similar data.  Using abort would also often be more
helpful than exit even in non-crashreporter-enabled builds to make getting a
stack easier.

Eventually it would be even better to be able to report the error code and
request type code.  (These are asynchronous errors but enough X operations
require round trips that it is usually not too long before the error is
detected.)  This doesn't seem to be to different from CRT invalid parameter
handler reports (see bug 397199) so maybe something similar could be used.
Bug 510505 also looks like it would provide a way to do this.

Some might argue that we should attempt to continue from X Errors (bug 348463
and bug 210931).  I'm not sure how well this would work as GTK (and Mozilla)
are probably not expecting to continue after errors.  If we do try to continue
in release builds we should still catch these errors in debug builds.

When a (form) element is focussed in a tab but scrolled out of view and you
switch to another tab and back the focussed element is scrolled back into view.

steps to reproduce: 

1 open a random bugzilla bug page like bug 120148

3 scroll down to get the textfield out of view
4 remember how far you scrolled down
5 switch to another tab (or create a new one)

When you choose to restore bookmarks from a bookmarks backup it displays and lets you to select only files that have a particular extension html.

You should be able to choose to display and select files that are not html. Although naming the files *.html is the normal way and a good default to have why shouldn't you be able to name your backups however you'd like?

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Library via Organize Bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu
2.From Import and Backup choose Restore --> Choose file.
3.A dialogue pops up and it (sensibly) displays files with the suffix .html in selected directories
4.There is a box that allows you to choose what types of file are shown but it less sensibly allows only one choice html.
Actual Results:  
You can't choose your bookmarks backup if it is not named *.html

If Automatically check for updates to: is enabled for Deer Parc (Firefox)
and Installed Extensions and Themes you get a notification if updates to Deer
Parc are found but you DONT get notified for any update found for an Extension. 
The only way to see if there is an Extension-update available is to manually
open the EM scroll through all the Extensions and look out for the Update Now
Button behind each Extension.
Since Extension-updates will never be applied automatically and most
unexperienced Users will not look regularly into EM auto-check gets pretty
useless and most Users will be stuck with old Extensions.
This could be an potential security-risk with old unsafe Extensions (aka
Greasemonkey) not beeing updated. Therefore setting Severity to Major (and a
major feature is broken afterall). Please notice me if this should be lowered to
normal. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you have Automatically check for updates to: enabled for Extensions
2. Install some old Extensions for which an Update is available and the
update-check works. (I took MR_Tech_About-About_1.1.1 linkification_0.10.0 and
flashgot-0.5.9.5) You may have to raise em:maxVersion to 1.4 in install.rdf with
latest Nightlies.
3. Set extensions.update.interval to something as low as 180 if you dont want to
wait 24h.
4. Restart Browser browse normally and watch for any notification. I had to
wait approx. 10 minutes propbably because of app.update.timer 600000. 

Actual Results:  
There were no visible notification sign etc. of any (Extension)-Update found
no Update was downloaded or installed. The only way to see if the auto-check was
sucessful was to watch for the Update Now Buttons in EM.  

Expected Results:

it should be installed (just like Application-Updates) maybe even respect the

I'm glad it's not just me.  I've been seeing this for two or three days
but I've had enough other problems that I wasn't sure if it was a generic
issue.

The first page loads fine but when it's about time for the refresh the
browser crashes.  This happens for both a debug and an optimized build.

The crash does not cause a core dump so I can't get a backtrace.  My gdb
is also acting up (it's complaining about a ptrace failure when the first
thread splits off) so I can't run it under a debugger either.

I'm running MkLinux (a PPC-based Linux implementation) on a Mac 8500/150.

more from chofmann:
On todays linux release build this is what I see after
trying to load a url or two.

In certain bindings (colorpicker preferences) the function's body is wrapped in
a try..catch block to make sure that an error/exception in the on*** handler
doesn't cause the fireEvent's caller to halt.

The problem is in the catch clause the exception is dump()-ed to console but
not to the JS Console. Many XUL developers use the JS Console for
troubleshooting and it's confusing to them that some of  errors in their code

's oncommand reports the error while 's onpaneload does not.)

The solution is to report the error using Components.reportError(e) instead of
(or in addition to) dump(e). This will report the errors to the JS Console
albeit with wrong location info.

FIREFOX-420556,2008-03-02,Theme,FIREFOX,sidebarheader on GNOME has a transparent background,"Created attachment 306847
patch v1: fixes problem

The sidebar header on GNOME has a transparent background because its -moz-appearance: toolbox rule overrides its background-color: -moz-Dialog rule which causes problems for theming engines like Personas that expect the header to have an explicit background color as it does on Mac and Windows.

The -moz-appearance rule also overrides rules specifying top and bottom borders and it's unclear why there are these contradictory rules but the rules are the same as in winstripe where -moz-appearance does not override the other rules so perhaps they were simply copied from Windows to Linux verbatim.

In that case the intent would have been for the header to have the specified background color -moz-Dialog which we can do by simply removing the -moz-appearance.  Nevertheless that also causes the explicit border rules to be applied and I looked at three other GNOME apps with sidebars (Totem gThumb and Evolution) and none of them give their sidebar headers borders (although Evolution gives it a different background color).

Plus borders look funky with the native GTK splitter which is borderless.  So I think the header should remain borderless while fixing the background color issue which we can do by removing both the -moz-appearance rule and the top and bottom border rules.

Here's a patch that does that.

Note: there are other things I noticed while investigating this issue like that we use a widget (sidebarheader) with no XBL binding that we put its styles in toolkit/ instead of browser/ on Linux and Windows (it's in browser/ on Mac although there's at least one funky rule there as well) and that we pad the header label by four pixels on the left which causes it to be misaligned with text in the sidebar itself (f.e. the Search label in the Bookmarks sidebar).

But I'll file those as separate bugs.

Sure --- I've promised strict mode and breakpad CFI at the moment but once those are in the clear this would be satisfying to do.  But it's filed as a bug now so anyone with gumption should grab it.

---

The bigger cleanup I kept refraining from doing in the upvar2 work to keep the
patch only insanely big instead of super-insanely big is to get rid of almost
all the parameters to jsparse.cpp functions making most of them methods of
JSCompiler. This should speed up the recursive-descent parser.

Beyond this there are some cleanups to jsscan.h to use C++ canonical style. But
again the JSCompiler wants at least some inline helpers to forward calls on
itself to its tokenStream member to save typing and shorten lines full of
redundancy in jsparse.cpp.

---

To say a bit more all the C static functions that have the JSParser signature:

typedef JSParseNode *
JSParser(JSContext *cx JSTokenStream *ts JSTreeContext *tc)

become JSCompiler methods taking zero args. Any cx uses become free and need to
rename to context -- or better we rename JSCompiler::context -> cx. Similarly
for ts -> &tokenStream mutatis mutandis. The tc param needs to be a top of
tree context stack pointer in JSCompiler but that's easy to do too.

Hope this helps and actually wins. Zero params has to make a difference on
code perf as well as size even if we sometimes load this->cx or whatever. But
a second opinion is welcome.",david.herman,jimb,fixed,1,resolved,4,2010-04-07,0,22,2010-04-07,198,normal,2

When editing rich text in Gmail and typing characters with accents (such as á or ü) on keyboards that require two keystrokes to do so (such as Dutch or U.S.) typing the accent mark starts find-as-you-type. This is really annoying as it can cause you to overwrite text you've just written (since find-as-you-type selects it) or make the text editing field lose focus (depending on the circumstances).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in at https://mail.google.com/mail/
2. Click Compose Mail.
3. Make sure you are in rich formatting mode (click Rich formatting if necessary).
4. Move focus to the text editing field for the body of the message (the field below the Subject: field).
5. Type the accent mark ´ (option-E on Dutch or U.S. keyboard on other keyboards such as Finnish there is a separate key for this usually somewhere on the right use Keyboard Viewer to figure it out).
6. Type the character a.
Actual Results:  
After step 5 a ´ appears in the status bar but note that there's no message indicating that find-as-you-type has started.

The handling of calls in lirasm is currently screwy.  In particular we
infer the CallInfo details of a function entirely from the call site.  But
we currently get the arg types wrong in some cases on X64.  This patch fixes
this. 

Furthermore for built-in functions inferring isn't a good idea we should
check the call site details against the existing CallInfo details instead.
So the patch does that as well.  This will catch some asm code errors.

Also calling blocks by their address (eg. call 0x1234 fastcall) seems 
like a terrible idea and isn't currently used AFAICT.  So I removed this
functionality.

While the same call atob() from a DOM Window throws an exception if the context is a JS component the code exits with *no exception thrown* and *no crash*. It apparently just stop executing making error handling or predictable execution impossible.

Should further analysis show this can happen with other JS APIs JavaScript components should be considered very unreliable all at once.
This may also have security implications.

Notice that this happens on Gecko 1.9 and above only. Firefox 2 behaves as expected throwing an exception no matter if the global object is a DOM Window or not.

Step to reproduce:

1. Install the AdBlock Plus extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

3. Evaluate the following code line:

The browser goes compute bound and also hangs the unix window manager when
attemping to load a page using a dropdown menu (QA or Bookmarks).  I have not
tried typing in a URL to see if only the dropdown menus are the problem. 
This started happening today using a trunk build pulled 20040112.
This build of the browser is unuseable.
The 20040110 trunk build works fine.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start browser
2a. select QA/CVS Checkins today or
2b. select any bookmark item
3. browser/window manager is now compute bound/hung

Actual Results:  
The menu dropdowns stay open the browser is compute bound
the window manager is hung and the selected URL never starts to load.


Expected Results:  
The dropdown menus should have closed and the URL load should have started.",events,jim.brown,fixed,1,resolved,4,2004-01-12,0,8,2004-01-12,0,critical,5

It seems to me the behaviour of the accept cookie dialog has changed with 3.0.5 to be non-modal. Maybe this is related to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405239

Now it sometimes happens (a matter of bad timing) that I click on the webpage which causes the accept cookie dialog being opened behind the ff window. It then looks like the web page isn't loaded because ff waits for confirmation of that dialog.

Is there a way to make that dialog modal so that it is never opened behind the window?

I use ff 3.0.5 on win xp/sp3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Accept cookie to Ask every time
2.Open a few pages that demand setting cookies
3.Click in the main window while the pages are loading
Actual Results:  
The Accept Cookie dialog is opened in the background. If you don't look carefully it looks as if ff would hang and wouldn't load the page.

Expected Results:  
The confirmation dialog should always be in the foreground. I think it would be best to embed it in the window like the allow-popup dialog.

CORE-527147,2009-11-06,JavaScript Engine,CORE,flat lambdas' parents differ between recording and trace,"In the following code:

function g() {
    var x = 1
    var result = abcd.replace('b' function(){return x})
}
for (var i = 0 i < 100 ++i) {
    g()
}

The parent of |function(){return x}| differs between when we are interpreting/recording and executing on trace.  This can be observed by putting a breakpoint in jsstr.cpp FindReplaceLength on the line:

        *sp++ = OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(OBJ_GET_PARENT(cx lambda))

For the first three executions the parent is the global object for the fourth (on trace) the parent's class is a js_FunctionClass.  This causes a problem for tracing String.replace with a lambda since the trace type of a function differs from other objects.

The root of the discrepancy is in TraceRecorder::record_JSOP_LAMBDA_FC which effectively passes cx->fp->argv[-2] (the caller object) to js_AllocFlatClosure as the parent.  In the interpreter cx->fp->scopeChain is passed which is the global object for the above code.

I read that scopeChain can be lazily initialized so perhaps in some situations the caller object would in fact be the parent of a new lambda.  Is this possible?  If so then the generated code would be technically correct.

Even if this behavior is allowed though it would be nice (for avoiding an always-wasted recording) if the trace type of a function's parent did not change from record-time to trace execution-time.

Any hCalendar microformat with the location element causes the Add to Google Calendar action to be non-functional (i.e. nothing happens when clicking). Additional details and examples can be found at the URL I submitted with this report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid hCalendar microformat minus the location element
2. Test with Events > Add to Google Calendar (will work)
3. Add a simple location e.g. Conference Room to the same sample hCalendar microformat
3. Test again with Events > Add to Google Calendar (will not work)
Actual Results:  
As indicated the hCalendar without the location element will be populated nicely into Google Calendar's Add Event form once a location element is added Events > Add to Google Calendar does not respond for that event.

Expected Results:  
The value of the location element should be added to the Google Calendar query string and populated into the Add Event form accordingly. Again on the URL submitted with this bug I have a sample Google Calendar event URL that has a simple location added in the Query string.

CORE-292890,2005-05-04,Document Navigation,CORE,Investigate interaction of bfcache/fastback and midas,"At least two possible issues here:

First the editing session is torn down on progress listener notifications and
fastback doesn't restore it.  

So with fastback if a site sets designMode on a document in a frame then the
frame is navigated to another URL and then the user goes back we will have:

1)  No editor hooked up in the frame.
2)  The document thinking an editor is hooked up.

At this point there is no way to reenable designMode for that document due to
item 2 even if the site uses the DOMPageRestore event to do so.

Second editing session teardown messes with things like image animation modes
script enabling etc etc on the document we're leaving.  If fastback also
messes with them we need to ensure the two run in the right order.

Simplest solution (and possibly most correct) may be to disable presentation
caching for HTML documents that have mEditingIsOn testing true.",bryner,bzbarsky,fixed,1,resolved,4,2006-03-12,1,7,2005-07-19,76,normal,2

Hello all I've come to a strange behaviour with Firefox (3.0.1) and
pyatspi. Atspi's insertText() works normally on textareas but seems
to only work on textboxes ()  when they're not
empty.

Can anyone confirm this behaviour and suggest a workaround ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a webpage with a texbox (google yahoo or better more simpler
non-javascript-enabled websites)
2. open Accerciser and inspect the textbox (focus the textbox in the
browser and click ctrl+alt+a)
3. make sure the textbox doesn't contain text. if it does delete the text at hand.
4. in the accerciser control type: acc.queryEditableText().insertText(0'xxx'3)
Actual Results:  
nothing.

Expected Results:  
textbox gets populated with 'xxx'

After trying to edit an event I'm stuck with some windows about confirming your attendance to the event while I was actually expecting the usual edit dialog.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double click on any item in the calendar or right click and choose Open
2.Try to edit the item details.

Actual Results:  
When double clicking or choosing Open from the context menu instead of being able to edit the event details I'm getting a window to confirm all attendees to this event. For most events only my own name / e-mail is listed but I can in no way get to edit the actual event details. Not happening to every item but sure does to a lot of them!

Expected Results:  
I was expecting the usual event dialog with all event info filled in to be editted.

thanks to chris h. and dveditz for figuring this one out.

someone sent chris h. an email which used a background from some adware from
hotbar.com.

when you use mozilla or tbird to do a fwd-line the background gets included.

later when you compose you next new message that uses the same compose window
that you used for the fwd-inline you get the same background.

it sounds likes some style (or body attribute?) is persisting in the cached

I would guess there is an automatic fallback in how servers are setup so when we use sv in our accept-lang string the server would probably still serve Swedish but it's not certain it would give sv-se a higher priority than sv-fi if both existed.

The second two are easy tweaks to make it check out to the right dir and also to include the version number in the checkout path so it will work properly in the face of updated sources.

I also think given how the CVSROOT thing worked out that we should allow specifying the CVSROOT to use via environment variable so that we can get a solution that doesn't require touching srcsrv.ini. We can just see if SRCSRV_ROOT is set in the environment and use that instead of whatever we find from CVS/Root. That way we can just specify it in the mozconfig and everything works.

The menu item should load in the existing tab.  We probably don't need to destroy history indeed it would likely be annoying to do so but we should at least get the scam site off the screen.

fix tests as described

The Thebes tests haven't been built for a while apparently because they haven't been kept in sync with various Thebes API changes.

I've updated the tests so that they build and mostly work. I've also extended the font selection tests to work on Linux. And I've added a bunch of font selection test cases. I think these tests should be built whenever tests are enabled.

The font selection tests are a problem because they depend on precisely what fonts you have installed. For example my Windows XP install doesn't have MS UI Gothic so I fail font selection tests. This is hard to fix. One way to fix it would be to have the ability to restrict font selection to some hardcoded list of fonts (per platform) while testing and then check that those fonts actually exist on the user's system when they run the test.

In the font selection tests on Linux font fallback doesn't seem to work. I'm not sure why probably I didn't initialize something but I'm not sure what.",roc,roc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2007-03-19,0,3,2007-03-19,12,normal,2

CORE-395397,2007-09-07,Widget: Cocoa,CORE,Process Gecko events on demand in Cocoa widgets,"Created attachment 280078
Process Gecko events on demand using a CFRunLoopSource

At present Minefield processes Gecko events in a tight loop (repeated
calls to NS_ProcessNextEvent() in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) on the main
thread.  But this tight loop can be interrupted by modal activity (a
nested event loop that temporarily does its own event processing).
And unless the nested event loop also processes Gecko events Gecko
events will (temporarily) stop being processed.

Some of these nested event loops belong to the browser so they
(presumably) can take responsibility for processing Gecko events as
needed.  But others belong to the OS which knows nothing of Gecko
events.  Examples are native menus and context menus (only Camino
uses native context menus) plus the modal loop that runs while
someone is using a window's resize region (in the lower-right
corner) to resize it.  While these native event loops are running
no Gecko events are processed.  (For more information see bug 356720.)

The current nsAppShell.mm contains code (in ProcessGeckoEvents() and
ScheduleNativeEventCallback()) that's supposed to get around this
problem by also processing Gecko events on demand (triggered from
nsBaseAppShell::OnDispatchedEvent()).  But (for obscure timing
reasons about which more below) this code currently never processes
any Gecko events if we're also processing Gecko events in a tight loop
(in nsBaseAppShell::Run()).

My patch fixes this problem by no longer processing Gecko events in a
tight loop -- it _only_ processes Gecko events on demand.  As a
result Gecko events get processed even during native modal event
loops (and bug 356720 stops happening).

Several other changes were needed to make processing Gecko events only
on demand via a CFRunLoopSource work properly -- they're noted in the
patch's comments.

Camino currently only processes Gecko events on demand (it doesn't
call nsAppShell::Run() and doesn't process them in a tight loop).
But it uses a different method to schedule those events (not a
CFRunLoopSource) which still allows the processing of Gecko events to
stop during native modal event loops.  My patch's method fixes this
problem.

In principle it'd be nice to be able to process Gecko events on
demand _and also_ in a tight loop.  But that would require changes to
cross-platform widget code (in nsBaseAppShell.cpp particularly in
NativeEventCallback() and DoProcessNextNativeEvent()).

As far as I can tell my patch doesn't cause any event starvation
(Gecko or native).

Note (quoting from a comment in my patch):

nsBaseAppShell::NativeEventCallback() doesn't actually process any
Gecko events if elsewhere we're also processing Gecko events in a
tight loop (as happens in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) -- in that case
ProcessGeckoEvents() is always called while ProcessNextNativeEvent()
is running (called from nsBaseAppShell::OnProcessNextEvent()) and
mProcessingNextNativeEvent is always true (which makes
NativeEventCallback() take an early out).",smichaud,smichaud,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-09-01,1,53,2007-09-19,12,major,4

1. Go to mozilla.org (or just about any other web site).

necesssary in the version of Gecko you're using.)

Result: An extra vertical scrollbar appears.  Good so far.

4. Add a space.

Result: Weird stuff happens. For example a scrollbar appears at the left of the
page or the arrow on the top of a vertical scrollbar suddenly points left.  At
this point Firebird is more or less doomed to crash.

I then used simpler and simpler plans eventually submitting without adding anything (but still opening the edit window) and got the same error.  I then realized that when the edit window opened my cursor was in fact not all the way to the left -- if I backspaced and then submitted things were fine.  poking around a bit I discovered that the character is 0xa0 a non-breaking space and this has caused similar problems with XML parsers and suchlike.  

oddly enough this error does not occur when creating a test plan from scratch even though I see similar behavior with there being a space in the test plan document editing window when I open it (i.e. I can backspace to remove a character).  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  create a test plan with some minimal text (1 character) in the test plan document 
2.  clone this test plan choosing not to copy the test plan document
3.  click the edit document link to edit the test plan doc
4.  click in the edit window but make NO changes to the doc then click submit

17048) through Beonex.

(I excuse for using bugzilla.mozilla.org for that but we don't have a bugzilla
running at Beonex yet. If anybody from staff@mozilla.org has objections feel
free to close this as INVALID and I'll look for another forum.)

This is a meta-bug for all interesting in the funding ofo this general feature.
As pointed out the defintion is much too broad still to start this type of
funding. People have different needs. I will file new bugs for more concrete
suggestions and you can do so as well. Some of them might be functionally
subsets of others. Then you tell me what you would donate your money for.

There are several decisions to make some of which greatly influence the
architecture of the implementation:
- Should Mozilla sync during runtime or on startup/shutdown only?
- Client/server protocol used e.g.
  - HTTP PUT/MOVE
  - WebDAV
  - ACAP
I'll dig into my archive about the technical discussion for more questions.

In any case we could agree on a trustee who decides if the requirements have
been met (e.g. the mozilla.org module owner who does the review) and another one
that keeps the money in a safe place until Beonex (which probably means me)
meets the requirements. Not sure if that's necessary though (you tell me)
since it's (time- and money-costly) overhead.

A big thanks to Matt Perry who made this possible! He is the first person who
ever offered more than a pocket money for such a thing to Beonex. There's a
threshold before any action makes sense and he got us over it.",ben.bucksch,ben.bucksch,fixed,1,resolved,4,2016-07-15,7,49,2004-05-24,838,normal,2

WEBTOOLS_GRAVEYARD-152681,2002-06-18,Doctor,WEBTOOLS_GRAVEYARD,Preview button for doctor,"Doctor needs a preview button.  It would be nice if it would wrap html pages in
mozilla.org's template but that's not necessary.  It should add a reasonable
 to make it easy to check links.

Since preview will echo scripts back to the user security precautions are
necessary.  Otherwise another site could submit a page to preview with a
script that tries to read the user's stored CVS password.  (Compare bug 38862
for Bugzilla).

Possible security tricks:

1. Check the referer for a submit to preview.cgi and make sure it's doctor.cgi.  
This would lock out users who have disabled all referers (rather than only
cross-site referers) would not work for Beonex users who chose to use fake
referers (evil!) and I think it would break the HTTP spec.

2. Strip out script tags and event handlers.  
Not a good idea: this is hard to implement even harder to get right with the
huge number of event handlers and not forward-compatible with new versions of
IE with new event handlers.

3. Use a different hostname for preview.  Require that preview be done with
doctor-preview.mozilla.org rather than doctor.mozilla.org and require that all
other scripts be done with doctor.mozilla.org.  Make Doctor verify that the main
hostname (doctor.mozilla.org) and the preview hostname
(doctor-preview.mozilla.org) are neither identical and that neither is a
substring of the other.  
This would require additional work for anyone who wants to set up Doctor.

CORE-232567,2004-01-29,Networking: HTTP,CORE,Warn when HTTP URL auth information isn't necessary or when it's provided,"Mozilla needs to remove all support for username and password authentication in
the URL from HTTP HTTPS and HTTP with SSL. This problematic feature allows
URLs in the form of:

http://username1:password2@example.com

Currently when Mozilla gets that URL it takes the user to example.com and logs
the user in as username1 with password2. Unfortunately this can be
exploited. Indeed it has grown increasingly common that URLs in the form of
http://username:password@example.com are creating large security problems. Take
this example:

http://www.mozilla.org&item%3Dq:20933773d88383h2nf8dhdfjk3jk377d7djk3354@example.com/bad/evil/fraud/identitytheft

Following that URL a user might think he is going to the friendly confines of
mozilla.org. Unfortunately he ends up at the unfriendly confines of
http://example.com/bad/evil/fraud/identitytheft. 

This feature is being used today to harm and exploit our users. We have to respond.

Mozilla has made improvements in our handling of these URLs. Further
improvements are on the drawing board. 

Neverthless any improvements ultimately cannot raise our level of security high
enough. We can try to fashion a dialog box or even highlight the URL in an eye
catching manner. User education must accompany any such enhancement of course.
The Internet will always have many new inexperienced and uneducated users.
Even experienced users sometimes click on the wrong URLs by accident. Therefore
it is inevitable that many Mozilla users will be exploited by this feature no
matter how we improve on it.

The only way to really solve the problem once and for all is to rip out URL
authentication altogether.

RFC 1738 may indeed require that an HTTP(S) implementation (like Mozilla) honor
URL authentication. 

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1738.html

Allowing these kinds of URLs was fine a few years ago. Today however it
creates a security hole ever more commonly exploited. The Mozilla Project does
need to honor standards. Yet when the purpose of a certain standard is no
longer relevant or is outweighed by other concerns--such as security--then we
have to react to the changing real world conditions. Today the cost of
supporting this feature far outweighs the benefit. By removing this feature we
will fix a major security hole for good.

Microsoft has announced it will remove support for these URLs.

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb[LN]834489

Since MSIE currently has an 80%+ market share most sites that make use of this
feature will soon give it up. Thus when Mozilla follows suit and removes the
feature our userbase will not be terribly aggrieved.

one way I typically run the viewer to look at lots of files quickly is like

what this command line does is load the url's in the file top100.txt with a 
minimum 10 second delay (longer if the file takes longer than 15 seconds to 
load.)  this lets me scan many pages quickly without having to type in any urls 
or click any links.  to run through the top 100 quickly to verify no crashes or 
asserts I use -d 0.

what I see is if I set the delay to a very small number 0 or 1 it works fine.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

PageX/Y represent the horizontal/vertical coordinates of an event relative to the whole document.  This differs from clientX/clientY which are the horizontal/vertical coordinate within the application's client area.  When you scroll a document and then fire an event the pageY should be the clientY + scrolldata.

This works as expected in FF2 and it works in FF3 when clicking manually.  But when manually dispatching events in FF2 pageY would include scrolldata in FF3 pageY does not include scrolldata but ONLY when manually dispatching.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the attached page in FF3.  This page includes a 4000px spacer div followed by two buttons: report pageY and Simulate mouseup on the other button.  During onload a mouseup is automatically simulated.
Actual Results:  
You'll see the word FAIL in the body of the page because pageY is less than 4000.  If you manually click on report pageY you'll see the word PASS in the body of the page.  You may also manually click on the simulate mouseup button to get the word FAIL to appear again.  On my machine pageY is typically ~1000px.

Expected Results:  
The word PASS should appear in the body of the page regardless of whether you push the left button or the right button.  pageY should always be >4000.

This bug was discussed elsewhere in bug 411031 and bug 405632. This regression  caused a bug in Microsoft's Virtual Earth maps which depended on the behavior of pageY.

There is no public standard for the behavior of pageY but there is a defacto standard behavior: FF2 Safari 3.1 and Opera 9.5 all behave the same way (they all say PASS when you load up the page).

Build Identifier: 

Darwin/gtk uses the traditional UNIX layout but there are places in the build that assume Darwin = bundle.  The cleanest solution is to create a single new variable to describe this that has options for:

traditional : The traditional unix layout (placing the startup script in bin libs etc in mozilla_five_home etc)
bundle : Create a NextStep / Darwin / OSX style bundle (ie: Firefox.app)
winnt : windows stuff (I have no real understanding of how that works but I assume we'd replace most of the OS=WINNT with this check)

patch

Spun out of bug 463605 comment 8.  This is a quick Ts win for OS X packages.  Instead of blocking on bug 463605 Ted says maybe we can take this patch.

XPT linking is done for all platforms except OS X and from what I understand its purpose is perf.  Some DTracing bears that out.  I wrote a script that captures time spent in I/O syscalls during startup.  With a single linked XPT the time spent during these calls during cold startup drops more than an order of magnitude from nearly 300ms to 10ms.  A caveat is that I did not see a conclusive matching drop in wall clock time and I'm not sure yet why.

Here's some data that shows time spent on each XPT during cold startup and the associated syscalls.  Numbers are durations in ms.  (Hope this isn't too hard to read in bugzilla!)

Here are three different examples that leads to an assertion.

A bit of debug output on the first example at the top:

The damage area setup is wrong... the root of the problem IMO is the 'aRowSpan'

value (2) which is the result of:

The problem also occurs for aRowSpanIsZero is false though -
see the second example.

The third is also a zero rowspan case although it triggers the assertion

We want to ship Fennec with a good list of search engines for Hungarian. As the technical details of implementation are being worked on we'd like to start the discussion about the choice of search engines. This bug is about agreeing on a set of search engines and will not tackle the implementation (at least not yet).

First the localization team and Staś will look at the market for the locale and come up with a good set of search providers. The guidelines for making recommendations are on https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mobile/Productization. You're welcome to suggest engines already shipped in desktop Firefox for Hungarian if they fit well in the categories outlined on the wiki.

For en-US we currently use the following set which may serve as an inspiration:
Google Wikipedia Amazon Yahoo Twitter.

Note that according to the guidelines for some categories it may be better to leave them empty than to ship with en engine that's irrelevant or unavailable in your region.

After we decided on a particular search engine we will need to test it in Fennec. You can test on a mobile device and on the desktop (download the builds from ). Staś will help with testing on a device too. If the service works fine Staś will contact the owner and ask for permission and for specifics like proper search flags. $name we'll likely need your help to at least get the contact information if we don't have them already.

We don't know the implementation details yet so for now please don't create patches nor land anything. We will keep you posted as we figure out the how's and when's.

specify what OS they would like to use to perform the verification below.

2) A Mozilla representative creates a test build of NSS with the new

SEAMONKEY-478800,2009-02-16,MailNews: Message Display,SEAMONKEY,Drop-down 'View:' menu displays 'undefined' when you try and use Tags or Custom Views,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081202 SeaMonkey/2.0a2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081202 SeaMonkey/2.0a2

If you try and use any of the following View message options: Tags Custom Views


(View menu then Messages submenu) or the drop-down view menu and then close e-mail client then re-open seamonkeys e-mail client the drop-down 'View:' menu displays the word 'undefined'

It should also be noted that if you choose any of the Tags (e.g. 'Important') the drop-down 'View:' menu will immediately display the tag you chose e.g.
'Important'

If you then close the e-mail client and then re-open the e-mail client the drop-down 'View:' menu will then display the word 'undefined'

Unlike the Custom Views option which will make the drop-down 'View:' menu display the word 'undefined' immediately.


If you make a New personal Custom View and give a certain criteria then choose to use your custom view it will work even though the 'View:'
drop-down menu displays the word 'undefined'.


The only e-mail that will display is the one that meets the custom view requirement i set even though the drop-down       

'View:' menu displays the word 'undefined' in it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To Reproduce Symptoms:

1. Send yourself an e-mail that has the words (for example) 'i really like technicians because they know a lot' in the subject line.

2. For your 'Inbox' Folder create a new custom view called 'Bens Custom' from the drop-down 'View:' menu and use the following criteria:

Goto Customize then goto New and create the following:



Drop-down menu 1:     Drop-down menu 2:     Data Entry Field:

Subject               Contains              technicians



3. goto the drop-down 'View:' menu then to the 'Custom Views' sub-menu and choose 'Bens Custom'

4. Quit seamonkey e-mail client (or seamonkey completely) and re-enter seamonkeys e-mail client


Actual Results:  
A. The drop-down 'View:' menu will display 'undefined' in it.
B. Only the E-mail that has the word 'technicians' in the subject line is displayed even though the drop-down 'View:' menu displays the word 'undefined'

Expected Results:  
Expected the drop-down 'View:' menu to show the name of the chosen Tag or the Custom View options name (including Newly Created Custom Views)

Sometimes if you click a couple of times (sometimes between 1 to 31 times) between the e-mail Folder you set the View Criteria up on and the Inbox and/or Drafts folder with the mouse the drop-down 'View:' menu might suddenly correctly
display the actual name of the Custom View when you have clicked on the e-mail folder that you decided to set the custom view up on (in this case E-mail folder = 'Inbox' Custom View  = 'Bens Custom').

NOTE: Not sure wether this constitutes a potential privacy and/or a security
      issue. User may want to use view message filter to filter out certain
      e-mails so as to not have other people in public areas see certain
      e-mail addresses or names of people but does not mind if public can see
      certain e-mail addresses. E-mail names and addressess could have

Patch

While looking into other bugs I found some unreachable code in
ssl_DestroySID and ssl_LookupSID lib/ssl/sslnonce.c.

1. ssl_DestroySID: In this function sid->references must be 0. Code
inspection shows that if |sid| is in the client cache the client
cache will own a reference. This implies |sid| cannot be in the
client cache. So sid->cached == in_client_cache will never be true.
I replaced the check with an assertion.

2. ssl_LookupSID: The function asserts sid->references >= 1 so the
two !sid->references tests will always be false.

Perhaps in the past NSS used to leave orphaned (reference count 0)
sid's in the client cache and clean them up later.",wtc,wtc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-02-20,0,2,2014-01-03,22,trivial,1

When a path is used to create its segments and they are inserted into it the xml representation is correct (as per firebug) but the pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter returns wrong values for SVGPathSegCurvetoQuadraticAbs:ses and SVGPathSegCurvetoCubicSmoothAbs:ses return wrong letters.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have any page open. Even a simple like:


Letters fail




	Sorry this isn't one of those visually impressive problems.




Will suffice.
2. Execute the following code:

var path1=document.createElementNS(svgnspath)
var sseg=path1.createSVGPathSegCurvetoCubicSmoothAbs(50402060)

path2.pathSegList.appendItem(sseg)


alert(Should be S:+path1.pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter)
alert(Should be Q:+path2.pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter)


3.The alerts should state the problem. For Google Chrome and Opera show the correct ones so I'm pretty sure I'm not the one who's mixed up the letters.
Actual Results:  
Well the given letters are not the same as they are in the dom's view of the xml (seen from firebug) and the specification. This is shown by the alert boxes.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 nl rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

At http://www.mozbrowser.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5645 a bug in Firefox is mentioned. Someone browses to a webpage that does not exist anymore. Therefore the hosting provider (Lycos) redirects to their portal (www.jubii.dk). Firefox asks whether the user wants to 'close the page' (sounds like a warning before a Javascript window.close or something) and redirects. But before the new page is completely build Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://medlem.jubii.dk/easyastth/kazaa%20lite%20resurrection/kazaa%20lite%20resurrection.html with Javascript enabled
2. Wait for the warning from Firefox
3. Click OK or Cancel and watch Firefox crash
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Redirect is performed without problems.

To narrow the problem down:
When one uses the Escape-key to cancel the Firefox-warning no crash happens. But when one clicks on Cancel the browser still crashes. People who block Javascript do not have a problem. People who use Linux also report no problems. This is also reported with Firefox 1.0.7 on Windows9x.",timeless,weisbeek,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-06-09,0,8,2006-01-29,49,critical,5

CORE-480134,2009-02-25,Graphics,CORE,Heap/integer overflows during font glyph rendering reachable in FF and Camino (libpango CoreGraphics),"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 10.5 en-US rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 10.5 en-US rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6

Both Firefox and Camino are exposed to a font rendering integer overflow which exists independently in libpango and in Apple's CoreGraphics (ripc).

I have reported the bug upstream to Apple but they have no timeline to fix. (Yes this affects Safari too..)

The issue is in URL bar rendering.  If a very long document.location is set via javascript the integer overflow is reachable.  The files at the above location show this bug for each.  

The affected code in pango is in pango_glyph_string_set_size:
An overflow check when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation:
  string->glyphs = g_realloc (string->glyphs string->space * sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo))

I don't have a live exploit but this looks exploitable.  I have not yet gotten this reported upstream to libpango.  It is pending on their mailing list and I've received no response.

Because of their delay and Apple's delay I thought it would make the most sense to put a maximum limit on the document.location.

This will be referenced with advisory oCERT-2009-001.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a pango crasher in http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/
   E.g. http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_2.html
2. Crash.

Depending on how the overflow is handled you can get it to proceed without a crash.

(Note I've been tinkering with the crashers so there's nothing special about the different versions just a few tweaks.)
Actual Results:  
In camino it is often a NULL deref.  I can get a few other random stack-addresses visible but I haven't done a thorough analysis on the Apple libraries to know.

In ff pango exposes the num_glyphs after a successful underallocation.  If this is used for writing to the glyph array it will result in heap corruption.

Expected Results:  
Maximum URL length and/or integer overflow checks in libpango/ripc would stop this.

Please let me know if I can help coordinate anything.  I can be reached at my personal address: redpig@dataspill.org or at my oCERT addr: redpig@ocert.org.

I will be pursuing getting this upstream to pango but if you have any contacts that can help that'd be great.

In addition if you have some idea for Camino fixes if you plan to release the crashers please let me know in advance.  I would like to negotiate some embargo date with Apple if possible but who knows.",vladimir,redpig,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-03-31,0,36,2009-04-08,42,critical,5

The problem is basically that almost all of the converter classes contain no
actual code - they just map to a generated in-memory table. We have the overhead
of a class which derives from a shared base class

basically we have something like this:

class nsUnicodeToFoo : nsBaseEncoder {

  nsUnicodeToFoo() : nsBaseEncoder(table1 ...) {}

}

and then later declare a constructor
NS_GENERIC_FACTORY_CONSTRUCTOR(nsUnicodeToFoo)

and then put
nsUnicodeToFooConstructor in the generic module header.

Here's what we can do instead:

for each class we instead ditch the actual class and just write a custom
constructor:

nsUnicodeToFooConstructor() {
  return CreateBaseEncoder(g_FooTable ...)
}

and allow all constructors to share a common constructor:
CreateBaseEncoder(table ...) {
  return new nsBaseEncoder(table...)
}

I have a bookmark with a keyword set up for Google search (the bookmark is http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnG=Google+Search&meta= and the keyword is 'goo').  When I type the following into the address bar

goo at&t hobbit cpu

it incorrectly (I think) ends up as

http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=at&t%20%22hobbit%22%20cpu&btnG=Google+Search&meta=

with the '&' between the 'at' and 't' as the value of the 'q' parameter which also causes the other parts of the 'q' value to be incorrectly interpreted by Google.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a bookmark with the location 'http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnG=Google+Search&meta='
2. set the bookmark keyword to 'goo'
3. type 'goo at&t hobbit cpu' into the address bar

Actual Results:  
I got a search for the letters 'AT'

Expected Results:

=========================

1. open any event or create a new one by context menu or double click inside say the week view
2. position mouse cursor inside the Start: date or time text field
3. edit any value per keyboard - do not use the drop down calendar picker
4. close dialog via mouse click on Save and Close button

Actual result:
==============

Nothing has changed edited values have not been saved

I used the windowsupdate.com site to install a number of non-critical updates
(most of them for hardware such as WLAN card modem mouse touchpad etc.)
and I was prompted to restart the computer.  After the restart Firefox wouldn't start.  Each attempt at starting Firefox would lead the firefox.exe process to terminate almost immediately *without* causing a crash.  So unfortunately there are no talkback IDs to report.  Check out bug #355594 which is a similar problem on the same machine and at the same time happening with Thunderbird as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to start Firefox.
2. Watch nothing happening (because the process is silently terminating.)
3. Start Firefox in Safe Mode.
4. Disable the Talkback extension.
5. Close Firefox.
6. Start Firefox in normal mode.
7. Watch the browser open fine.
8. Enable the Talkback extension.
9. Restart Firefox.
10. Watch nothing happening (like before.)

I could go on and on with the same procedure.

========
All international characters will appeare correctly
Submit will succeed.

Observed
========
Some international characters were shown incorrectly
Submit failed with message A legal component must be selected

Reason
======
All HTML pages miss encoding information and when browser selects some 
default it is sometime incorrect.

Solution
========
Edit header.html.tmpl and add line into HTML header with encoding (I used

CORE-21069,1999-12-07,Selection,CORE,Solid vs. Transparent Highlight,"________________________________
Overview Description:

Mozilla's transparent highlight looks cool but interferes with readability on
poorly designed sites.

Meaning if I'm on a site with a background that interferes with my reading the
text I highlight the text (white on dark blue in NS4) in order to read it
easier. Since the highlight in M11 inverts all the colors I cannot do this.

_________________________________
Steps to Reproduce:

1.) Open Gecko layout engine and open Sample Test #1
2.) Scroll to the bottom
3.) Highlight the H3 with the gear background and try to read it

_________________________________
Actual Results:

All colors are simply inverted

_________________________________
Suggested Results:

A highlight with two fixed contrasting colors

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a testcase.
2. Load another page in the same tab (e.g. your home page).
3. Press Back.

Result: Crash.


Stack from a nightly build:

0    PresShell::Freeze() + 420
1    PresShell::EnumeratePlugins(nsIDOMDocument* nsString const& void (*)(PresShell* nsIContent*)) + 236
2    PresShell::Thaw() + 132
3    nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory() + 2744
4    nsDocShell::CaptureState() + 668
5    PL_HandleEvent + 36
6    PL_ProcessPendingEvents + 128

Security-sensitive due to suspicious stack -- how does PresShell::Freeze end up on the top of the stack?  PresShell::EnumeratePlugins only appears to call GetElementsByTagName and (through the callback) StartPluginInstance.

In a debug build there are two assertion failures and the stack makes more sense: StartPluginInstance is at the top and the rest is the same.

###!!! ASSERTION: Object nodes must implement nsIObjectLoadingContent: 'objlc' file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp line 6234
Break: at file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp line 6234
###!!! ASSERTION: You can't dereference a NULL nsCOMPtr with operator->().: 'mRawPtr != 0' file ../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h line 849
Break: at file ../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h line 849


I think the problem is that EnumeratePlugins assumes that anything with the tagname object that QI's to nsIContent is safe to pass to its callback but StartPluginInstance assumes that its argument can QI's to nsIObjectLoadingContent.  Possible fixes:

(A) Make EnumeratePlugins use GetElementsByTagNameNS so it only sees  not all  elements.

(B) Make StartPluginInstance test for nsIObjectLoadingContent instead of asserting and then crashing.",cbiesinger,jruderman,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-06-09,0,8,2006-01-15,8,normal,2

The right column has three images each with text underneath much like a

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on an *image* in right column say the firefox logo on black
background above the other merchandise caption.


Actual Results:  
There is just one item a decal.  The other categories also appear to have just
one product.  Quite disappointing.  


Expected Results:  
Page listing other mechandise with several items.  Ditto for other categories.

Much later I clicked on another link and found that there are category listing
pages.  It turns out the problem is that in the right column the image links to
just the representative product pictured rather than to the expected list of
all the merchandise in the category named by the caption.

The right column has three images each with text underneath like labeled
icons.  It looks like 3 links not 6.

To avoid this confusion I suggest something like one of the following.  Either:

a. make it so clicking on the image above other merchandise links to the other
merchandise listing not just the one product (and ditto for other categories).  Or

b. add name of each featured product such as firefox decal under each image
so the image has its own caption and other merchandise category is clearly a
separate link.

After clearing private data the information may still remain in the .sqlite file although it can no longer be accessed by Firefox and SQLite.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you haven't cleared your data in a long time (a few weeks)
2. Close Firefox.
3. Back up your data in your profile folder.
4. Start Firefox and go to Tools > Clear Private Data.
5. Check all the boxes and press the Clear Private Data Now button.
6. Open a .sqlite file (cookies.sqlite for example) with a text editor.
Actual Results:  
The sqlite file is still the same size and except for some changes in the beginning it is identical. Personal data can can be easily read since it is in plain text.

Expected Results:  
No traces of the user's data should be left. If a user clears private data there must be a reason for doing so so it should not be so easily recoverable.

With the most recent Trunk builds - using 2006051020 (1.2+) - the browser fails to connect to websites after it has been idle for a moment. It shows 'loading' in the statusbar but the site is never loaded.

Other symptoms observed: clicking on a link does nothing anymore.

This has happened in two ways:
load page then go reading your email  back to browser and it is dead
load page let it sit there while I was looking at another browser on another computer.

First noticed with my own build (checkout start: Thu May 11 08:33:57 JST 2006) and now with the  2006051020 (1.2+) 'Maya' build.

MAILNEWS_CORE-235004,2004-02-20,Networking: IMAP,MAILNEWS_CORE,Compact | Folders (IMAP purge) updates inode change time (ctime) on *all* server's mail files even if not changed,"User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040218

Doing a Compact | Folders remove email marked as deleted causes the IMAP
server's mail file to have its UNIX inode change time (ctime) updated even when
there were no changes made to the folder (i.e. no mails deleted).

Now that Compact | Folders actually compacts every single mail folder for this
account this is suddenly a real problem: *all* my mail folders' ctimes are
updated even for folders I've not viewed for months let alone deleted emails from.

The reason this is a problem is backups: my nightly incrementals are now running
at 2GB almost all of which are mail folders that have not been written to for
months. They're still backup up since their ctimes have changed.

e.g these mail folders have not been written to (or even read) for almost a year:

diz $ ls -l accounting Cellini Feltech Honkers 
-rw-------    1 calum    calum       99926 2003-04-09 14:49 accounting
-rw-------    1 calum    calum        5483 2003-04-09 15:00 Cellini
-rw-------    1 calum    calum      240548 2003-04-09 15:06 Feltech
-rw-------    1 calum    calum       26510 2003-04-09 15:26 Honkers

yet they appear in my nightly incrementals every night since their ctimes get
updates every time I do a Compact | Folders:

diz $ ls -lc accounting Cellini Feltech Honkers 
-rw-------    1 calum    calum       99926 2004-02-20 11:44 accounting
-rw-------    1 calum    calum        5483 2004-02-20 11:44 Cellini
-rw-------    1 calum    calum      240548 2004-02-20 11:44 Feltech
-rw-------    1 calum    calum       26510 2004-02-20 11:44 Honkers

This causes my incrementals to fail as the week progresses since there's not
enough room on the tape :(

The IMAP server (Uow imapd 2002e in my case) is what's actually doing this of
course but it's in response to mozilla's purge request.

Would it be possible not to do a folder purge if the folder contains no deleted
messages? I think this might be a workaround...

setting the hash output's length in octets to the base

There is another complication.  Since we store the hash

CORE-528857,2009-11-15,JavaScript Engine,CORE,nanojit: mismanagement of name lifetimes with TMFLAGS=assembly?,"I'm seeing some screwy behaviour with TMFLAGS=assembly.  Names get associated with instructions for the debug output.  AFAICT memory holding LIR is being recycled -- eg. different instructions in different fragments that are compiled at different times may end up at the same address in memory.  However the LirNameMap seems to be staying live across the compilation of these different fragments and so inappropriate names are being given to instructions in the second fragment.

I've attached some output that shows this.  First I turned off addName() which manually names some interesting instructions because it just confuses things.  'xt69' is the instruction name of interest.  It appears in a fragment on line 3881:

  0x9fc5d90: xt69: xt eq136 -> pc=0x9febb2f imacpc=(nil) sp+56 rp+0 (GuardID=094)

'xt69' is an appropriate name for a LIR_xt instruction.  'xt69' appears again a couple of fragments later:

  0x9fc5d90: xt69 = int 12

I added some code to print the address of LIR_xt and LIR_int instructions and you can see it's the same address ie. the memory has been recycled.  But the LirNameMap seemingly hasn't been recycled so 'xt69' is still associated with addres 0x9fc5d90 even thought the LIR instruction at that location has changed and we use it inappropriately.

Graydon you understand the allocator lifetimes... any idea what's going on here?  The LirNameMap is using 'alloc' as its allocator whereas the LirBuffer is using 'tempAlloc'.  I thought they should use the same one because the lifetime of a LIR fragment should match the lifetime of its LirNameMap.  So I tried changing LirNameMap to use 'tempAlloc' but I got crashes and Valgrind diagnoses bazillions of use-after-free errors.  Then I tried changing LirBuffer to use 'alloc' and the problem goes away but that extends the LirBuffer's lifetime inappropriately I think.",n.nethercote,n.nethercote,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-12-18,0,14,2009-12-18,33,normal,2

1. Name clashes

We could quite easily get name clashes with existing attributes depending on
what element the current interface is exposed on. If somebody extends an already
existing input control there is a good chance that .value already exists. The
could also apply to f.x. isReadonly.

2. Using attributes

If somebody wants to implement the controls in pure javascript I've been told
that some browsers do not let you watch attribute changes so it would not be
possibly to implement .value.

To fix problem 2) we need to only use functions. To fix problem 1) I have two
possible solutions:
A) Use a context object like canvas does. That is have one
.getXFormsAccessors() function that returns a new object where the above
interface is implemented.

B) Prefix every function with f.x. form. So we would have .formIsReadonly().

I like A) best but the problem is that when I tried to implement it I hit some

The given URL has some default styles and an alternate stylesheet for handhelds

When filling the View->Page Style menu Firefox thinks he doesn't have to show the entry default page style because there is a preferred stylesheet set (a stylesheet with title attribute).

Unfortunately the preferred stylesheet has media=handheld so it is not displayed in the menu and Firefox isn't displaying this the menu too.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load given URL
2. Open menu View->Page Style
Actual Results:  
There is only an entry for No Style if you select No Style you can't switch back

Expected Results:  
There should be the menuitem Default Style

The problem is in function stylesheetFillPopup(menuPopup) in browser.js

The security warning for opening exes borrowed from IE6 SP2 should be reverted to the Firefox 2 for various reasons:

- Depends on Windows version (XP Vista / no SP SP1 SP2) and IE version. A browser should not depend on another one!
- Can not be disabled from the warning box itself in contrast to the Firefox 2 warning. (The check box in the IE box only disables it for one file)
- The only way to disable it is in the IE settings Dialog box! Changing settings for Firefox using the IE settings dialog box is completely ironic and not user friendly.
- People who uninstalled IE with a program such as XPLite (Like me) are not able to change the setting! Uninstalling IE is not a too rare thing among Mozilla fans.

Please reconsider the warning box or implement it in a way which is less dependent on IE.

CORE-107122,2001-10-27,Layout,CORE," elements  do not honor left and right margins in style","One way to make a centered ruled with a proportional width is to set the left
and right margins in a style attribute.
Ex. (in XHTML) :  for a 20% with
rule.
Mozilla 0.9.5 Redhat 7 rpm build fails to honor the style whether the margins
are proportional or absolute.
In the proportional case the rule is offset to the right as much as 200% of the
screen width. The rule itself is about a 100% wide. You have to scroll by a
large amount to see it.
In the absolute case Mozilla correctly takes into account the left margin but
fails to honor the right margin. The rule seems to have a 100% width so you have
 to scroll to the right by the width of the left margin to see its end.
This behaviour shows up in xhtml and html (loose DTD). I did not test other
documents type.
The margins show up as expected under Netscape 4.78 Amaya 5.1 Internet
Explorer 5 (Windows 2K). Netscpae 6.1 (Windows 2K) exhibit the same behaviour as
Mozilla.

No.  Once an NSPR thread is create joinable or unjoinable
there is no way to change that attribute.  I'm not sure
whether that's an oversight or a conscious design decision.

Pthreads has the operation you want: pthread_detach.

It's not hard to work around this limitation.  You'd create
all your threads PR_UNJOINABLE_THREAD.  Then you use a
thread count and a condition variable to synchronize with
them when the thread pool gets destroyed like this:

void WorkerThread(void *arg)
{
    ....
    // need to exit either voluntarily or because the
    // thread pool is being destroyed.
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)
    if (--thread_count == 0) {
        PR_NotifyCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
}

void TheThreadThatDestroysTheThreadPool(void *arg)
{
    ...
    // signals all the threads in the pool to exit
    ...
    // synchronize with them
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)  // you might already be holding this
lock when you signal the threads to exit
    while (thread_count) {
        PR_WaitCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
    ....
}

I will take a look at your new thread pool code tonight.

Build Identifier: Version 2.0.0.0 (20070326)

Since the latest (Dutch) version of Thunderbird (Version 2.0.0.0 (20070326) ) my mails are marked as read when they arrive in my mailbox. I see them arriving and they are marked as unread. After the message in the right corner shows me the mail information (sender short summary of the mail) the mail is marked as read.

When I disable the option that shows the message in the right corner the mail keeps marked as unread until I read the message.

It only happens with all my IMAP accounts not with RSS feeds or POP3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on the option to show the message in the right corner with mail summary and sender.
2. Send yourself a new email to an IMAP account.
3. When you receive the mail the mail will be shown as read when the message in the right corner dissapears.
4. Now disable this option in the preference menu.
5. Send yourself a new email to an IMAP account.
6. When you receive the mail the mail will be shown as unread even after a few seconds.

We need a mechanism in the event system that allows the textwidget to tell 
how/why it got focus. This is neccessary because on some platforms tabbing into 
a textwidget is supposed to select all it's contents and any other method of 
focus gain leaves the selection/caret in the textwidget where it was before.",blizzard,kinmoz,fixed,1,resolved,4,2019-03-13,1,27,2009-08-19,3002,normal,2
THUNDERBIRD-476836,2009-02-04,General,THUNDERBIRD,(Activity Manager) %s should be added in plural-form messages,"This a bug is related to plural-form messages especially those located in Activity Manager.

In Arabic locale (I don't know if this applies on other locales too) for some numbers (precisely for n = 0 1 or 2) the noun that succeeds the number doesn't need any preceding number because the meaning of the number is within the noun it self i.e. if you're saying 'two-days' (it is one word in Arabic) it makes a bit non-sense to say '2 two-days'. In order to solve that if we have a plural message (let's say '%s days') '%s' is removed for entries where n = 0 1 or 2.

Now the problem is that many plural messages doesn't contain a '%s' within (e.g. 'days=daydays' in mail/chrome/messenger/activity.properties) which means that the '%s' is externally added and the localizer can't remove the '%s' for n=012.

My request is to unify the structure of localized plural messages and make sure that all of them become as 'days=%s day%s days' instead of 'days=daydays'.


Besides some other messages need to have the plural-form too (like 'autoRetry=Trying again in %S seconds' in the same file).


Note: That bug is *not* related to the plural-form rules but to the format of plural messages.

Why is the Options... dialog modal? No changed in the options dialog will result in an immediate change of rendering of tabs or other parts of the window. So I don't understand why it should block the rest of the window. Furthermore if you are new to Firefox and you use a tutorial to change some props you can't switch between the tut and the options dialog (that's not quite comfortable). The only thing you could do is open another window of Firefox and change the options there.
So I think the options shouldn't be modal.

And another problem with child dialogs:
If I open the Add-ons dialog from the options dialog there are all three controls - close full size and minimize - but at least the minimize-control doesn't make any sense. If I minimize the addon dialog I still can't do anything in the options dialog because the addon dialog is modal too. Why? If I open the addon dialog from the menu Tools it isn't modal. But from Options it is. Doesn't make any sense to me...
(All the other dialogs opened from Options that have these three controls aren't modal.)

And last: In the Advanced tab of Options many buttons haven't got the ... at the end even tough they open a new dialog.

EXPECTED RESULTS: Pass

ACTUAL RESULTS: Fail

DETAILS: The problem is that the window provider implementation starts an about:blank load in the window it provides.  This can't be worked around in that implementation easily since just appending a  into the DOM starts such a load in it the only way to fix this on the provider side would be to either explicitly call stop() or to nor return from provideWindow until the load completes (which is what happens when we actually open a new window).  Given the difficulty of doing the latter I think the right solution is to just call stop() in the window watcher.",bzbarsky,bzbarsky,fixed,1,resolved,4,2006-08-14,0,9,2006-08-11,1,normal,2

As long as Firefox needs to use random filenames for helper app files (due to bug 230606) it should make sure they're truly unpredictable.  Do we have something that can provide good random bits to C++ code maybe in NSS?

wrap due to layout wrapping it like it would any other chunk of text?  In more

This makes me wonder if there are times when the group is set on non-new bugs that I'm not getting mail for and of course not knowing when a bug goes public is itself a potentially bad thing.

Could this have something to do with UNCONFIRMED bugs? I don't know if this has always been true but the recent ones that have exhibited this problem were all UNCO bugs. Could the security@mozilla.org account be set not to be mailed on UNCO bugs?

Detailed Steps to Reproduce the Problem:  

1.	Install Windows 7
2.	Install Firefox from www.firefox.com
3.	Launch Firefox
4.	Dock it to the right of the screen using mouse 
5.	Minimize Firefox (using the minimize button or Winkey + M)
6.	Restore Firefox by clicking on the icon in the Superbar
7.	Actual Result - Firefox is restored to its location before it was docked to the right of the screen

Note:  This behavior is not consistent with other Internet Browsers: Internet Explorer.

Tester/Developer Notes: 

Firefox was installed on a machine and launched.  The size of the window of Firefox was adjusted using the WinKey +M and then re-sized using the icon on the Superbar however Firefox did not resume it original position on the screen.

Al's Note: I don't see the Superbar (just gadgets) in the public build of Windows 7 so I was unable to verify this bug. Marking this for 1.9.1 by default but we should find out what version of Firefox was used and if we can get access to a more current Windows 7 build.",jmathies,abillings,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-09-15,2,17,2009-08-11,113,major,4

Build Identifier: Problem is in every build since 0.8 which works fine (Tried it with the final 0.9 and now with the latest 1.0pre) Thunderbird is 2.0.0.21 and with the 1.0pre I'm using 3.0b2

Ok

I'm in no means a developper and prob can't tell you all the right things but this bug is preventing us from moving from Lightning 0.8 to 0.9 so I need to file this bug.

We are using atm 0.8 version of the thunderbird plugin in our company. It works fine with our Sun Calendar Server (6.3 patch rel 121657-30). When upgrading to 0.9 and with the latest 1.0pre we encountere a following problem:

When creating a new event and inviting people to attend to it no invitations are sent. When checking the event from the calendar server it doesn't show it as being done by you but as you would have invited yourself to the meeting.

When opening the event again in lightning and closing it you are promted for saving changes even if no chages are done.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start creating a new event
2.Select people to invite
3.Save the event
Actual Results:  
You appear to invite yourself instead of making your own event and inviting others.

Expected Results:  
You create a new event for yourself and invite others.

I did trace the difference in the query sent by thunderbird to the sun calendar server and one major thing is different. When it is working in 0.8 we are sending this value: orgCalid	userid@domain.fi
and when it is not working in 0.9 and 1.0 pre we are sending only this value:
orgEmail	mailto:userid@domain.fi
Otherwise the sent packages look quite the same. There is some timezone info that is different but I assume that it has nothing to do with this.

So to me it looks like lightning is a bit unsure who I am and acts like I'm only some random inviter instead of beeing me.

Making events where no one is invited work just fine in 1.0pre so it only goes wrong when you invite people.

The only file I can find using that orcalId is this:calWcapCalendarItems.js
There are differences with the code between 0.8 and 1.0pre (Quite obvius).

since aScheme seems to be an in parameter it should be const. but the scheme
could be gotten off the URI too why pass it here?

+  NS_ENSURE_ARG_POINTER(aNotificationCallbacks)

this should not be a runtime check since people who pass NULL to a get
function totally deserve what they get. also scripts can't do that.

+  return NS_OK       // don't fail when trying to set this

the comment seems to be pointless now that this function actually does
something

when can this be null? same in destroyExtProtoEvent


Two more issues:
1. the code asserts that it being a channel has
notificationCallbacks set and that it can get an nsIPrompt off
them...  but necko does not require to have an nsIPrompt available on the
notificationCallbacks this should be a NS_WARNING.

the lock overhead inherent in the JS rooting call. And it only happens at GC
time rather than each time the refcount on the wrapped natives makes a 1->2 or
2->1 transition.

We might see some measureable improvement in DOM manipulation benchmarks.

I'll attach a patch. I was working on dealing with bug 112152 too. So this
patch has some associated code that will be needed for that fix but which is
not *strictly* needed yet for this smaller fix. We should test this more and see
if anything unexpectedly expodes :)",jstenback+bmo,jband_mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-02-05,0,12,2009-02-05,2481,normal,2

The fix

I saw this on the bloat boxes the other day when I'd temporarily let the what's new page check be broken and so it was actually being shown and causing a lot of leaks.

The issue is that we're setting up a c++ instance (the nsBrowserStatusFilter) with a listener (tabProgressListener) that is holding onto the tab object (mTab et al) which is then holding onto the c++ instance.

We need to break this cycle when we close the tab - so we save the listener and then remove it later.

I would also like to enable the content tab in the bloat tests but it appears when we switch/close the content tab back to the main 3 pane tab we're causing a bunch of other leaks - so I'll raise a bug on following that up as well and that can be the one to enable the content tab on the leak tests.",standard8,standard8,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-10-02,0,2,2009-10-02,1,normal,2

Hi!

Thunderbird 1.5.0.8 reproducably loses mails that are moved from local folders to remote IMAP folders in offline mode on at least Windows XP and Linux.

Best regards
Christian

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When not in offline mode create a mail and save it to a remote folder.
2. Drag the mail to a local folder.
3. Switch to offline mode without downloading messages for offline use.
4. Drag the mail back to a remote folder.
5. Turn off offline mode.
Actual Results:  
The mail is lost and it seems to be impossible to recover.

Expected Results:  
As long as in offline mode the mail should be cached somewhere.  It should be displayed (including message body) when viewing the remote folder.  When switching to online mode it should be uploaded to the remote folder.",mozilla,again,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-04-15,4,28,2009-04-15,851,critical,5

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

The Image Properties Window does not tell what type of image it is.  This can be
a problem when checking the images on bugzilla.

For example:
Go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view
Right click on the image and select properties.
Using the properties window there is no valid way to determine what type of
image it is (aka gif png bmp etc...)  You will notice the location field has
the value http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view 
Because of this you cannot determine the type from the URL of the image.

Thus for cases like this either an Image Type: or a Type: or a File Type
field would be useful to indicate what type of image it is.

----------------------
Here's one suggested layout of where to place the new field:

Location:
Width:
Height:
Size of File:
File Type:
Alternatate text:

---------------------
A suggested formatting of the File Type value could be as follows (note it is
similar to the Size of File field).

EXTENSION (Description)
GIF (Graphics Interlaced Format)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
BMP (Bitmap)
JPGJPEG (Joint Photographic ? Group?)

CORE-56713,2000-10-15,XUL,CORE,Bulletproof common crash in [@ nsXULDocument::ResumeWalk],"Talkback is reporting a common crash for this stack trace in current builds. 
(I don't have any steps to reproduce this but some comments indicate that 
this is happening on startup):

5130        rv = element->AppendChildTo(child PR_FALSE)   <-- Boom!
5131        if (NS_FAILED(rv)) return rv
5132 

On bug 35568 Seth proposed a simple bulletproofing fix to assert and
bail out 'if (!element)'. We could probably do the same fix for this 
crash.

BUGZILLA-13534,1999-09-09,Administration,BUGZILLA,REMIND and LATER considered harmful.,"I think that we should endeavour to remove REMIND and LATER from Bugzilla.  I
believe that they achieve more harm than good.

There are many disadvantages:

(a) They can easily not appear as queries.  After all they are _unresolved_.
(b) Effort to reopen resulting in comments/activity which clutter the bug
report.
(c) They are usually set by Netscape employees and hence imply Netscape's agenda
for what will go in.  Mozilla at least is a open project where anyone can
contribute.

So what's the alternative?  The obvious answer is the milestone.

Remind can already be handled by moving the bugs to a later milestone where
they need to get reevaluated.  Remind could even get turned into a bug flag
(see bug #11155).

For LATER there needs to be an No Target milestone.  This means that there is
currently no plan for implementation but it has been considered and hence
won't appear on groups' new bugs radar (ie having a blank milestone which might
be renamed to To Be Considered).

This would require a little modification of queries by Netscape employees to
exclude untargetted bug reports but they generally know how to use Bugzilla.
It is a lot more important that Bugzilla newbies can quickly find the issues
that do not have a target date and they should help out on and point (a) can
prevent this.  This combined with the introduction of assigning to
nobody@mozilla.org covers all the issues that I know of.

Note that this works just as well for closed or in-house projects that use

CORE-38378,2000-05-06,CSS Parsing and Computation,CORE,Style system should not reresolve for every attribute change,"First some background as provided to me by the ever-helpful attinasi:

CSSFrameConstructor::AttributeChanged is called. This is were the
restyling happens. First the content object is asked what the impact of
the change is (given an attribute and a value). It can indicate a
RECONSTRUCTION a REFRAME or a simple VISUAL change.

For RECONSTRUCT the entire document is torn down and rebuilt. Pretty
harsh.

For a REFRAME a new frame is created for the affected content and
normal frame-construction / style resolution takes place.

For a VISUAL change we ask the FrameManager to compute the style change
impact. This walks up the frames getting the style contexts from them
and re-resolves the style on each one. ReResolve style runs through all
of the style rules for the content and any pseudo-style associated with
it and sets the new style values. As it goes it checks if the style
context actually changes and if it does it appends the new context to a
list of changes. It also keeps track of the kinds of changes that are
made indicating if there needs to be a reflow a reframe or just a
repaint. Depending on the results of the resolutions we then either
reconstruct the frames issue a reflow or update (paint) the views.

(End of attinasi missive.)

So this means that the _best_ case scenario for an attribute change is that we
walk every frame in the document and reresolve the style on each one.  Then we
decide what to do with it and in the best case again we do nothing (or issue a
paint I guess).

As an example of why I really want to fix this behaviour scrolling a GFX
scrollbar sets the ``curpos'' attribute lots.  Like lots and lots.

So I hacked up a patch which I will attach below.  It keeps a list on each
style sheet of each attribute that actually appears in a selector and then
checks against that table when an attribute changes.  Only if that attribute can
affect style context do we do the re-resolve dance.

With this patch I spit out a - for each style reresolution that I manage to
skip and a + for each one that has to happen anyway (no attribute involved in
the reresolution or attribute that mattered).  I scrolled the checkin-rules
page down and then back up and got the following:

------------++++++++++--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------++-

So damn.  It looks like we can win pretty huge here.

But of course it's not quite that easy.  I'm apparently causing not _quite_
enough action in the layout engine at times because some needed updates aren't
happening.  As an example while the document scrolls the scroll thumb doesn't
move.  And image rollovers as found on my old nemesis http://www.honda.com/ 
don't work.

Maybe I need to fire a paint at the minimum.  Maybe I'm blocking reresolutions
too aggressively and need to be more careful that I only block the ones that
are directly from the AttributeChanged notification and not from other paths
through that code.  I'm not sure yet but I wanted to throw this out for people
to poke at while I ponder.

(I think the patch will build but some files did get touched lightly when I
updated before the diff and there are some other -- unrelated I think --
changes in my layout tree.  No warranty express or implied.)",shaver,shaver,fixed,1,resolved,4,2005-02-14,0,36,2000-05-19,13,major,4

still active)

CORE-307533,2005-09-08,Layout: Text and Fonts,CORE,[FIX] Caret drawn at incorrect position after typing a single LTR character in a blank RTL input field (or vice versa) while caret is visible,"Steps to reproduce:
1. Place the caret in a blank RTL input field or textarea
2. While the caret is visible (i.e. during the on half of the caret blink
cycle) type a single LTR (English) character.
3. The caret will appear to the left of the typed character instead of to its
right.
4. Deleting this character will now require two presses of backspace.

The same happens when typing a single RTL (Hebrew) character into a blank LTR
input field or textarea.
This does not happen if the character is typed while the caret is not visible

Nothing clips Cocoa plugins to their bounds. In fact our test plugin draws outside its bounds (the stroke is centered on the border box edge).

the titles of the other themes on that page. This is incorrect - such pages do
not have a base or basic theme/style to speak of. Moreover selecting 'Basic
Theme' does what 'No Theme' usually does - completely strips all styling from
the page whereas on pages with both 'No Theme' and 'Basic Theme' the latter
just strips the styling of the alternate stylesheets but not that of the
untitled base theme.

object that can be permanently cached. Retrieving a really large object
forces other objects out of the cache which may not be reasonable
particularly for users on a slow link. For example I often visit sites
which have the same image in various sizes. There is a small browse
version and a hi-res version. You view the browse version and download
the hi-res version if it's interesting. The hi-res version is often a
4MB jpeg or even a 40MB tiff and it is _not_ meant for viewing in a
browser. It is irritating to see mozilla flush almost everything else in 
its cache just to accommodate these beasts.

For symmetry there probably should also be a minimum size limit. I can 
imagine a user on a fast network retrieving small objects from a proxy 
server or something without storing them in mozilla's disk cache.

If it were me I would set a maximum size of 4MB and a minimum size of 0.

signed KMail test email #1

This can be reproduced with the mail/news client in Thunderbird and in
Seamonkey trunk and recent releases.

I received a signed email from a KMail user.  His message had an attribute
of type PKCS #9 S/MIME Capabilities from which we create an S/MIME profile.
It said that his client prefers 3DES and AES.  RC2-40 was not even listed
among the ciphers his client supports.

Then I sent him an encrypted reply.  My reply was encrypted with RC2-40.
That's wrong.

Something failed but it's difficult to say exactly what.
Did we fail to generate an S/MIME profile from the received signed message?
Did we not find the S/MIME profile when we went to encrypt the reply?
Was the failure in PSM? or in NSS? or ?  

I will attach two such signed emails I received with which the problem
can be reproduced. 

The signed message contained these signed attributes:

CORE-278885,2005-01-18,Networking: HTTP,CORE,cache access denied from (ntlm) proxy on websites that require basic authentication,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 de-DE rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050118 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 de-DE rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050118 Firefox/1.0

In most cases I got directly a 301 after requesting a page secured by basic
authentication. I have been relocated to something like
www.example-domain.com/secure_area/ (from: www.example-domain.com/secure_area -
the slash was missing). Firefox sent a new request which was followed by a 407
from my proxy server. My proxy server offered me ntlm authentication and basic
authentication. Firefox chose ntlm and authenticated transparently. After that I
got a 401 - the webserver only offered basic authentication. Therefore Firefox
chose basic authentication. I entered the correct username and password and a
popup occured telling me to authenticate against my proxy server.

The first problem was that Firefox chose to use basic authentication to
authenticate against the proxy server because it had used it before to
authenticate against the webserver. I've made a change in
nsHttpChannel::GetCredentials that avoids that this selection is performed for
proxy authentication.
I think this change does not break anything because we can only use one proxy
(that requires authentication) anyways and it should not hurt anyone when we
choose the first authentication scheme that we support to authenticate against a
proxy server - just as in all the other requests.
After I had changed this behaviour it worked when requesting
www.example-domain.com/secure_area/ directly (not when requesting
www.example-domain.com/secure_area).

The second problem was that Firefox automatically sent the ntlm type 3 message
when requesting the secured page with basic credentials. It seems as it simply
takes it from the last request. Therefore I added a little check to
nsHttpChannel::ProccessAuthentication to ensure that this message would not be
sent before it has been requested. The ntlm authentication starts again and
everything works fine now.

I'm not very familiar with the mozilla code but I hope that this patch
nevertheless fits into the design of the mozilla code.

I know about https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211843 but because of
the date of the last message and because I'm posting a potential patch I thought
it would be no mistake to create a new bug report. In this bug report a similar
- but not identical - situation is described.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup proxy server (I use squid) offering ntlm and basic authentication.
2. Browse website that requires basic authentication.

Actual Results:  
A popup will occur telling you to authenticate against your proxy server
although you have authenticated already using the ntlm authentication method.

Expected Results:  
After entering correct username and password for the basic authentication on the
requested website the secured content should appear.",darin.moz,jr,fixed,1,resolved,4,2018-08-31,0,20,2005-05-15,117,major,4

deskmod.org is down - or at least has only a very limited service. For the
reasons see http://www.deskmod.com/?show=news&nid=1942.

When a user hits View -> Apply Theme -> Get New Themes s/he is redirected to
http://mozilla.org/themes/download/ where deskmod.org is mentioned first. This
could lead to the wrong assumption that there are no mozilla themes anymore.
The link should be removed as long as deskmod.org is down (which seems to be
several months).

The HTTP ACCEPT header is not preserved when after a GET redirect. That leads that the second GET is not using the original HTTP ACCEPT header but is reset to the standard.

This is a really important feature for the proper implementation of RESTful architectures. I'm currently developing some RESTful prototypes and this feature is a must when dealing with aliasing of resources for instance in order to access resources by their ID or any other resource key field (as its unique name). The problem is that the http accept header in particular is very important to determine the proper format to de-reference to the resource to (as when using Ruby on Rails respond_to in order to determine the content-type to respond with).

TOOLKIT-59687,2000-11-09,Form Manager,TOOLKIT,Wallet should use displayble text to determine meaning of fields,"THE WAY IT IS
-------------

Currently wallet tries to identify the meaning of a field by examining the value 
of the name attribute of the html input tag.  Sometime a website uses meaningful 
names (like zipcode) which makes this job simple.  But more often than not 
they use cryptic names (like 3.0.3.27.1.1.31.11.16.9.11 -- yes that's what is 
actually found on the apple site for the zipcode field).

So wallet uses a table that contains URL-specific mappings for determining the 
meaning of field names used on specific websites.  That table has to be quite 
large in order to support a large number of websites.  But no matter how large 
it is there will still be many websites that would not be supported.

Furthermore the table is hosted on a server and pinged at the beginning of 
every browser session to see if it has changed and needs to be redownloaded.  
This also requires a procedure for maintaining the table on the server and to 
date none has been put in place.  And it requires a lot of specialized code in 
the browser to do the downloading in background mode.

THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
--------------------

Rather than using the name attribute of the input tag wallet could use the 
displayable text preceding the input tag.  That's much more meaningful because 
it has to mean something to the user who is viewing it.  This would allow the 
entire mechanism for dealing involving URL-specific mappings to be discarded.  
Significant reduction in the amount of data actually stored in memory.  And no 
longer any need to do dynamic updates for a server site.",morse,morse,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,24,2003-12-19,1135,normal,2

I'm writing a Makefile for a sample javascript XPCOM module (that I don't want
to be installed by default) and finding that rules.mk has doesn't do a good job
of following the NO_DIST_INSTALL flag.  Here's my Makefile:

 DEPTH		= ../../../../..
 topsrcdir	= @top_srcdir@
 srcdir		= @srcdir@
 VPATH		= @srcdir@

 NO_INSTALL=true
 NO_DIST_INSTALL=true

 MODULE=GenericModule

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 XPIDLSRCS = \
	 nsGenericModule.idl \
	 $(NULL)

 EXTRA_COMPONENTS = \
	 nsGenericModule.js \
	$(NULL)

 include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk

And here's what I see when I make:

 root@first:/usr/local/src/phoenix/mozilla/js/src/xpconnect/loader/sample# make

Since the Makefile explicitly says NO_DIST_INSTALL nothing should be

Well getAllLogins() will throw if it triggers a master password prompt and the
user clicks cancels. That's probably something that should be caught and
ignored.

It would be quite useful if ScriptableObject implemented at least a minimal version of the Map interface - containsKey get put remove at a minimum but also perhaps a read-only version of the various set views of the object.  This would allow accessing a NativeObject much more cleanly than having to know about the Scriptable Interface etc and it could be accessed by the many classes that already can deal with java Maps.  In terms of general behaviour this is much more useful than having ScriptableObject be implemented in terms of a HashMap and should not cause any performance degredation.

Draft patch requiring feedback for further progress:

- js_FunctionClass doesn't have any JSSLOT_* values which is odd
  because it has JSCLASS_IS_PRIVATE|JSCLASS_HAS_RESERVED_SLOTS(2).  Is this
  an XPConnect thing?  I see this comment:

    /*
     * Reserve two slots in all function objects for XPConnect.  Note that
     * this does not bloat every instance only those on which reserved slots
     * are set and those on which ad-hoc properties are defined.
     */ 
    JS_FRIEND_DATA(JSClass) js_FunctionClass = { 

- The following function names are based on the equivalent functions for
  Arrays.  Better names should be used but I don't know what they are because
  I'm still not sure what the dslots hold for Function and Call objects.

  getFunctionCapacity()
  addressOfFunctionElement()
  setFunctionElement()
  getFunctionElements() // are the elements upvars?  what are upvars?

  getCallCapacity()
  getCallElements()     // getCallArgsAndVars()?

- For js_ArgumentsClass we have getters/setters with names like
  getArgsLength().  I wonder if that should become getArgumentsLength().  The
  rationale would be that we use the full Arguments when talking about the
  Arguments object (eg. getCallArguments()) and the shorter Args for
  non-Arguments arguments (eg. getCallArgsAndVars() if we go with that name).",n.nethercote,n.nethercote,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-07-27,0,4,2011-07-27,448,normal,2

As per the SVG Spec you must be able to copy text in an SVG (for accessibility among other reasons). In MozSVG's implementation you cannot copy text. This may be a function of the inability to select text or search for text or it may not.

Note that this is different than the ability to select text or the abilty to find text using the search facility for which I will file separate bugs.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load sample file
2. Try to search for a string that appears in both HTML and SVG and cycle to an SVG instance of the matching string
3. If seemingly successful attempt to copy

Text string is not copied to the clipboard.

Since one of the latest Lightning updates (I think it was 1.3) I noticed that alarm popups very often appear to late. With Lightning 1.4 the new now indicator (the red bar) was new so now I see why the alarms appeared too late: the time that Lightning keeps internally often lags behind the real time.

A specialty of my setup may be that I am using it on a Laptop that I frequently suspend. After waking up I see that the software clock of the system is correct while it takes Lightning at least a few minutes (sometimes half an hour) to notice that it was wrong. Just now I woke the laptop up in the morning the system time clock showed 09:22:32 (Wed 23 May 2012) but Lightning's red line was at ~22:45 on Wed 23 May.

While I am typing this I set up a test event at 09:42 with an alarm 0 minutes before. It is now 09:46:00 and the alarm still hasn't shown up and the red indicator is still a bit above the alarm.

where the parenthesization means that the rewriting does not make a block but does make a group of sequential statements in the AST.

One such example is when you try to close a multi-tab Firefox window. You get asked whether you want to close all the open tabs and the question mark in that question is the english one.

Search Messages Window should remember size & Position

The default size of the Search Messages window is too small. Therefore I
always increase its size (height & width). It is very annoying to have to do
this every time. Therefore Mozilla should remember the size & position the user
chose.

RELATED: The separator between the search criteria and the search results below
should remember where the user last placed it. Most of the time the user will
want one or max two search criteria and the default (and remembered) position
should respect this logic - i.e. the bar should be much higher than it is now.

ALMOST RELATED: The position of the separator in the address book should also be
remembered across sessions. The current default is very bad (too high) since the
user will usually want to see as many addresses as possible. Therefore the
default should be much lower and it should remember where the user last put it.",Stefan.Borggraefe,Peter,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,2,21,2003-09-25,744,normal,2

  } finally {

)

Looking in to this my best guess (I wish I could provide insight that was more certain than a guess...) is that following the call to .close() done in the pipe() method the errProcess stream gets cleaned up and its underlying file descriptor is destroyed thus this exception on this later (second) call to close().

If this call to errProcess.close() is commented out the same exception would occur but via the call to in.close() on line 744: (

  pipe(false in inProcess)
  in.close()

)

I suspect (though didn't actually encounter) this exception could also happen on line 769's call to outProcess.close().

Steps to Reproduce:

    print(\nB -  + i)

Actual Results:  
IOException (Bad file descriptor) would occur around the 30th iteration of the loop. (Sometimes the exception would not occur until after several hundred iterations though.)

Build Identifier: 0.8.0.3

Discovered the bug when trying to develop an xform (main form) to edit another xform (instance form).  

I have a repeat element in the main form that lists the existing model elements and controls in the instance form.  I have created an instance of xform model and control elements to use as templates (controls instance).  Using the xforms insert element with the origin attribute bound to a node in the controls instance I should be able to insert a new xforms model or control element. 

Problem 1: With an xforms:instance element in the controls instance the main form will not load.  The xforms extension appears to be trying to load the xform:instance element even though it is only supposed to be an xml template.  It also tries to load the xforms:instance elements in the instance form.

Problem 2: Taking out the xforms:instance elements in both the form and the controls instances or associating them with a different namespace the form will load. Clicking on the trigger to execute the insert action to insert a control (e.g. input) from the controls instance has no effect.  Tested in Orbeon xforms sandbox it does properly insert the control from the controls instance so it appears that the code is correct.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple xform
2. Create another xform that loads the first xform as an instance and has a repeat to list the controls in the instance xform
3. Create a another instance with a few xforms controls to be used as templates.
4. Add a trigger to the main form to insert an xform control from the controls instance into the xform instance (using origin bound to a node in the controls instance)
5. load the form and click on the trigger.  Nothing will happen. 
Actual Results:  
Clicking a trigger to insert and xforms control from a template instance into a form instance should insert the control.

Normally between each sequence of calls into sydney_audio that results in data being written (sa_stream_get_position/get_write_size/write) there are 0-5 such sequences that write no data.  I'm calling this polling though I don't know what purpose these calls serve (if any).

In a completely random and erratic manner this polling activity goes haywire.  Suddenly there will be anywhere from 700 to over 30000 of these polling sequences between non-zero-byte writes.  For a CD-quality http stream there are typically 14-18000  for a low-quality stream there may be 23-30000.  This behavior may occur only once every 20-50 writes or in spates of 5-10 occurrences or it may become continuous.  When this occurs at length it consumes 100% of the CPU's cycles and renders the machine nearly unusable.

This polling is definitely not the result of waiting for a buffer to become free.  In my OS/2 implementation there are usually 5 16k buffers available & 6 in use.  Though I haven't tested versions for other platforms I don't believe this is an OS/2 issue since the code that generates these calls is (all?) cross-platform.",dragtext,dragtext,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-10-21,0,12,2009-07-22,55,normal,2

The Usage message needs to 
- document EVERY option known to signtool
- separate the command options (which specify the operation to be performed)
  from the modifier options that merely supply file names or info about 
  variants on how to perform the operation.
- document which options are required for each operation e.g. cert nickname
  is likely required for signing but not for JAR signature verification.

The usage message should not cite urls from netscape.com any longer.

After reading the usage message the reader should easily be able to 
- list the operations that the tool can perform
- know which options are required for each of those operations.  

The existing usage message states that every command requires a positional
parameter which is a directory-tree but the -v and -w commands take an
an argument that is a jar file name not a directory tree name.  So that
usage summary is wrong.  

If there are any commands that can operate from EITHER a jar file or a 
directory tree (or both) as input this needs to be documented in the usage
somehow along with how to specify one or the other and which is default.  

Likewise for output.  Some commands produce a JAR file as output.  They
may also leave a (modified) directory tree as output.  The production of 
the output JAR file may be optional.  The Usage needs to make this clear. 

Finally I will add that after reading the usage the reader should be able
to answer the question of which command cause any JAR file contents to be 
uncompressed and extracted.",biswatosh2001,nelson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2007-11-05,0,24,2007-11-05,840,normal,2

In a recent build a fix was put into place that would simulate a double-click when user right-clicked on a word in order to have the spell check function correctly.

The problem with this is that if you try and select a portion of text and then right click somewhere within it in order to copy the selection it will unselect the selection and select just the word you right click on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a line of text in a text field.
2. Right click on part of it.
Actual Results:  
Your selection is replaced with a selection of just the word you right-clicked.

Expected Results:  
Brought up a normal contextual menu while keeping your original selection intact.

different calender files (business private holidays...) had been used in the
former installation (about 200406xx - don't really remember but the problem had
been the same in the change to that version somme month earlier).

I changed to the above named new version of sunbird (by extracting zip file to a
new directory).
After starting sunbird only one (the standard calender has been reachable).
It's a not really short way to get the others back to use (see below).



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.have an existing sunbird with calenders in use.
2.end that programm
3.extract the zip file with the actual version
4. start the new program
5. see only one calender
Actual Results:  
adding new calendars with pointing to exact the old existing calendar files will
result in overwriting them with a new file without any events.

Work around: save the old files. create new ones in the above way. end sunbird.
replace the files by your backups. restart sunbird and finally enjoy.

When adding an RSS feed via Subscribe to feeds dialog Thunderbird tries to
verify the feed fails because the link is not available and does not add the
feed to feeds list.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an RSS account
2. Click Subscribe to feeds
3. Click Add try to add http://www.mozillazine.org/atom.xml
Actual Results:

Expected Results:

the feed should be verified when it's first checked for items?)

This doesn't work neither when TB thinks it is online but there's no connection
nor when TB is in offline state. It is very inconvenient to copy my feeds from
another RSS reader since I will have to be online just to add my feeds to the list.

Build Identifier: version 3 alpha 1 (20061211)

There are 16 possible column headers. By default Thunderbird displays 8 of them.

1. Threads
2. Starred
3. Attachments
4. Subject
5. Read
6. Sender
7. Junk Status
8. Date

The problem is that the column header information is wrong. For the default settings:

- The column count is reported to be 3 when it should be 8
- Only the following headers are reported: Subject Sender and Date. Note these are just the headers containing text. 

This is a serious problem because the column count is used to determine the row and column for the cell as a specified index.  Assistive technologies cannot determine which cells belong to each column and row. In particular Orca cannot speak the cells in a mail header row correctly because it cannot get the actual cells in a given row.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable assistive technologies on the desktop.
2. Start Thunderbird 3
3. Start at-poke and view the treetable containing the message headers. You will see that the column count is incorrect and the header list only contains headers with text.

Actual Results:  
See Details above.

Expected Results:

Additionally GetIsMainThread() uses an outparam+return code which may affect code generation.

For external code it is much more expensive since it needs to grab the thread manager service atomically addref it take the same steps as above then atomically unref.

We can make this more efficient by doing the following

  * Create the thread-local storage location |IsMainThreadTPI|
  * Set |IsMainThreadTPI| to true for the main thread when it first loads
  * For each subsequently created thread set |IsMainThreadTPI| to false when the thread is created

Build Identifier: 

nss_ckmdSessionObject_SetAttribute in security/nss/lib/ckfw/sessobj.c has an allocation which it does not scale by the size of the element type leading to a write overflow.  The relevant code is pasted below.

I don't know whether this is exploitable (I don't have much familiarity with the Firefox or NSS code and this was found with a code scanning tool).

BEGIN_CODE

  nssCKMDSessionObject *obj
...
  CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PTR rt
...

  rt = (CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PTR)nss_ZRealloc(obj->types (obj->n + 1))
  if( (CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PTR)NULL == rt ) {
...
  }

  obj->attributes = ra
  obj->types = rt
  obj->attributes[obj->n] = n
  obj->types[obj->n] = attribute
  obj->n++

END CODE

The call to nss_ZRealloc allocates obj->n+1 bytes instead of (obj->n+1)*sizeof(CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE) bytes (CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE is an unsigned long) so the write to obj->types[obj->n] will overflow as well as future reads and writes of obj->types.

After restarting the folder appears again but when I try to delete it nothing
happens and if I look in my profile directory the folder is represented in
/Mail/Local Folders/ by an empty directory rather than an mbox file.

The problem doesn't occur if I delete the folder and then attempt to recreate it
without restarting.  It's as if the deletion isn't getting written to the
datastore (panacea.dat?) so all record of the deletion is lost once the app is
shut down causing the app to think the folder still exists upon restart which
causes the mbox file to get created incorrectly when requested.

TESTCASE: Recursive embedding

I was playing around with Gran Paradiso 3.0a6rc2 and discovered a something
about how Firefox deals with embedding that related to this bug:

You can typically only have 2 levels of embedding (ie. an iframe in an iframe).
 This seems to be the case with   and .  However if
you have an  that points to the original document and has a 1px border
Firefox will get caught in a recursive loop and bloat until the user decides to
force quit or the system can no longer take the load.

Here is the offending tag that causes the recursion assuming the containing
document is called index.html:


The results I experienced on my system were that firefox took 50% of my cpu
usage (100% of 1 core) and bloated to 350MB after about 30 minutes of watching
task manager before I got bored and forced quit.  Firefox probably would have
been more than happy to munch away at more of my ram had I not stopped it.

Note:  This only affects Firefox 3.0-based builds as far as I can tell. 
Firefox 2.0.0.4 only allows for a single level of recursion (ie. one layer of
embedding within the parent layer of embedding).  I saw this on both GP 3.0a6
rc2 and the latest nightly trunk from June 29 2007.

I have attached a test case that simulates what I saw.  The test case cannot be run through bugzilla.  It must be saved and run locally.  Alternatively you can copy the following code into an empty file called testcase.html and run it that way.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I was writing an extension that has a periodic and I wanted to have the option to change the interval at which it runs.

To do this I created a NsiTimer using the createInstance function and store the object as a global variable and used the init() function to start it with a type of TYPE_REPEATING_PRECISE.  When the user changes the interval at which the periodic should run I issue a cancel on the timer and then another init with the new interval value.  The problem is that any future calls to init will have the interval passed in that call added to the original interval from the first time the init was called.

So for example if I start the timer originally with a periodic of 5 minutes and the user changes it to 1 minute the timer will start running at 6 minutes.

I found a work around for this.  Basically after I issue the cancel I have to issue another createInstance call which will destroy the current timer and create a new one.  According to the documentation at http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsITimer.html this shouldn't be necessary since the cancel should clear out the timer.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create TYPE_REPEATING_PRECISE NsiTimer and initialize with an interval of X seconds.
2.  Cancel this timer and reinitialize with an interval of Y seconds.


Actual Results:  
Timer will now expire every X+Y seconds.

Expected Results:  
Timer should expire every Y seconds.

I wrote an extension which will create a timer of 5 seconds and then change it everytime it expires.  It logs the times it takes to expire and how long it should take in the javascript console.  It stops after 6 changes.

Notice that the new timer will always expire 5 seconds after it was set to because it adds in the original 5 seconds.  

To make it work correctly add the following line after the cancel in StartTimer():

The problem is that when I'm moving my mouse to click on another tab I'm aiming for anywhere on the tab and suddenly I click the tab before I realize that an [x] button has appeared and I end up closing the tab instead of switching to it.

Personally I don't really like having an [x] on every tab.. but I feel like if you're going to do that it should always be there and not just on the mouseover.  I'd rather see it have an [x] on the active tab and allow you to right-click other tabs to close them without switching to them.  But that's just my opinion.

SOCORRO-526046,2009-11-02,General,SOCORRO,SkipList Generate better signatures for crashes related to unhandled Obj-C exceptions,"Sam Stuart and I have been talking about the way Socorro/crash-stats is currently lumping together many unrelated crashes related to Obj-C exceptions and how to make the signatures for such crashes useful.

On 10.5/10.6 these exception-related crashes look like:

0 CoreFoundation        ___TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION___  	
1 libobjc.A.dylib       objc_exception_throw 	
2 CoreFoundation        -[NSException raise] 	
3              

Here frame 0 adds no value and should be ignored/skipped.  Frames 1 and 2 tell us the crash comes from an exception and we want to know that (exceptions can be thrown directly from objc_exception_throw and -[NSException raise] so we need to look for and prepend/compound both and can't ignore one).  Then we want Frame 3 which tells us what bit of code is causing the exception.

The desired signature from the above crash would look like

objc_exception_throw | -[NSException raise] | 

with possible variants (depending on how the particular exception flow happened)

objc_exception_throw | 

-[NSException raise] | 

On 10.4 these crashes look like:

0   	
1 Foundation    _NSRaiseError 	
2 Foundation    +[NSException raise:format:] 	
3      

Here Frame 0 is something that's likely to be ignored/skipped already (certain raw addresses) or something that we already make part of a compound signature/prepend (objc_msgSend).  Frame 1 doesn't tell us anything useful and can be skipped.  Frame 2 though tells us we're crashing from an exception (we want to know that) and we want that compounded with/prepended to Frame 3 which tells us what bit of code is causing the exception.

The desired signature from the above crash would look like

objc_msgSend | +[NSException raise:format:] | 

with possible variants (depending on what frame 0 was)

+[NSException raise:format:] | 

 | +[NSException raise:format:] | 

In summary when encountering these frames please

Skip/Ignore:
* ___TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION___
* _NSRaiseError

Prepend/Compound with following frame:
* objc_exception_throw

Subject: destructuring assignment bug?
Reply | Reply to author | Forward | Print | View thread | Show original | Report this message | Find messages by this author
Hi

I have stumbled across a behavior that doesn't seem correct in the CVS
version of Rhino. It seems that the presence of a destructuring
assignment in a let-block causes the other variables to lose their
bindings.

$ java -cp js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main -version 170
Rhino 1.7 release 1 2008 01 28
js> let(a = 1 [bc] = [23] d = 4) { [abcd] }
23
js>

As I am new to the Rhino codebase I'm expecting it will take me a
little while to generate a patch for this so if someone else also
wanted to take a look at it that would probably be helpful. I suppose
it's also possible that I simply misunderstand the specified behavior
and that there actually isn't a problem.

Cheers

CORE-197568,2003-03-15,XUL,CORE,Dialog box with multiline textbox closes when user hits Enter in textbox,"Given an XUL dialog box like this:



<dialog xmlns=http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul

the user cannot use the Enter or Return keys in the textbox.  This is because
the event handlers at the end of the binding file call _hitEnter() and the
_hitEnter() function doesn't bother to check for an  element.

The fix should be easy:
(1) Pass the event object from the handlers to the _hitEnter() method.
(2) Add an evt argument to the _hitEnter() function to receive the event object.
(3) Check for ((evt.target.tagName != textarea)&&(evt.target.namespaceURI !=

Advanced/General/Choose does not perform language tag matching in a case-insensitive manner: It does e.g. not match en-US (set via intl.accept_languages) to en-us (English/United States) instead it simly displays en-US without the explanatory (English/United States) text.

But language tags are case-insensitive -- and uppercase country subtags are actually preferred (FWIW: maybe you could follow this convention as well.)

if we are talking to a server that does not support custom flags (like courier)
 could we easily fall back & store junk flag status in the summary file?

David's answer on how we would do this:
 in the destination db record enough information about the msg hdrs that got
moved into it so that when we download the new headers we'd recognize them as
messages that need to have the flags set.  if you switch machines it'll fall
down...but it would work OK for most users. 

it should be easy enough to only do this when the server doesn't support user
defined keywords. We could probably just hash the headers and store the date
header and use those two to match",mozilla,mscott,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-01-22,0,10,2003-09-16,29,normal,2

Concept of how to map Chatzilla icons

Our current mailnews smileys (both mail display and mail composition) are rather out of sync with the general smoothness of our themes.
Furthermore they're 19x19 gifs which causes more problems:
- size breaks Mac Tiger menuitems (bug 483888)
- gif lacks some features png has (bug 199958)

We do otoh already ship a decent set of 16x16 png smileys as part of Chatzilla.

Thus I propose to just copy over the limited subset we do use in MailNews.

Unfortunately MailNews does not recognise most of Chatzilla's icons nor does Chatzilla recognise some of the MailNews' ones. The attached concept proposes how to map the known ones I could derive those missing from the existing Chatzilla ones if we agree on this path of action here (and I'd provide the actual CSS patch then).

But first we need to know for sure if the Chatzilla icons are MPLed thus requesting r? from James. Requesting ui-r? and sr? for the path of action real patch will follow after that. 
(BTW: I'd propose using a single image map for the smileys and using -moz-image-region if Mac menuitems understand that.)

(Sadly we can't do 'hg copy' anyway since Chatzilla is not in hg yet.)",neil,mnyromyr,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-07-15,0,15,2009-04-12,23,normal,2

patch in progress and I'm just going to stick it here and dup old bugs as necessary:

The standalone XPCOM glue does not work on mac because it uses PR_LoadLibrary
which only loads bundles not dylibs. This can be fixed by using NSAddImage. I
have code in my tree which does this currently and it correctly links to XPCOM
but then there are problems after I call NS_InitXPCOM2 with system calls
crashing (CFURLGetFileSystemRepresentation or something similar in the sequence
of calls at
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/xpcom/io/nsDirectoryService.cpp#202).

My GRE-finding strategy on mac is significantly different from unix and is
based on a plan to ship xulrunner/libxul as a framework: the GRE finder will
look in the following locations for compatible GREs:

some override environment variable for testing purposes
/Contents/Frameworks/XUL
(don't version-check this assuming that if it shipped with the app it's the
correct version)
~/Library/Frameworks/XUL/Versions/
/Library/Frameworks/XUL/Versions/

the app launches

For this specific project the folder is androidmarket/YOURLOCALECODE/ example for Czech:
https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/androidmarket/cs/

You will find in your locale folder a strings.php file with 3 php variables to translate ex:
http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/androidmarket/en-US/strings.php?revision=75801&view=co

There are limitations to the number of characters you can use:
$titleString : 30 characters
$description : 325 characters
$slogan : 80 characters

A small testing tool to check that what you submitted respect those length restrictions is located there (page updated from svn every 10mn):
http://l10n-misc.stage.mozilla.com/androidmarket/qa/

This is a short but rather urgent project since we want to submit Firefox Beta for mobile to the Android market place as soon as possible.

this block:
+#elif defined(NO_X11)
+    ?
is just a placeholder to remind people that there could be other things that aren't X11.

Though the approach taken there works it's not the ideal way to deal with this esp. as it results in extensions with the same ID but different content (due to different localizations).

In IRC and newsgroup discussions we seemed to get to an agreement that the best solution for the future is to go with leaving the core ChatZilla bundling en-US and have language packs for other locales which are marked dependent on the main ChatZilla package for those applications that can deal with extension dependency.
We also should get AMO to support such extension language packs and even offer compound ChatZilla+locale packages as so-called Multiple Item Packages for apps based on toolkit 1.8 and higher.

The target is to get a solution with this for SeaMonkey 2.0 locale repackaging and as a second goal also create XPIs that can be used for Add-On installation on all apps that ChatZilla supports. I'll try to work on those goals in this order.

1) JSD uses JS_SetNewScriptHook() and JS_SetDestroyScriptHook() to set its
own callbacks.

proposed patch

With Steven's patch for bug 428070 scrolling the testcase is
pretty good. However now Shark shows 
nsEventStateManager::ForceViewUpdate in the profile when scrolling
the page using mousewheel.
I think we could just remove the method.
I tested normal pages and also about:config and other xul:trees in the UI.
Seems like bryner added that method year 2000 to fix some xul:tree problems.
Unfortunately the commit message doesn't contain link to the bug.
I guess the relevant bug is bug 43710 (no patches there :( ).

With this change and bug 428070

I would like the option to publish a calendar without publishing their alarms.
This way if you share your calender and other people view it they will not get
any of the alarm popups. This is very usefull in a business enviroment where
people will occasionally need to chech eachother's calenders. This option would
also be a usefull workaround  bug 212076 (
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212076 ) that asks for alarm
acknowledgements everytime you refresh a remote calendar.

The fix

Looking at the review for bug 413260 I think it would help if we had at least some minimum tests for convertToBase64EncodedXML convertToXMLPrintData and convertToEscapedVCard.

The attached tests basically just take a fully-filled in nsIAbCard and checks the results for them.

Yes I did just copy and paste from what it currently does but I don't think that's too much of a problem. We can expand them later and think about standards then I'm just looking to get something in so that we can check we don't do major regressions.

Doing these functions also gives us the advantage is these functions should cover pretty much all the current properties that we use on ab cards.",standard8,standard8,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,10,2008-03-11,28,normal,2

$ obj~/js
js> evil=eval
function eval() {[native code]}
js> let (x=1) { print (evil(x)) }

The underlying problem is that while the 'if indirectCall' code does swap out the frame's scopeChain if there are lexical blocks on caller->blockChain the subsequent call to js_GetScopeChain re-clones them uses them for the compile and execute and then drops them when it restores the frame's original scopeChain.

These double clones never get their variables copied out of their stack frames when the frames are popped so you can get functions that have closed over blocks pointing to popped frames:

$ cat ~/mc/b/strict/eval-scope-2.js
evil=eval
var f g
let (x=1) {
  evil(f=function () { return x })
  x++
}

The SVG Performance of Firefox 3.5 is pretty slow. The XHTML document on http://warsimulator.appspot.com/static/warsim.xhtml
is running quite good on Firefox 3.0.11 Safari 4 and Opera 10b. However the performance on 3.5 is reduced dramatically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://warsimulator.appspot.com/static/warsim.xhtml 
2. Hover over the cells. The cell you are hovering over will be highlighted.
3. Click on a cell to select it and play around with the orange buttons on the top right. They will change the height and the terrain (The buttons on the top left don't have any function yet).
Actual Results:  
When hovering over the cells the window sometimes stalls for a few second.
When clicking the top left buttons it takes significant time to update the view.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a request for enhancement.

When editing mail in Message Composer/Editor (especially when reformatting the quoted text) it is very convenient to have a keyboard hotkeys to delete text word by word (to the left or right from cursor) to delete to the beginning/end of the line and to delete the entire current line.

Unfortunately Thunderbird does not support such a hotkeys. Can I ask you to consider implementing this feature?

    operator--() { --mValue }

then I change the NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS to declare nsAutoRefCnt instead of nsrefcnt.

This makes sure that both the initialization happens and that it happens in the

It doesn't remember what encoding the page loaded had (UTF-8) and therefore just encodes it as ISO-8859-1 or something like this. It should remember the encoding.

v1 + mixed content tests reenable

This is cause for mixed content tests (bug 452401) intermittent failures.

nsDocLoader maps request info by request (nsIRequest) address in its mRequestInfoHash hash table. When a request address get recycled and reused for another request (not unlikely to happen) existing info for already dead request is reused.

In nsDocLoader::OnProgress there is a condition 'if (!info->mUploading && (nsInt64(0) == info->mCurrentProgress) && (nsInt64(0) == info->mMaxProgress))' that have to pass only when we get the first OnProgress notify from a request (i.e. when progress of a request is 0) to prevent multiple StateChange notifications to upper levels. 

When existing request info is reused the condition doesn't pass even ones.

This OnProgress notification is critical for the security UI. When it doesn't get it for a request that request got ignored by security UI and we may occasionally get fully secure state for actual mixed content page.

Solution is to remove the request info from the hash table when we get OnStopRequest.",honzab.moz,honzab.moz,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-04-11,0,33,2009-04-08,39,major,4

them over again at every milestone release. We discussed these with Jim Dunn who 
was at IBM today and he suggested that we open this as beta1 problem for 
consideration for M14 even though it is not really beta1. We will attach 
diffs next week. 

Many of the changes to Makefile.in's are to:
- use 8.3 dll names
- override the override statements for shared libraries
- use $(BIN_SUFFIX) $(LIB_SUFFIX) for makefile targets as is done on Windows.

Changes to crossplatform code will be minor ifdef changes for OS/2. Most of the 
changes are to avoid Windows specific code which is included via ifdef XP_PC.

encode abc to cpp fix abc-encode verbose mode

I'm attaching a patch which provides a couple of enhancements to the abc encoding of ESC:

* A new tool which encodes a .abc file as .cpp/.h files as currently done by the ASC compiler suitable for generating the shell's toplevel.cpp/toplevel.h and ScreamingMonkey's equivalent.

* Fixes to make 'abcencode.sh verbose filename' work - it breaks because it throws away the constant pool values on reading them so 'verbose' can't access the values.

This has been done by:

* Creating a new file abc-parse.es which includes the parsing logic from abc.es and also the 'constant pool' parsing code of abc-encode.es.  This was done after Lars suggested the refactoring of the parsing code into a new module and so the .cpp encoder can reuse this pool parsing.

* Modifying abc-encode.es to use the shared constant-pool parser particularly in verbose mode.

* New source file and shell script for the .cpp encoder other tweaks to shell files to reference the new abc-parser.

Note the new .cpp encoder appears to work well and the output matches that of asc when run against the 2 toplevel .abc files in the source distro.  The order of the constants in the .h file do not match though but this is not a problem.",nobody,markh,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-02-21,0,4,2008-02-21,4,normal,2

CORE-411968,2008-01-11,JavaScript Engine,CORE,Finishing JS_AlreadyHasOwnProperty,"The new JS_AlreadyHasOwnProperty API (bug 400793) isn't finished: it isn't documented.  I'm working on that and I have a few questions.

* Why not call it JS_HasOwnProperty?  (I think we should.  We can still rename it it hasn't been in a release yet.)

* The implementation is quite different from the implementation of obj_hasOwnProperty (in jsobj.c).  Can some code be shared here?

* Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() handles inner/outer objects specially.  When searching for a property on an object x if the property is found on x's outer object the JSAPI says false the JS method says true.  Is that intentional?

* Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() also handles JSPROP_SHARED JSPROP_PERMANENT properties specially.   JS_AlreadyHasOwnProperty doesn't so it exposes an implementation detail about Function.length/arity.  Is that intentional?",jorendorff,jorendorff,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-02-08,0,7,2008-01-17,6,normal,2

I discovered this fiddling around with some of the form filling extensions. The form field length is reported as unknown by the extension. I typed in some nonsence then copy / pasted for about a minute. No end of field. I'm guessing it's 65000 in the database but the webpage itself needs a sanity check. Personally I can't see more than 1000 ever being necessary perhaps 500. Anyway currently a user could hose the page loading by submitting an insanely long comment. Note I didn't actually submit a comment like that so if there is a sanity check post form submit I apologize for the bug report in the first place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click any extension 'add your own comment' link
2. Fill in the form with trash over and over
3. Click Post if you want to REALLY annoy the moderators. )

Actual Results:  
Not tested but hung page load or rediculously long page

Expected Results:  
Decently long extension page

Most likely just needs a form field length on the actual page coding. I'm marking this security as I've seen other bugs marked severe for such form length issues.",morgamic,crogonint,fixed,1,resolved,4,2016-02-04,0,9,2006-01-27,46,critical,5

patch v.1

in the nsThebesDeviceContext  on windows we call GetDeviceCaps to figure out the DPI for the display.  On the htc this value is 360 (iirc it was ~360).  This caused the browser window to only fill about 1/4 of the screen.  We hard coded this value to be 96 and that seems to have worked for the most part however that caused the fennec canvas to not display:

Hello

while playing back media embedded within an  tag the playback performance on the WinXP machines I've tested on is choppy and unusable as is. My own experiments have shown that the performance is affected more when screen activity is busiest scrolling down a page for example and that some performance can be increased if the browser is minimised or a new blank tab is created and selected. Even then performance is frequently interrupted by disk activity.

This ticket is a continuation from this https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=462667#c13

For developers interested in this I can supply a URL to test against. It's not something I can make public for various reasons.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load up Firefox 3.{1|5}beta in a WindowsXP(32bit) environment
2. Navigate to a page using the  element and commence audio playback.
3. Try scrolling down the page moving the browser window. Notice choppiness.
Actual Results:  
audio playback is directly affected by screen draw actions. Even without any heavy screen drawing activity playback is prone to odd jumps interruptions. Other actions will also cause choppiness such as disk i/o

Expected Results:  
I expect the audio to playback without interruptions.
