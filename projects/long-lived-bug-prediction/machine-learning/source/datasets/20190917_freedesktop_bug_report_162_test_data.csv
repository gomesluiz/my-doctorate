Link is to a small sample clip (28mb 50sec hd-ready anime). This clip demonstrates the three 'types' of artifacts described above. 
In the first few seconds of the clip the video appears normal.
Then there is a flashback which starts out normal too but after a scene change there appear heavy blocking artifacts. It is hard to tell if only the color of the blocks if off or if (some of) the actual contents are wrong too. I'm inclined to say the former is the case (only the color is off).
After the flashback returns to the present time there is some mild blocking (especially evident when the woman turns her her head).

---- Reported by jku@linux.intel.com 2011-06-17 08:22:26 +0000 ----

NetworkManager 0.9 implements the same org.freedesktop.NetworkManager API but has completely changed the State property values.

NM <= 0.8:
 NM_STATE_UNKNOWN = 0
 NM_STATE_ASLEEP = 1
 NM_STATE_CONNECTING = 2
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED = 3
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTED = 4

NM == 0.9:
 NM_STATE_UNKNOWN = 0
 NM_STATE_ASLEEP = 10
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTED = 20
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTING = 30
 NM_STATE_CONNECTING = 40
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_LOCAL = 50
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_SITE = 60
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_GLOBAL = 70


I'll write a patch for setting the HTTP presence value to TRUE when NM state is [0 3 50 60 70]. That should cover it:  0 and 50 (link local connection) are probably not going to work but better to be conservative here.



---- Additional Comments From jku@linux.intel.com 2011-06-17 10:15:58 +0000 ----

I found another bug in the NM status code. Fixes are in jku branch -- do not merge the whole branch though it has work-in-progress webdav commits as well.

Let me know if you'd rather have patches or another branch...

    Specify interface name in NM DBus GetProperty call
    
    NetworkManager 0.9 is more strict about the call arguments: it seems
    newer dbus-glib requires that the interface name is specified otherwise
    there is an AccessDenied error.

    Update NetworkManager Status-handling to 0.9 API
    
    NetworkManager 0.9 changes the values of
    org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Status property. Fortunately the new
    and old values are not in conflict.
    
    Commit also starts setting presence to false only when we know this
    should happen (and not the other way around): It's better to fail
    this way than prevent user from syncing if things like this happen.

  * pop up a new ClientHandler head with a specific filter
  * Request the channel with the CLientHandler head as the preferred handler

In some cases this handler doesn't actually get the channel. From the looks of it this happend because MC starts dispatching the channel before it has finished introspecting the recently popped up handler which means that it's unaware of the specific filter and ignores the preferred handler.

Two potential solutions for this:
  * Always give it to the preferred handler even if its filter is unknown (or 
    even if it doesnt match?)
  * When dispatching a channel with a preferred handler block dispatching   
    until the preferred handler has been fully introspected",61,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-66145","Turning off 'Same content on first page' does not reflect in UI","Problem description: 
When creating a new document in LO (or opening an existing one) - if you go to the 'Page Style' configuration and go to the 'Header' tab and uncheck the 'Same content on first page' - you expect to be able to edit the first page's header different than other pages' headers. but in fact - they still edit together.
However when saving the file and reopening it - you see different headers. so this is a UI bug.

THIS IS A REGRESSION BUG (it worked in version 4.0).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Writer (new document)
2. Make sure you have 3 pages at least.
3. Turn off 'Same content for first page' in the 'Header' configuration.
4. Edit the header of the 1st page (it will show in other pages too - bug).
5. Edit the header of the 2nd\3rd page (it will show in the header of the first page too - bug).

Current behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the headers of all pages are still 'linked' and edit together.

Expected behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the header of the 1st page should be independent from the headers of the rest of the pages.

"XORG-9790","[modesetting] XVideo doesn't work because of double-wide mode","After a recent update to the head of the modesetting branch XVideo stopped working for me.  In the server log file I get an error:

Disabling XVideo output because Pipe A is in double-wide mode

(I'll attach a complete log file).

I checked the source and there's a code in i830_display.c with an accompanying comment that explains that the driver switches pipe from single- to double-wide mode (whatever they may be) if the dot clock is >90% of the core speed.

I'm using a 20 widescreen flatpanel with a resolution of 1680x1050 which needs 146.2 MHz dotclock.  It's connected to an I855GM-equipped laptop and the code assumes that the core speed is 133 MHz so obviously the code will trigger the double-wide mode case and disable XVideo.

However I've been running a version from the modesetting branch that I checked out in September 2006 and that version *did* support XVideo in that mode.  I compared the source and the old version appears to have lacked the code to turn double-wide mode on.

So I commented out in the latest version the code that turns double-wide on and tried (I'll attach the patch).  XVideo now appears to be working flawlessly for me.

I don't know if the code is broken or the docs are simply overly conservative or if I'm doing something that is not supposed to work but I just happen to be lucky.  If you decide that it's the last option I'd at least appreciate if you could add a driver option that allows one to override the automatically selected mode as obviously single-wide mode works for some people and being able to use hardware acceleration when watching movies sure is useful (that's what I bought the external monitor for :-).",18,"0"

This affects fonts like SIL Scheherazade and Lateef IranNastaliq and many of the newly developed Arabic OpenType fonts. One of the side effects is that all these fonts aren't used by Qt to render Arabic script (see Qt bug http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/task-tracker/index_html?id=127773&method=entry).

"DRI-101127","[HSW PWM] Brightness range not same as (correct) inverted brightness range.","A long time ago (I *think* around 4.8/4.9) I noticed that my usual PWM values no longer corresponded to the physical amount of light produced by my screen.
A value of 1/937 which used to be ultra-dim was quite bright.
The cause of this was never found (Various PWM/brightness related commits at that time reverted to no avail).

Today I decided to try and invert the brightness via 'invert_brightness' in sysfs and set the brightness to 936/937 - and there was the old ultra-dim brightness I have seen before at 1/937.

What I think is happening is that the PWM range is shifted up causing the lowest PWM value to correspond to ~40+ of the old correct range.
The highest PWM value seems to still clamp to 937 as that seems to be the hw limit.

This causes the whole PWM range to be incorrect not only disallowing low brightness values but also losing precision (Incorrect range is effectively lower than 1-937).

tldr: Normal 1/937 much brighter than inverted 936/937. The latter being the original correct brightness produced by 1/937.

    drm/i915: Broaden application of set-domain(GTT)

    Previously this was restricted to only operate on bound objects - to
    make pointer access through the GTT to the object coherent with writes
    to and from the GPU. A second usecase is drm_intel_bo_wait_rendering()
    which at present does not function unless the object also happens to
    be bound into the GGTT (on current systems that is becoming increasingly
    rare especially for the typical requests from mesa). A third usecase is
    a future patch wishing to extend the coverage of the GTT domain to
    include objects not bound into the GGTT but still in its coherent cache
    domain. For the latter pair of requests we need to operate on the
    object regardless of its bind state.

    v2: After discussion with Akash we came to the conclusion that the
    get-pages was required in order for accurate domain tracking in the
    corner cases (like the shrinker) and also useful for ensuring memory
    coherency with earlier cached CPU mmaps in case userspace uses exotic
    cache bypass (non-temporal) instructions.

    v3: Fix the inactive object check.

    v4: Rebase to latest drm-intel-nightly codebase

xset m 1/8 1
to disable mouse acceleration. The '1/8' could be tweaked to change the
mouse sensitivity under these non-accelerated conditions.

In the latest versions of the X server the code has been (significantly?)
cleaned up. Unfortunately the above no longer works properly. Try it the mouse
pointer will not move unless the mouse is moved very rapidly.

It would be nice if there was a (driver-independent?) way to set the mouse
sensitivity.

The old way was consistent in the sense that
(1) xset m 2 1
doubles the mouse speed but still disables acceleration and that
(2) xset m 1/8 1
decreases the mouse speed by some amount.

I have no idea how to re-implement the old model. The current code appears to
be correct it multiplies the mouse delta by 1/8 and for small movements the
mouse delta can be (1 1) (1/8)*(1 1) = (0 0) and so this results in no
pointer motion.

Can this be fixed so that even without acceleration one can use fractional
values like '1/8' to modify the mouse sensitivity?",187,"1"

libXpm is vulnerable to an out of boundary read if an XPM file contains
a color with a symbolic name but without any default color value.

A caller must set XpmColorSymbols and a color with a NULL name in
the supplied XpmAttributes to XpmReadFileToImage (or other functions of
this type) in order to trigger this issue.

The dmesg output

I have a NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT graphics card. I'm using Gentoo on a AMD64 machine with a custom built 3.5 kernel.

I've been using nouveau for more than a year by now without any kind of problems. Yet since I enabled the last kernel options I needed to get 3D hardware acceleration I'm having some issues.

When closing applications like web browsers or video players the X server suddenly hangs (I cannot even move the pointer) and after a few seconds it crashes and I see a TTY console. Then I think gdm tries to restart it and after a few seconds I have again some graphics on the screen which often is a corrupted image of what I was seeing before the crash. Then X crashes again gdm tries to restart it and so on.

When I'm on the TTYs I'm having some keyboard issues (keys double-typed or missed) but otherwise they work fine so I was able to log in and get some dmesg output and X logs which I'm attaching.

This issue only appears after I suspend and resume the PC. I can trigger this behavior almost at will after a resume but I'm not able to do it before. It also seems to be related to Xorg drivers and/or 3D since I didn't encounter it before activating hardware acceleration and it only affects the X server even after a restart while having no effect at all on TTYs.

The PDF page generated by evince

I downloaded a 2.8 MB PDF from http://www.firesifestes.com/Fires/F-Cirera-Sta-Col-Cervello.htm (no longer available from the site but I can sent it by email).  I opened the PDF in evince and saved one of the pages as a PDF.  I then used pdftops to convert the PDF page to a postscript page.  On the postscript page the text slants upward at about 45 degrees.  It seems like the WMode of the generated postscript font is wrong and the position after each character shifts both right and up.
To reproduce:
Open the 2.8 MB file in evince and print page 18 to a PDF file.
$ evince Festa-cirera.pdf
Check that the page is OK.
$ evince output.pdf
Convert the page to postscript using pdftops from either xpdf or poppler.
$ pdftops output.pdf output-pdftopsbug.ps
View the postscript page.
$ gv output-pdftopsbug.ps
I will attach the single page PDF and ps and screen captures.

"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-11686","Logitech Cordless Desktop EX110","Ok where to begin... I have the listed model:EX110 USB/PS2 keyboard/mouse combo.
It didn't do much except for the required keys except in windows. It has extra keys that the net is full of howto's some worked for me some didn't. To cut to the chase I have mine working now after way too much work on the subject. I am going to post a working set of setkeycodes=xxxx and keycode=xxx for this model.

I am sorry for this but I am using X 6.9 of a livecd installed to the hard disk.
Serge I did see the announcement you made for xkeyboard-config 1.0.
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2007-July/026318.html and I have downloaded it to compare inet files with. I see some updated keyboards in there.

This EX110 is a bargain basement keyb I picked up in a pinch but I like it more  than my M$ Bluetooth garbage. 

It has from the left side to the top going across to the right in this order:
(gray) Back Close then on the top:

4 Media player keys on the left side...
(gray) Play/Pause toggle Stop Previous Next.

Then going to the middle right side 6 more keys:
(gray) Audio Mute Vol- Vol+ Email Home Calculator

The 12 Function Keys...
Next it also has a Function Key mode button which does what a lot of other Logitech models do... gives the 12 function keys a new lease on life by sending yet new codes the kernel knows nothing about even when plugged in to the PS2 port. (On USB the 12 function keys were just not ever seen by the kernel.) 

I had to set the kernel message level to 8 before it would report in the syslog that keys were there but it didn't know what they were. Ctrl-Alt-SysReq then Ctrl-Alt-8. I put this here for the benefit of those who have a Linux put together by someone who thinks like my distro did and sets the loglevel too low for these messages to be recorded in the syslog.

They have pictures on them but they almost all map to some XFree86 symbolic name. There is no XF86Undo or XF86Redo defined in my XKeysymDB or something Close to Powerpoint so I used XF86Pictures in mine.

I defined a model in the needed files in /usr/X11/lib/X11/xkb/rules/ as logiex110. I have 12 new keys that I can assign to alot of things in KDE but not anything like Cut Copy Paste which KDE seems to want a combo keystroke for.
Possibly I can get better results using different setkeycodes commands.

For now I am just enjoying alot of new keys to assign functions to.

I used the Logitech Cordless Desktop as a starting point but it did the wrong thing for some buttons and there were some it had no mapping for. Home and Close I remember for sure. The F9~F12 keys are just labeled ABCD so I gave them Launch labels.

I know there are ways to include sections of keys Logitech definitions but what I don't know is if I use an include directive and then specify a new label for a key already defined then which one will win?

Is there an overrides directive in the compiler's building of the tables?

spreadsheet that will crash on filesave after modifying one cell content

Hello

OS : Windows Vista Pro 32bits + SP2
on 4.0.6.2 at work I switched to 4.1.3.2 (release) (through software removal and then installing the new version). I then had to go back to previous version because calc would systematically crash on filesave with certain files which is a blocker for me.

With the file attached (no confidential job data in it) I could reproduce the bug easily :
* I open the file with calc 4.1.3.2
* I enter a 1 in the J182 cell on the first sheet from the left (congés)
* I then try to save the file
* I see the progress bar and suddenly calc crashes.

This does not happen with v4.0.6.2.

I don't know if it can be related to bug #71847.

When entering cell data Shift-Backspace acts like Enter. As a result when
you're typing something such as Just saying HEMLLO the whole
contents of the cell disappear to only contain LLO. This is a very confusing
behavior especially since virtually all applications define Shift-Backspace as
equivalent to Backspace (including Excel word processors including OOo Writer
browsers like IE/Firefox/Chrome...). So the user is likely not even aware that
he's pressing Shift-Backspace instead of Backspace he just sees the contents of
the cell disappear spontaneously!

This issue is made worse on some international keyboards such as AZERTY (French)
because unless you have a numeric keypad they require you to use Shift to type
numbers. Since spreadsheets use a lot of numbers this bug is even more likely to
appear on these layouts.",62,"0"

"PKG-CONFIG-58363","`pkg-config --libs` should swallow -L/lib like it does with -L/usr/lib","This is coming from: http://bugs.gentoo.org/445796

I've noticed for a long time now that pkg-config doesn't print -L flags for system path(s) like /usr/lib with --libs argument

However it still prints -L/lib and doesn't act like it does for -L/usr/lib

Quoting Mike Frysinger from the downstream bug:

pkg-config should automatically skip it.  it has logic internally to do this for /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 and ...

Please read the downstream bug and you will notice this oddity is actually causing issues.

"SYSTEMD-49774","configure: error: pci.ids not found try --with-pci-ids-path=","I'm trying cross compile systemd with uclibc.
During configure systemd (current master) cannot find pci.ids.
Its a bit strange because it successfully finds usb.ids in same place.
Both pci.ids exists: /usr/share/misc/pci.ids and /usr/i686-pc-linux-uclibc/usr/share/misc/pci.ids

I use the `-usbdevice tablet` option to provide auto grab of the console on mouse-over.

This worked perfectly until I recently upgraded from evdev-2.6.0 to 2.7.0.  After the upgrade the mouse wheel stopped working.  Reverting evdev back to 2.6.0 fixes the problem.

Here is the Xorg log when running ok under evdev 2.6.0:

I'm experiencing a problem when playing videos using Xv output. The video rectangle overlaps everything on the screen. So if I try to put another window over the video or open a menu of the video player it appears behind the picture of the movie.

Unfortunately I can't attach a screenshot of the bug because accelerated video doesn't appear on the screenshot at all but if you really need it I can take a photo of my screen.

The problem reproduces independently of the window manager being used I've tried it with xfwm (both compositing and not compositing modes) and compiz. Also it doesn't depend on the video player (tried gstreamer-based and VLC).",408,"1"

This text is correct but it applies to LibreOffice also. In general this text refers to OpenOffice more than is should as it could deliver the same information referring to LibreOffice. The exact text at least should be amended to LibO.

The source code is

Usually I'd suggest add expression to return statement but for
this code I'd suggest changing the return type of the function
to void.

The attached test program adapted from the similarly named mesa demo is crashing on my Lenovo X1 Carbon with an Intel graphics card (3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller according to lshw) running Ubuntu 13.10.

The full session of compiling and running the program is below. The program crashes on uploading the 1x1 mipmap of a texture.

I'm aware that the texture data contains whatever garbage malloc returns but the full program where I stumbled on this bug exhibit the same crash with valid ETC2 data so I don't think the actual image data is relevant.

"POPPLER-7856","Transparent boxes are rendered opaque making text unreadable","The background of certain sections of a particular PDF appear white and since
the text is also white that results in the text being invisible. The text can be
made visible by highlighting the text in evince.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Download http://www.killernic.com/KillerNic/PDFs/KillerNic_TechSpecsHi.pdf
2. Open the downloaded file in evince .

Expected results:
The boxes behind the text should be transparent and the text readable. Stuntment

Actual results:
Large white squares over the PDF where some of the text is on both pages.
Increase in marketting cynicism.

Additional Information:
The PDF displayed correctly in acroread acroread-7.0.8-0.4 on OpenSUSE 10.1.

This was reproduced with libpoppler 0.5.3-0ubuntu6 and 0.5.1-0ubuntu7 with both

    egl_khr_fence_sync: Add sw_sync lib.
    
    Add a small library that helps manipulating software fences. They are
    useful for testing EGL Android fences since the latter can be created

SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug of systemd-networkd

Setting up a bridge with systemd-networkd does not works for me. I can not reach other hosts on the same network (i.e. ping the default gateway).
Doing things manually with iproute2 works fine.
The output of ip addr looks same in both cases.


-- br0.netdev --

Name=br0
Kind=bridge

Gateway=192.168.0.1
----

-- enp0s16.network --
[Match]
Name=enp0s16

[Network]
Bridge=br0
----

This is are the steps I am doing for the same thing that works:
----
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip addr add 192.168.0.77/24 broadcast + dev br0
ip link set dev enp0s16 master br0
ip link set dev br0 up
ip link set dev enp0s16 up
ip route add default via 192.168.0.1
----


In both cases the output of ip addr is:

----

and output of bridge fdb:

If after start networkd I set br0 to promisc executing ip
link set br0 promisc on network works fine but of course now br0
shows PROMISC under ip link.

I attach a example document in samplebigpdf.zip. It was fixed in Master PDF 3 (bookmarks added for navigation).

In sample file PDF viewers do not show bookmarks:
Chapter I > 1. Some Basic Items  lost Terms and Definitions

Chapter I >  2. Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers lost all from 2.10

Chapter II > 3. Conceptual Structure of System Z  lost all from 3.8

and more.

The Adobe PDF Reader Foxit Reader and PDF.js show all bookmarks.

want to scale an image with a hard edge but with filtering of its

I'm not sure there's really any way to get a FontFace& other than trickery (e.g. *font_face.operator->()) so I would guess that it's just never been used and we can break the API to do the right thing.

"XORG-666","New XKB option for Tux keys: request for addition","Submitted by Daniel Elstner:

---

Basically the bottom row of my keyboard (which is just a standard pc105
model with three replaced caps) now looks like this:

           

In order to make the keyboard work as advertised on the key caps I need
to map the keys as follows:

     = Super_L
     = Alt_R Meta_R
     = Super_R

So I did just that by putting another option into symbols/altwin:

// Layout for Tux key caps with additional right Alt key
partial modifier_keys 
xkb_symbols alt_super_win {
    key  {        [       Alt_L  Meta_L          ]       }
    key  {        [       Alt_R  Meta_R          ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_L                 ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_R                 ]       }
    modifier_map Mod1   { Alt_L Alt_R Meta_L Meta_R }
    modifier_map Mod4   { Super_L Super_R }
}

Obviously I also need put this line into rules/xfree86:

altwin:alt_super_win    =       +altwin(alt_super_win)
 
And finally there's the description entry in rules/xfree86.xml.  The
description was a little hard to keep short since this option actually
sets up two modifier mappings.  However I'm not sure if splitting it
into separate options would actually be useful.  (This would require
adding another option group too since in this one multiple selections
are disallowed.)  Anyway here's the text:


  altwin:alt_super_win
  Alt is mapped to the right Win-key and Super to Menu.

 
If you look at the patch you'll see that I also changed two other option
entries in the XML file.  Those referred to option names which did not
exist looks very much just like a copy-n-paste mistake.",478,"1"

System information and perf data

Hi
I have configured my system to use the amdgpu kernel driver (note no experimental support activated) on openSUSE Tumbleweed and running 4.8.0-rc2-3.gda13dfd-default. I did have to re-build the xf86-video-amdgpu to add my Mullins R5 PCI-IDs. I don't see this when running the radeon driver.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot to Gnome desktop.
2. Set timeout for screen saver 1-15 minutes doesn't matter.
3. From a remote ssh session monitor via top and observe one cpu at ~100% when screen save activates.

Actual Results:

"XORG-15512","[945GM] Incomplete DPI quirk causing large fonts","I'm forwarding this bug from a Ubuntu reporter.

Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/204065

The user is seeing font dpi's that are too large.  The monitor is being detected as one requiring a quirk for horizontal size in cm's and is indicating that it has set the DPI to (96 96) which *should* be fine.  However it later reports that it's using a 289 x 21 physical screen size so I wonder if it needs an additional quirk?

Xorg.0.log:  http://launchpadlibrarian.net/12888925/Xorg.0.log

[Original report]
Using Kubuntu Hardy Alpha 6 KDE4 edition. (same thing can be duplicated with the Ubuntu Hardy Alpha 6) on a Compaq V5204NR laptop. This machine has Intel 945GM graphics.

Attempting to boot in safe graphics mode boots into text mode only. Attempting to run startx does not work complaining that there are not usable screens for the display. Booting regularly does boot into X however the text is WAY oversized to the point that I cannot use any menu whatsoever. The numbers in the pager in the taskbar are at least 10 times too large they do not show fully in the pager. The tips box that starts up is so large that it fills the entire screen with only a few letters visible as they are also too large.

The only way i was able to get a usable screen was to boot into regular mode then drop to a virtual terminal. I mounted the laptop hard drive to a temporary folder then copied my existing xorg.conf to the right directory of the live cd. I then pressed ctrl+alt+F7 to go back into X and restarted the xorg server. I was then able to perform an install of the OS followed by an install of 915resolution.

While i know that 915resolution is needed for widescreen older versions (pre 7.10) would at least give me a proper 1024x768 with readable text.

I consider this a show stopper in that many laptops use the Intel graphics chipset. I cant be the only one with this issue. If i load a disk and i cant read ANYTHING on the screen or even see the menus to attempt to troubleshoot I am very unlikely to use the product. I dare say many would not think to keep a copy of a good xorg.conf file laying around... Seems that something just isnt right in the autodetection and setup of xorg.

"WAYLAND-82742","Touch doesn't work after calibration","Environment:
Embedded Linux Device
Resistive Touch Screen
Latest Weston/Wayland and Libinput

Summary:

Calibrated values are based on pixels and are used to compensate for differences in touch screens.

Libinput receives raw touch values. On an resistive touchscreen these are based on ADC values with a range (ex 0 - 4095). Libinput then uses the calibrated values to adjust the raw touch values. These adjusted values are then passed to Weston which eventually converts the adjusted values to actually screen coordinates/pixels. However when calculating the screen coordinates these adjusted values results in very large values (greater the screen dimension) or negative values to be returned. When Weston sends these coordinates values to the rest of the system no interaction with views can take place since the incorrect touch coordinates are beyond the screen thus no interaction can ever take place.

So before any raw values are adjusted via calibration they should first be converted to screen coordinates / pixels. This is how Weston without libinput handles things and touch works fine.

"XORG-4652","Xv + Silkenmouse = Lethal race condition","[From my mail to the xorg list slightly edited]

Silkenmouse means that the cursor update code (positioning view port panning)
is executed asynchronously ie it can interrupt on-going other operations of the
server.

xf86PointerMoved (pScrn->PointerMoved) is there to eventually pan the viewport.
So it is likely that pScrn->AdjustFrame is executed which is wrapped by Xv.

Xv's wrapper for AdjustFrame if the driver has not installed a
ReputImage function stops the video (by calling the driver's stopvideo
routine) and removes the port from the window (which is done in
RemovePortFromWindow()). This involves NULLifying the pointer to the
drawable in the Xv private structure.

However XVAdjustFrame does so only if the video is currently on
indicated by pPriv->IsOn == XV_ON. This is correct.

But what is not correct is that XvAdjustFrame() before calling
RemovePortFromWindow does not check if the pPriv->Draw is set.

So the condition under which XVAdjustFrame calls RemovePortFromWindow
is only that pPriv->IsOn = XV_ON.

PutImage on the other hand removes the port from the window every time
it is called. BUT: It does not set pPriv->IsOn to XV_OFF or XV_PENDING
(whatever would be correct haven't thought about this yet) at this point.

PutImage removes the port from the window (ie NULLifies the pointer to
the drawable) and proceeds doing its business without touching
pPriv->IsOn until the very end after the driver's PutImage() has been
called.

During the time between the RemovePortFromWindow() call and the near end
of PutImage the situation is that

- the portPriv->pDraw is NULL
- pPriv->isOn is eventually XV_ON from a previous call to PutImage().

If the silken mouse ie AdjustFrame interrupts PutImage during this
time it will see IsOn == XV_ON and therefore eventually call
RemovePortFromWindow with a NULL pDraw (= pWin). RemovePortFromWindow does no
NULL-check on its pWin argument so X gets a sig 11.

This discovery frightens me. Sure the easy way is to check for a NULL
pointer in XVAdjustFrame or - perhaps better - to add a pPriv->XV_xxx
after or before PutImage's call to RemovePortFromWindow. But this is
only a work-around for a more deeper problem.

Mildly put I am not sure that letting the driver's stopvideo()
interrupt an on-going PutImage() is safe in any case. 

An easy and quick fix would be inserting

    portPriv->IsOn = XV_OFF

before the call to xf86XVRemovePortFromWindow() in xf86XVPutImage. This
could also prevent a stopvideo interrupting an on-going Putimage(). But this
assumingly makes StopVideo choke and I am hardly convinced that this is a
long-term solution.

The long term solution is to make AdjustFrame be executed in the normal event
queue (as also Keith suggested). It does way too much nowadays to safely assume
it won't interphere with normal server operations.

I solved this by deferring AdjustFrame into the block handler in the sis driver
(not yet in CVS and won't in time for 6.9/7.0) but this really needs a global fix.",2185,"1"

Most  demo programs included in Mesa tree crash with segment violation when using nouveau driver with NV40 cards. The patch fixes most of the problems. The drivers for the the rest of the nvidia family seem to have this correct I hope this is the right place and the right format for the patch.

Xorg.0.log for 7.3/1.4.0

I upgraded from X.org 7.2 to X.org 7.3 after upgrading to FreeBSD 6.3. I even did a clean X.org reinstall by killing every X-related port there was and rebuilding them.

Whence before I didn't have to do gamma correction on my BenQ FP731 + Radeon X300 now in order to not be blinded when I'm in X I had to:

% xgamma
-> Red 0.450 Green 0.450 Blue 0.400

But it's still not right. I've reset the monitor to more or less its defaults (sRGB temp 40% contrast 30% brightness). But at these funny xgamma settings (aren't gamma supposed be > 1 if they really need adjusting?) my whites are still a bit too bright but the other colors are really too dark. And if I bump them up the colors never really fix themsevles but then everything gets all washed out and I get a headache :( It's as if the whites are too white and the blacks are too black and there's nothing I can do to get them to move from their respective extremes (because trying to lighten the colors makes the whites worse).

Note: using plain-jane DRI no AIGLX (see the logfile). Disabling Composite does not affect this problem. I've filed this under driver/radeon. Feel free to reassign.",0,"0"
"SYSTEMD-63277","journalctl -b doesn't do what is expected when there are explicit disjunctions","I expect -b to never output entries that don't belong to the current boot but when there are explicit disjunctions in the match expression it gets confused.

This is correct:

   # journalctl -b -o verbose | grep _BOOT_ID | sort | uniq
	_BOOT_ID=e2e2a996e7da4fb28d56f12a9c8a5261

(only one boot id)

but this isn't:

   # journalctl -b -o verbose _PID=2 + _PID=1 | grep _BOOT_ID | sort | uniq
	_BOOT_ID=1e128df28b734458a797870d84a806ee

	_BOOT_ID=e2e2a996e7da4fb28d56f12a9c8a5261

(many boot ids)

I guess this happens because -b just adds a single _BOOT_ID=... match which results in an effective match expression of 

  (_BOOT_ID=... && _PID=2) || (_PID=1)

in the last case.

To fix this the _BOOT_ID_... match needs to _also_ be added after each call to sd_journal_add_disjunction I think.  Patch with pleasure on request.",28,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-56015","Insane use of _PC_NAME_MAX","As described on the page at http://womble.decadent.org.uk/readdir_r-advisory.html (last modified in December 2007) OpenOffice.org (at least version 1.1.3) used _PC_NAME_MAX in an insane way (described in a slightly more colorful way in the aforementioned page). Looking at the current LibreOffice git master I see the insane code is still there on at least two different files (found with git grep _PC_NAME_MAX HEAD):

HEAD:extensions/source/plugin/unx/unxmgr.cxx:    char aBuffer[ sizeof( struct dirent ) + _PC_NAME_MAX +1 ]
HEAD:vcl/generic/fontmanager/fontmanager.cxx:    long aDirEntBuffer[ (sizeof(struct dirent)+_PC_NAME_MAX)+1 ]

vbios.rom

I have a GT216 [GeForce 210] (rev a2). I have two monitors one connected with DVI the other with VGA. In revisions after 415f12efc1b only the one connected to VGA will restore after suspend.

I need to apply
[ba5e01b0d0146c2d2bb5475cf1d6efec51bf2669] drm/nv50/disp: fix a potential oops in supervisor handling
to make it restore at all in 415f12efc1b..ba5e01b0d^. Otherwise the computer completely fails to resume. (The computer wakes up but is completely unresponsive. Both monitors are off. Pressing the keyboard makes the num-lock key blink once and nothing more. This is the same behaviour it has when the computer is suspended. The only difference is that the power light is not blinking.)

xrandr seems to think that the screen was restored properly.

If you run 

  sudo ./systemd-tmpfiles --create `pwd`/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf

in the built tree (which is probably the most convenient reproducer for developers) 3 times you get

I. e. the adm ACLs are repeated three times (notice that I left out the wheel ones as that group doesn't exist in Debian).

These duplicate entries not only pile up on persistant directories like /var over time they also break the setfacl command line tool which doesn't like them:

Copied from my Debian bug report at:

http://bugs.debian.org/655017

Package: xserver-xorg-video-intel
Version: 2:2.17.0+git20120104-1
Severity: normal

Dear Cyril dear maintainer(s)

After upgrading to 2:2.17.0+git20120101-1 I have refresh issues using the
driver with a composited KDE SC 4.7.4 desktop. Sometimes while typing the
window of the KDE application I am typing or parts of it will become black.
This quite frequently happens with KMail for example. But I have also seen
it with browsing the web also with Iceweasel.

If this happens when I move the mouse over the black areas they get
restored to their actual content. Sometimes the restauration happens
automatically. In any case when I disable and enable compositing
again everything is restored as well.

Ok I managed to produce an example screenshot. It happens quite
reproducably when I compose a new mail and then type something into
the subject line of the mail composer window of KMail. Funnily
as I continue typing the actual contents of the black areas appear
and go black again after a keystroke.

I think related it some short flickering to big black areas at times on
switching windows or activities.

I did not have this with the driver version before the version that enabled
SNA. I used the version with disabled SNA with 3.2-rc7 debian kernel as well
already. The most recent one from today (included in above Version: line)
also has this issue.

This all happens on a Lenovo ThinkPad T520 with Sandybridge graphics and
full HD laptop display.

We currently create it with 0755 permissions which is wrong. The spec clearly says If when attempting to write a file the destination directory is non-existant an attempt should be made to create it with permission 0700.

I'm wondering if we should fix the permissions for existing account. The spec mentions If the destination directory exists already the permissions should not be changed. but I'm afraid that many apps might be doing the same mistake so it might be worth just forcing this?

"DBUS-98666","clients that can't send messages to an activatable service should not be able to autostart it","This feature request was previously discussed in the thread started at . See there for background.

The tldr version is: suppose the XML policy language or Linux LSM mediation (SELinux AppArmor) prevents client C from sending messages to activatable service S and also prevents that client from calling StartServiceByName(). It is (perhaps unexpectedly) still possible for C to autostart S by sending a message to S: the message will be rejected and in particular S won't receive it but S will still be started first.

The patch-set that I'm about to attach makes it possibly for the XML policy and LSMs to prevent this. Specifically:

* If the XML policy language would not allow C to send the message to S the
  message is now rejected *before* starting S.

* Similarly if AppArmor would not allow C to send the message to S the
  message is now rejected *before* starting S.

  - If the D-Bus .service file has a new AssumedAppArmorLabel key we
    will ask AppArmor to evaluate the policy rules as though S will
    have that AppArmor label.

  - If not we will ask AppArmor to evaluate the policy rules as though
    S will have an unspecified AppArmor label. Any allow or deny rule
    that matches peer=(label=something) will not match the worst case
    here is that C is allowed to make S be started but sending the actual
    message is later denied (in other words regressing to current behaviour).

* If the XML policy language would not allow S to *receive* the message
  the message is still not rejected until after S has started. (This is
  because until then we can't know what the process attributes of S will be
  in particular its uid and gid and because more generally we don't
  compute the list of access-control rules that will apply to S until it
  has actually connected and we probably don't want to compute that list.)

  The XML policy language's receive rules are not used in practice so this
  is not really a big problem.

* If AppArmor would not allow S to receive the message from C
  the message is also still not rejected until after S has started to be
  consistent with the policy language. It would be possible to be
  symmetrical with the send rules for services with AssumedAppArmorLabel
  but not for services that do not have it (we cannot query an unspecified
  policy so we would effectively have to assume 'unconfined') I think
  that would probably be more confusing than the current situation.

I haven't implemented SELinux mediation because I don't use SELinux but I did pass the same information to selinux.c as to apparmor.c so that it would be easy for someone else to do.",20,"0"

    intel: Add a metaops version of glGenerateMipmapEXT/SGIS_generate_mipmaps.
    
    In addition to being HW accelerated it avoids the incorrect
    (black) rendering of the mipmaps that SW was doing in fbo-generatemipmap.
    Improves the performance of the mipmap generation and drawing in
    fbo-generatemipmap by 30%.

Screenshot from

Problem description: 
With my old user profile with very long history back to the beginnings of OO Names of the Area Gradients change with UI language. Gradient set shown in a newly created User Profile shows English color names independent from UI language.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open your Localized (French or German UI language) 
   LibreOffice
2. Launch Draw  ► Insert Shape  ► In Format Toolbar click
   Area  ► Gradients (Tab)
   » With a little luck you will see the names for the
     gradients in your language
3. Exit Libreoffice
4. In C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice 
   (or the folder where the User Profile for your installation
    might be) rename the folder with name 4 containing
    your user profile to 4_bak or so.
5. Do again steps 1 ... 2 (and change UI language back to
   French / German / whatever except English)

Current behavior: Now Gradients will show English names
Expected behavior: Gradient names in UI language

I did not test with what Version that problem really started.

May be the problem is mor simple No translation for area gradients? The gradients set I see with new profile is a different one from the one I see with my old user profile 8what might be a separate issue)

valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:294 (get_bszB_as_is): Assertion 'bszB_lo == bszB_hi' failed.
valgrind: Heap block lo/hi size mismatch: lo = 2560 hi = 18446744073709519887.
This is probably caused by your program erroneously writing past the
end of a heap block and corrupting heap metadata.  If you fix any
invalid writes reported by Memcheck this assertion failure will
probably go away.  Please try that before reporting this as a bug.

Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
It contains workarounds to several common problems.
In particular if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
identifying problems in your program there's a good chance
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
crashing especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.

If that doesn't help please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

In the bug report send all the above text the valgrind
version and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.

before calling the filter callback but it does not check whether the called
filter callback removed any callbacks from the (original) filter list using
dbus_bus_remove_match().

Maybe it could be fixed as follows:
1) Make a copy of the filter list (as before).
2) Call a callback in the list copy.
3) Remove the called callback from the list copy.
4) Remove all callbacks that do no longer occur in the original list from the
list copy.
5) If the list copy still has one or more functions go to step 2.

"XORG-6613","evdev hijacks the /dev/input/eventX device","Hi! 

I've been using X.org 6.8 with evdev mouse driver (hacked into X.org by gentoo)
for a while along with the evrouter program to manage extra buttons on my MS
Wireless Explorer mouse. This program monitors /dev/input/event_usb
(udev-created link to this mouse's evdev interface) and does specified actions
(simulates key presses) when extra mouse buttons are pressed.

All this worked fined until I installed X.org 7.0.

When I run X the mouse works fine but evrouter no longer works. Apparently X
somehow gets exclusive access to /dev/input/event_usb because even cat
/dev/input/event_usb produces absolutely no output when I move my mouse / press
any buttons on it. So evrouter doesn't read any mouse events from
/dev/input/event_usb.

This only pertains to the evdev mouse driver my trackpoint (handled by regular
mouse driver) produces output when I cat /dev/input/event_trackpoint.

relevant portion of xorg.conf:

Section InputDevice
        Identifier  usbmouse
        Driver      evdev
        Option      Device   /dev/input/event_usb

The xkbwatch tool from x11-xkb-utils is the best way to see this--it shows that no modifier key can ever reach the locked state.  This is a huge deal for people with mobility impairments who type with one finger a pen or like me a mouthstick.

XKB is the sole reason I was able to switch from Windows to Linux it is very critical to my daily use.  (Emacs is horrible without being able to lock modifier keys.)",634,"1"

editeng/source/misc/SvXMLAutoCorrectImport.cxx

The XFastParser interface is in offapi and needs a hash function to tokenise its input you'd want to look at sax/source/fastparser/fastparser.cxx to see how that works I guess.

This works fine if you disable KMS at kernel startup time.

Initially reported on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11. Reproduced on Moblin v2.0 beta (July 10th build) SUSE Edition of Moblin.

Also tested against the latest git release and the problem still seems present.

To reproduce:
On a system with latest Xorg git + kernel with KMS enabled
Run xrandr --output LVDS --scale 1x1.28 
The scaling does NOT happen.

To make it work:
On the same system place i915.modeset=0 (or disable KMS in some other way)
Run xrandr --output LVDS --scale 1x1.28 
The scaling does happen. Of course performances are bad.",4,"0"
"PULSEAUDIO-90489","[regression] DYNAMIC_LATENCY introduced in module-combine causes a race contition between pa_sink_render_into_full and sink_update_requested_latency_cb in alsa-sink.c","When sink_update_requested_latency() in src/modules/module-combine-sink.c:790 is called it posts a SINK_INPUT_MESSAGE_SET_REQUESTED_LATENCY message to all of it's output sinks. If one of the sinks is created by module-alsa-sink sink_update_requested_latency_cb() in src/alsa/alsa-sink.c:1507 is called to handle the latency change. This function except updating the latency sometimes also creates a rewind request. 

If the rewind request gets processed before the pa_sink_render_into_full() is called everything will work as supposed. However if not the !s->thread_info.rewind_requested assertion is being triggered on src/pulsecore/sink.c:1323 causing whole server to abort.

"LIBREOFFICE-73165","inline spellchecking waits for typing pauses before redlining errors","Hello

I have been using LibreOffice for years on Linux. I have recently noticed that spellchecking has become terribly slow. I am using Libreoffice 4.1.4.2 on Arch Linux on a fast Intel Core I5 laptop and I've never seen spellchecking this slow. It usually takes at least 1 second after hitting the spacebar after a misspelled word before it shows up with a red underline. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds or more. By this time I have usually typed far beyond that word and don't notice it anymore. This slowness occurs with both English and Spanish spellchecking and I imagine the other languages are the same. I can also confirm that on Firefox the built in spellchecking (which I believe uses the same engine?) is instantaneous and reliable. I can't really say when exactly this regression happened but a few months ago I don't think it was this bad on whatever the current LibO version was at that time.

Thanks for looking into this.

Steps to reproduce:

2. Select text range beginning in one paragraph and ending in the other (multiple paragraph text range).
3. Try to add a comment/annotation.

Current behavior:
Text range annotations are limited to a single paragraph at most.

Expected behavior:
It should be possible to add annotation/comment on multiple paragraph text range. According to ODF 1.2 I don't see any technical restriction not to support it.

The gist is a long shader output = white which should always create white since the shader has no kilp/discard. While this would rarely happen in practise (the glsl compiler would eliminate dead code) this is a clear bug and I believe this is causing me other grief.

"MESA-24150","tv out issues with radeon kms drm-next","Tv is CRT connected with s-video

Card is rv670 (Sapphire HD3850 AGP)

Monitor is PAL CRT connected with DVi -> VGA adapter.

Issue 1.

After loading modules using fbcon (1024x768 on monitor) TV mentions 1920x1200 and the output on TV is incorrect. Screen is split into two halves the left displaying correctly but squashed and the right side is a shifted slightly left and cropped copy of the right side displayed at half brightness.

drm debug=4 attached I notice 9 pin DIN is reported this card has a 7 pin DIN.

Issue 2.

After starting X the TV display is almost correct cloning 1024x768 monitor.

There are however two half bright green lines at the bottom and I can see from banding artifacts on Xorg -retro background that either the scale type is different or it is being scaled to a slightly smaller height. 

The green lines do not occur with modeset=0 and the background does not artifact (Though it will when scaling from other than 1024x768)

I noticed that a slightly different modeline is used between kms and ums for the TV. The ums is 59.9Hz vs 60Hz for kms.

xrandr --verboses attached.

I tried changing with xrandr but it didn't affect things (but then it seems that changing modes with different freq doesn't change the ums output either)

Issue 3.

This doesn't actually change anything but I notice when switching vts between X and fbcon after a few switches the modes reported become strange. TV still works as before.

However since glib-2.31 only glib.h may be included directly and the individual includes throw an error (see [1]). Before that change there was a long deprecation period.

The reason this hasn't blown up in fribidi (at least it builds here) is probably that glib.h is included in common.h masking the error.

I think these two includes should just be dropped.

do not drift one pixel above what we want - x2 y2 are exclusive max

The xorg drawable sizes are exclusive as I have learned on xorg-devel irc channel by MrCooper.
This means that width = x2 - x1  x2 behing exclusive and thus in the places the code does DrawBuffer->Width + x1 to get the right coordinate when we get a coordinate one pixel above what we want (ie we send x2 which is exclusive).

This patch fixes a few places were the gen2 865g are affected by this bug. That is gnome-shell renders badly due to cogl using atlas a power of two of the resolution (which is good but this leads to 2048 which is the framebuffer max size on gen2).

I used the Time Renderer javascript benchmark to get some numbers and those results confirm that usually with software rendering results are much better.

The behaviour always seems to be the same:
- The firefox process usually uses only little CPU
- XOrg too doesn't use a lot of CPU but quite a bit of time is spent in kernel-mode (e.g. 30-40%)
- System load seems to be low

So probably these workloads are GPU bound and xorg is simply waiting for the GPU to finish. When running the same workload with Vesa+ShadowFB rendering is usually 4-5x as fast.

At first I thought I had to RMA the notebook because the display only showed a single horizontal line in the middle of the screen. Rebooting the machine showed various problems: missing icons (like the faces icon for users on the GDM screen) and after logging in various bluish - magentaish rectangles on the screen. Rebooting back to 3.3.7 at the time didn't fix the problem but after yum reinstall * at least 3.3.7-1.fc17 is usable. 3.4.0-1.fc17 reliably shows this problem.

Today I accidentally reproduced this on my desktop machine with AMD Radeon HD6570 and kernel 3.4.0-1.fc17. I use Cinnamon on both machines. It turns out that the bad behaviour only shows up (but reliably) if I move the mouse pointer to the magic spot on the screen i.e. the top-left corner so the workspace switcher kicks in. Killing X with Ctrl-Alt-BkSp cures it. The difference between my desktop machine and the notebook is that for some reason when X starts the cursor shows up in the top-left corner on my notebook but in the middle of the screen on my desktop machine. So the error occurred on the notebook as soon login was attempted without moving the mouse.

Since I heard about the current state of ColorTiling2D is not yet usable I thought it might somehow kick in and created this file on my notebook:

	Option ColorTiling2D off

Fix for the levels array overflow

extremetuxracer 0.5 beta2 shows up a bug in r600c. 

The levels array in radeon_mipmap_tree structure is defined with a size of RADEON_MIPTREE_MAX_TEXTURE (ie 13). Though in radeon_try_alloc_miptree the size of numLevels can overflow this size.
Then in calculate_miptree_layout_r300 the loop write out of the array.
Which leads to calloc failure in bo_open from radeon_gem_bo due to corrupted memory.

This patch fixes this by setting the numLevels max to RADEON_MIPTREE_MAX_TEXTURE.",11,"0"

This prevents users (without sudo access) from using loginctl to log out of their own session. 

This would be useful for users who don't have a third party session manager or have a broken session manager and need a clean means of logging out.

By clean I mean a way that ends a specific session such as their currently logged in session without affecting other sessions (owned by themselves or other users).

I don't think it's necessary to require SUID for this function. Users aren't allowed to kill processes that don't belong to them anyway so it follows that a user would only be able to kill their own session(s). Perhaps this could be acheived with polkit?

Besides users (with polkit) already have acess to systemctl shutdown reboot hibernate and suspend loginctl kill-session seems less serious.

+1: if kill-session can be allowed to users to end their own sessions how about kill-user for users to end themselves?",248,"1"
"MESA-12141","glDrawElements bug for large array via indirect glx plus patch","When connected to a remote x-server using indirect glx the glDrawElements client side vertex array routine has a bug for large arrays.

The bug is in routine emit_DrawElements_old in file:
Mesa/src/glx/x11/indirect_vertex_array.c

If the number of elements is too large to fit into a single X packet it has to be spilt into multiple requests using the X RenderLarge command.  emit_DrawElements_old loops through the number of requests required outputting the maximum number of elements for a single request each time.  But it does not increment the start element pointer so that the first batch of elements is repeatedly sent in every request.  Elements towards the end of the input array are therefore never sent and not rendered.

The emit_DrawElements_old routine implements the GL 1.1 DrawArrays protocol.  This is the current protocol (old is a misnomer) used by X servers which support OpenGL including Xorg 7.x.  The bug can be demonstrated by sending a large glDrawElements array to a remote display server.",3,"0"

text file containing output from glxinfo and vulkaninfo

The version of dolphin-emu used for testing was version 5.0-5874 (this commit: https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/commit/01794126ade973a125161ca0ea9904197bccedc3 )

OS used is Debian 10 Buster (the current testing branch of debian).
I've attached the output of glxinfo and vulkaninfo from which you can see I'm currently on Mesa 17.2.5.
The GPU used is a RX 580.

When playing Super Smash Bros. Melee (NTSC version 1.02) a number of minor rendering issues/errors can be observed when using the Vulkan backend:
* The game's title screen does not render correctly.
* The background does not render correctly for some stages (Fountain of Dreams Final Destination etc...)
* The background for the trophy gallery does not render correctly
* The background for the small screen showing fighters clapping in the results screen seems to renders the wrong color (if playing as P1 against a CPU player 1 should render red not light-blue)
* Turning on cropping (Options -> Graphics Settings -> Advanced -> Misc -> Crop) results in a black screen.

None of the aforementioned bugs occur when using the OpenGL backend or when using the OpenGL or Vulkan backends using NVIDIA's closed-source drivers on a different computer w/GTX 960 so I suspect these are bugs in radv.

Below is a video I recorded showing the rendering errors and steps to reproduce the above issues:
https://youtu.be/mOhB-17b0rg

For comparison here is the game running on the OpenGL backend which does not have these rendering issues:
https://youtu.be/owA8TOa6LcQ

As an aside you may notice a disproportionate number of dropped frames compared to the FPS indicator in dolphin-emu at certain points in the videos I recorded.
I highly suspect this to be due to the following bug in GNOME3's Mutter compositor and not related to mesa/radv (it occurs even when not recording):

The keyboard layout fr variant dvorak by Josselin Mouette seems to be an illegal variant of the dvorak-fr¹ of Francis Leboutte which is distributed under the non free license CC-BY-NC-ND².
As a variation of a layout not allowed by the primary author this layout shouldn't be packaged with X.Org.

backtrace

I've got an apitrace that's causing a segfault in pipe_get_tile_z when the r600g driver is used. The trace can be replayed with llvmpipe without any problems.

I'm not quite sure if this is an apitrace issue or a driver bug. The application I have traced runs with llvmpipe but is causing a GPU hang with r600g.

I will describe how I obtain this bug :
Just after boot of my Linux box under KDE I stop the haldaemon service. There
is no hald process.

After that I launch hal with this command :
hald --daemon=no --verbose=yes

I join the end of the console output in hald_init.txt and lshal_init.txt

Now hald is not blocked :

course I can't reproduce the bug.

Test case which clears a depth-stencil attachment

Attached: test application to reproduce bug (see https://github.com/rikusalminen/querystall for build scripts etc. needs c99 compiler and CFLAGS).

Clearing GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24 target (instead of GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8) does not cause this behavior.

 The osdemos don't link for me but that's to be expected since I built mesa with the linux-dri-x86-64 config.  (hacked to use lib instead of lib64 since that's how Debian/Ubuntu do it).

 There's no Makefile in util.  There are some sources with main() functions in there although they're only tests for the code fragments so I guess that's appropriate.

"MESA-59442","glReadPixels doesn't smash alpha to 1.0 with RGB float formats","I recently fixed the fbo-blending-formats test in piglit to correctly
test that the alpha channel results when reading from a format with no
storage for an alpha channel is correctly set to 1.0.

See this patch (and two following patches) for my suggested fix to the
test:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/piglit/2013-January/004604.html

With my test changes in place the fbo-blending-formats (and perhaps
other related tests) fail due to the alpha channel not being set to
1.0 when reading from an floating-point RGB-only format.

For example

	Results for spec/ARB_texture_float/fbo-blending-formats/GL_RGB32F_ARB

	Using test set: GL_ARB_texture_float
	Probe at (320)
	  Expected: 0.480000 0.800000 0.680000 1.000000
	  Observed: 0.479980 0.799805 0.679688 0.499756
	  when testing FBO result blending with CONSTANT_COLOR.

In this test result it's clear that a value of alpha==0.5 was read
from a buffer with format GL_RGB32F and the correct value should be
alpha==1.0.

"LIBREOFFICE-67546","EDITING: related fields not shown if key is set as bigint unsigned on mysql","With the 4.1 version base no longer shows related fields of 1:n relationships in subforms of a mysql (native) db. A little experimenting showed that this happens only when the primary key is set to bigint unsigned. bigint alone works as do int unsigned.

Steps to reproduce:

1. create a simple mysql database

  CREATE TABLE `series` (
    `id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
    `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL

2. link this db to LibreOffice base and create a simple form with the wizard

Reproducible: Always with .903 not with .902 or .901

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch to virtual console and make some output occur (e.g. dmesg)
2. Switch back to X with Ctrl-Alt-F7

Actual Results:  
Fonts are corrupted can't read anything.

The current draft of the pkcs11 URI spec says:

   It is recommended to percent-encode the whole value of the id
   attribute which is supposed to be handled as arbitrary binary data.

(Confusingly it also says earlier only those octets that do not correspond to characters in the unreserved set or to permitted characters from the reserved set should be percent-encoded which should probably be fixed...)

commit 7aedbbacae6d3ec3d06735fff2eb662964773ad2
Author: Marek Olšák 
Date:   Sat Feb 6 22:09:45 2016 +0100

    radeonsi: put image fmask and sampler descriptors into one array
    
    The texture slot is expanded to 16 dwords containing 2 descriptors.
    Those can be:
    - Image and fmask or
    - Image and sampler state
    
    By carefully choosing the locations we can put all three into one slot
    with the fmask and sampler state being mutually exclusive.
    
    This improves shaders in 2 ways:
    - 2 user SGPRs are unused shaders can use them as temporary registers now
    - each pair of descriptors is always on the same cache line
    
    v2: cosmetic changes: add back v8i32 don't load a sampler state & fmask
        at the same time",0,"0"

Background: We have a mail-merge module which uses the python mail API that we bundle. The code lives in scripting/source/pyprov/ and (of course) can be edited and tweaked at run time. Unfortunately we have a steady flow of bugs from this code - which are primarily around error reporting: if people enter bad server information or wrong port numbers or have any number of problems - the error reporting is terrible.

"MESA-101739","An issue with alpha-to-coverage handling is causing Arma 3 64-bit Linux port to render trees incorrectly","The game is sometimes rendering trees. It has multiple tree mesh models and when the tree gets close the game is switching between different LODs/models by rendering both models overlapping on a grid of pixels as if checkerboard pixels of old LOD in black fields of it new one in white.

As long as it’s doing that using single-sampled buffers as render targets all is fine. However in higher quality modes the game switches to multisampled buffers. When using multisampled buffers if ATOC is turned on in settings the game is using alpha-to-coverage technique without polygon sorting to make sure that the grass is rendered correctly. At the same time it’s using depth test and depth write to fill up the depth buffer. In the same execution of fragment shader it sets the output color and alpha value and the depth buffer value and it expects the alpha value to cause the color value to end up only in some samples of multisampled texture and - the important bit - the depth value to end up only in the corresponding samples of the depth buffer.

This technique works on DX11 on Windows on all drivers on Mac OS X and on NVidia drivers on Linux but on Mesa Radeonsi drivers on Linux it makes the rendering go bad rendering most of the tree pixels white until the LOD transition ends.

The white is visible on the screen because it is the initial color of the multisampled render target and for some reason this color is allowed to leak through which means that in some cases the depth buffer value is set when the corresponding color buffer value isn’t.

Both depth and color buffer have the same number of samples (8) and were created with fixedSamples = true in OpenGL call.

It looks as if the depth buffer values in case of Mesa Radeonsi driver were:
 - correctly not written when the depth test fails for the fragment shader
 - correctly written to all samples of the depth buffer when alpha coverage directs the draw to fill them all but
 - INCORRECTLY assigned not only to those samples to which alpha coverage directed the fragment output color but either to all the samples in depth buffer or to samples in depth buffer that don’t correspond to the samples in color attachment buffer.

We encountered the same issue in 2015 in fglrx drivers contacted AMD team about it and received confirmation that it is a bug and that it was fixed. Unfortunately shortly after that fglrx drivers went out of use.

The issue can be easily reproduced in Arma 3 by:
 - launching Arma 3 game
 - switching to High quality or higher to turn on multisampled buffers
 - enabling ATOC (alpha to coverage) in Video settings or making sure it's enabled
 - launching first level of Drawdown 2035 campaign ie. starting a new campaign bypassing optional tutorial and observing as the main character walks into the base the bushes flicker white from time to time as they get closer.

"XORG-15903","LANG=en_US xclock -digital -font fixed has wrong size","In a locale other than C running xclock -digital with fixed font and no other X resources results in a window that is too narrow.  Looking at recent changes to xclock's Clock.c there appears to be a subtle logic error for which I have attached a simple patch.

The first attachment shows an xclock started with LANG=en_US.utf-8 xclock -digital with no X resources.

Look at Clock.c from the xclock source code.

Find this block of code around line 680.  The if (!no_locale) statement below used to just be an else in an earlier version and the no_locale = True else statement was not present.  Clearly (looking at a wider section of code than pasted here) the lower block is supposed to be run in the event of a null value for w->clock.fontSet.

	       min_height = fse->max_logical_extent.height +
		 3 * w->clock.padding
	   } else {
	       no_locale = True
	   }
       }

       if (!no_locale)
#endif /* NO_I18N */
       {
	   if (w->clock.font == NULL)
	       w->clock.font = XQueryFont( XtDisplay(w)


The problem is that this used to be an if (...) { ... } else if (...) { ... } else { ... } and has now become an if (...) { ... } else if (...) { ... } if (...) { ... }.  The last if block (the if (!no_locale) block the beginning of which is shown above) should not be run if the first if block (if (w->clock.render)) was true.  This is a simple case of a missing set of braces.  It's pretty obvious studying the code but it's not that easy to see because of all the #ifdefs.

The second attachment is a patch that fixes the problem.  The patch just adds a missing set of braces and reindents the intervening code.  I hope you will consider inclusion of this patch.  I have also reported this in both Red Hat's and Debian's bug tracking systems.

Hm I'm not an expert on Xprt but there is no default colormap for non-default
visuals therefore you need to install one first. The behavior may differ
between
implementations but I don't think the behavior is wrong and one cannot conclude
from the behavior of one DDX implementation that another one must act the same

"MESA-74113","GLSL: vectorize optimization does not take branches into account","Vectorize multiple scalar assignments optimization (added in 4bd6e0d7c69 on master) does not take possible branches into account.

For example on a fragment shader like this:

{
    vec4 c = texture2D (maintex uv)

It does try to merge both coord.x and coord.y assignments into one even if they are under different branch conditions. Effectively it ends up with if (cond) coord.xy += ... which is wrong.

Real-life shaders like FXAA3.11 have a code very similar to the above and it regresses under this optimization.

Hello

I use fribidi library in BiDiTeX project --
support of Hebrew for LaTeX documents and I found
that when I work with documents in cp1255
LRM/RLM marks are not converted correctly
and the code does not work.

There is a bug in fribidi library or
more exactly in fribidi_cp1255_to_unicode_c()
and fribidi_unicode_to_cp1255_c() functions.

It does not convert LRM/RLM marks to UNICODE symbols
as required (253 254  0x200E0x200F).

The same happens in reverse direction
(unicode to cp1255)

The easiest way to reproduce the problem is following:
Take text (a א!RLM b) in utf-8
and run through fribidi you'll see a !א b as it should be
Same text encoded with cp1255 run with fribidi -c cp1255
you'll see a א! b -- incorrect one.

    drm/i915: refuse to submit more batchbuffers from guilty context

    If context has recently submitted a faulty batchbuffers guilty of
    gpu hang and decides to keep submitting more crap ban it permanently.

    Note: This is just a refinment of the existing policy to declare the
    gpu wedged when it's hanging too often. We have that in place to
    increase the odds of a system surviving gpu hang storms (and so
    getting a useful bug report with the error state).

    With this patch here we reduce the risk to take down unrelated
    applications since especially modern compositors tend to die when
    mesa can't submit batches any more. So for the somewhat common case of
    a specific gl workload causing a gpu hang flurry we should now have
    less grumpy users since we don't take down their entire deskopt
    enviroment any more.

    v2: Store guilty ban status bool in gpu_error instead of pointers
        that might become danling before hang is declared.

    v3: Use return value for banned status instead of stashing state
        into gpu_error (Chris Wilson)

    glsl/linker: link-error using the same name in unnamed block and outside
    
    According with OpenGL GLSL 4.20 spec section 4.3.9 page 57:
    
       It is a link-time error if any particular shader interface
        contains:
          - two different blocks each having no instance name and each
            having a member of the same name or
          - a variable outside a block and a block with no instance name
            where the variable has the same name as a member in the block.
    
    This means that it is a link error if for example we have a vertex
    shader with the following definition.
    
      layout(location=0) uniform Data { float a float b }
    
    and a fragment shader with:
    
      uniform float a
    
    As in both cases we refer to both uniforms as a and thus using
    glGetUniformLocation() wouldn't know which one we mean.
    
    This fixes KHR-GL*.shaders.uniform_block.common.name_matching.

"SYSTEMD-89269","systemd-networkd: auto-load iptables kernel modules","Description:
I was playing around systemd-nspawn containers and new systemd-219 feature: default masquerading veth'ed (started with --network-veth) containers and faced a weird systemd-networkd behaviour.
systemd-networkd could not enable or disable IP masquerading (and do any other firewall related things like forwarding I suppose) if iptables haven't been touched anyhow since boot time.


How to reproduce:

The most important prerequisite here is that iptables haven't been touched since boot time. iptables shouldn't be touched either by iptables-load from iptables.service or manually from console.
Run
# iptables-save
and its output should be completely empty. Not tables with empty rules just no output at all.

1. Then prepare some distro in some directory to use with nspawn.
2. Start systemd-networkd on host.
3. Boot container with -n (--network-veth) option:
# systemd-nspawn -n -b -D $path_to_container
4. Try to ping from container: ping won't be able to reach anything.
5. See systemd-networkd status on host:
# systemctl status systemd-networkd
It will report:
systemd-networkd: ve-%containername% : Could not enable IP masquerading: Protocol not avaliable
6. Turn off container.
7. Touch iptables e. g.:
# iptables -t nat --list
After you have touched iptables in such way iptables-save will output tables with empty set of rules.
8. Now boot container and try to ping: voilà it pings!
9. Check systemd-networkd status: there is no any complains now.",60,"0"

"DBUS-11876","EXTERNAL authentication fails on setuid applications","The EXTERNAL authentication method doesn't work if the effective UID of the client is different from its real UID which happens for instance on setuid applications.

That's because the client sends its real UID while the server checks the effective UID.

Here's a pseudo-callstack of the client:
1/ handle_client_response_mech()
2/ dbus_credentials_add_from_current_process()
3/ _dbus_credentials_add_unix_uid()
4/ _dbus_getuid()
5/ getuid()

While the server gets the effective uid in _dbus_read_credentials_socket() (through SO_PEERCRED and other methods).

I guess _dbus_credentials_add_unix_uid() should call _dbus_geteuid() (which doesn't exist yet) but i'm not sure about how much code depends on the current behaviour of that function.",161,"0"

Proof of concept

There is a division by zero in Stream.cc:471. In the ImageStream constructor INT_MAX is divided by nComps parsing the attached PoC.pdf case nComps has the value 0. The division by 0 caused a SIGFPE crash

 461 ImageStream::ImageStream(Stream *strA int widthA int nCompsA int nBitsA) {
 462   int imgLineSize
 463 
 464   str = strA
 465   width = widthA
 466   nComps = nCompsA
 467   nBits = nBitsA

 469   nVals = width * nComps
 470   inputLineSize = (nVals * nBits + 7) >> 3
 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {

A possible solution is to check for this case:
 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || nComps ==0 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {

"XORG-3048","External monitor inoperable on GeForce4 MX with AGP8X (Mac)","I am trying to get a sensible signal onto the external VGA connector of an iMac
G5 (PCI id of video chip 10de:0189 the name above is taken from nv_driver.c). 
I'm running a self-built x.org 6.8.2 (2005-2-9). 

Although a quick look into the nv sources seems to indicate that there is at
least some support for head selection (or even multi-headed operation?) I did
not succeed.

Here is what I tried:

(a) Plain Driver nv: No signal the external  connector

(b) Option CrtcNumber 1 in Device section: No valid modes found.  The log
says (among other things):

(II) NV(0): I2C device DDC:ddc2 removed.
(**) NV(0): Forcing CRTCNumber 1 as specified
(II) NV(0): Using DFP on CRTC 1
(--) NV(0): Panel size is 1 x 1

xorg then of course removes all video modes

(c) additionally
	Option FlatPanel false
in Device Section and an External Screen reference in ServerLayout where

Section Monitor
	Identifier	External VGA
	HorizSync	28-130
	VertRefresh	43-90
EndSection

and
Section Screen
	Identifier	External Screen
	Device		Nvidia G5
	Monitor		External VGA
[Modes definition]
EndSection

Some signal on the external VGA port DCC runs and identifies the device
attached (in my case a beamer).  xorg correctly finds some modes and chooses
the default one (1280x1024).  The beamer senses 1280x1024 too but does not
display anything (or rather black).  However the built-in panel now displays
funky patterns -- always the same ones so I assume it's gdm's login screen at
horribly wrong depth and resolution.  On terminating the server the beamer
senses a loss of video signal.

Phenomena analogous to (c) occur when I try a ServerLayout with two screens.

Ideally I'd like to mirror the LCD on the external monitor.  Any chance this
will ever work (unless nvidia cooperates)?

I'd be willing to help fix this but I'd highly appreciate pointers to
documentation in whatever form.",677,"1"

"TELEPATHY-31631","Serious issues with TpClientChannelFactoryInterface","While starting to use TpClientChannelFactoryInterface in Empathy I found 2 big issues with it.

A) tp_base_client_set_channel_factory() is broken. This is fixed in http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=user/cassidy/telepathy-gliba=commitdiffh=9deb3dcad3a60f43d6367296ae32f2b26c4103a6

B) The 'self' pointer passed to method implementation is wrong.
-    return iface->dup_channel_features (iface channel)
+    return iface->dup_channel_features (self channel)
solves it but it seems that something is wrong.

This cast is suspicious self is supposed to already be a TpClientChannelFactoryInterface so why do we need to cast it?

 TpClientChannelFactoryInterface *iface = TP_CLIENT_CHANNEL_FACTORY_GET_IFACE (
      self)

And I'm wondering if the TP_CLIENT_CHANNEL_FACTORY macro really makes sense as that's an iface and not an object?",2,"0"

Since updating my drivers from the 2.1.1 stable of xf86-video-i810 to 2.5.1 of the intel drivers 2D acceleration has become dramatically slower. When opening or restoring windows the contents of them can be seen clearly being drawn on the screen. Amarok maybe takes 2-3 seconds to draw itself before it becomes responsive. During this the X process has high cpu usage similarly it is high when any 2d rendering is being done for example when Amarok is open the standard visualisation running makes the X process use 10-30% cpu time. I have tried a plethora of xorg.conf settings but none work including XAA (i think it has been removed in the latest 2.5.X releases but I tried it with 2.4.3)",227,"1"

"MESA-26525","Rendering bug due to ARB_texture_non_power_of_two","While trying to address a D3D rendering bug report in Wine I've been working on trying to add card recognition support into Wine for the Mesa ATI (R300/R600) drivers. This was in order to resolve a rendering issue when using the Mesa ATI driver. What we've found is that a code workaround to avoid using ARB_texture_non_power_of_two APIs on R300-R500 cards also seems to fix this rendering issue on Mesa DRI R600 (in particular with an HD4800 series card). This would seem to indicate a bug in the ARP texture_non_power_of_two implementation on R600. The Wine bug report is at 
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21515

Comments #45-47 indicate that the rendering problem is fixed by activating a quirk/workaround that avoids ARB_texture_non_power_of_two. Stefan Dosinger's comment #48 indicates what the quirk workaround does how it should not be required on an R600/R700 series card and how that indicates a probable driver bug.",1015,"1"

The current select widget set-up is sub-optimal because it masks the available languages and OSes pushing them into secondary UI for no good reason. Also a user cannot easily use find in page to get to the language she's looking for. Just make it a big list instead. 

This page should have a link somewhere at the bottom for older versions but should absolutely not offer two different versions -- that does nothing but confuse potential users.",129,"0"

    conversion and blending. This patches enables denorms for
    blending. It's a little tricky due to the llvm bug that makes
    it incorrectly reorder the mxcsr intrinsics:

dmesg drm-intel-nightly 3.18.0-00343-gfc7bddc

Hardware:
- Lenovo ThinkPad T440s + ThinkPad Pro Dock 40A1
- 1. monitor (Dell U2410 1920x1200) at DP of docking station
- 2. monitor (Dell U2413 1920x1200) at VGA of docking station

If I boot this setup with both monitor attached to the console and remove the monitor (unplug the connector) at the DP then I can reproduce the attached backtrace (not?) always.

Instructions for building the Vkd3d test suite:
-----------------------------------------------

Source code: git://source.winehq.org/git/vkd3d.git

autogen.sh
configure
make

Updated Spriv headers may be needed:

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers.git
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers.git

CPPFLAGS=-I/home/tarceri/git/SPIRV-Headers/include -I/home/tarceri/git/Vulkan-Headers/include ./configure

Also an undated version of widl (a tool in the wine project) may be needed:

git://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git

./configure --without-freetype
make tools/widl

Then pass the new build to configure for Vkd3d e.g.

"XORG-3674","Display problem (horizontal dark lines) on 17inch widescreen KISS Technology TFT monitor","I have a 17inch widescreen TFT monitor made by Kiss Technology.
Their website is being overhauled atm but I found direct links to the monitor
info and brochure page: http://www.kiss-technology.com/?p=coolview3

I have a creative GeForce2 GTS (nvidia) graphics card.

The problem: the colour of the display is darker with horizontal bands from
'bleed' of colour i.e. the relatively darker colour of the titlebar of a window
will spread outwards left and right from the window to fill the screen.

monitor-edid output is:

  ModeLine 1280x1024 135 1280 1296 1440 1688 1024 1025 1028 1066 -hsync -vsync


This does pose an immediate question. Why is it suggesting 1280x1024 when it is
a widescreen monitor surely it should be suggesting 1280x768 (even Kiss website
lists that as the max resolution)?

When you have a document open in Writer if you hover over this body text link a tool tip comes up that says to Ctrl-Click to follow the link. If you ctrl-click the link the link opens in your web browser.

In frame text you can also do Insert > Hyperlink and create a link. However it is not functional. It's present - if you double click on the frame it highlights you can right-click it and edit the hyperlink properties... but there is no way to click on the link. Click ctrl+click shift+click all do nothing.

Expected behavior:

I would expect a hyperlink in a text frame to behave the same way hyperlinks behave in body text.

"WAYLAND-81745","wl_data_device lacks destructor protocol causes leaks","wl_data_device interface does not have a destructor defined in the protocol which means that the server cannot know if a client destroys a wl_data_device object. This leaks the server-side resource.

To make things worse wl_data_device.data_offer *event* creates a new wl_data_offer protocol object.

If a client has destroyed a wl_data_device the server will not know about it and will keep sending data_offer events as appropriate. As the client does not track the wl_data_device object anymore those events will be ignored in the client. This means that in the server wl_data_offer objects just keep piling up as the server cannot destroy them on its own.

If possible we should add destructor protocol to wl_data_device interface.",102,"0"

The internal panel shows a flickering screen (looks like a moire-effect)
and so we checked the server log and the xrandr-output (both attached).

We found an interesting line in the Xorg.log (and in the xrandr-
output):

(II) RADEON(0): Printing probed modes for output LVDS
(II) RADEON(0): Modeline 1400x1050x60.2  108.00  1400 34200 34312 1688  \

I have no idea whether this is related to the flicker problem but
in any case - something is wrong probably an underflow and hope-
fully the driver does not try to use these values for the panel :-)

We did not have the flickering problem with the old radeon-driver
without xrandr 1.2 support.

I have learned that much of the mode handling is done in the
server so this may also be a server problem.

Crash does not occur with classic (not Sidebar) stylist because if there is no bullet command (in step 4.) is unavailable which is correct.

Crash occurs because there is no bullet so there is no List style to create.

With LibO 4.3.0.0 the command is available but the created list style is hidden. Select another style type and come back to List Styles. Created list style contains numbering bullets.

From my point of view the classic stylist has correct behavior: command should be unavailable if no bullet/numbering is selected.",50,"0"

hardware-decoded screenshot

Hi

on latest Mesa I still get tons of artifacts when decoding MPEG2 on my AMD card via VAAPI to the point where it is not usable for video decoding at all to be honest.
I've attached sample screenshots to show the problem - one software-decoded and one hardware-decoded via libva in mpv.
The sample video is taken from https://www.w6rz.net/1080p25.zip but the artifacts are visible more or less on any MPEG2 video including DVDs.

There is this older bug report: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93760 but I'm not sure it's related because I do not get any assertion failure and it vaguely reads like it has been fixed?

For clarification I see no artifacts with VDPAU.

Tested with Mesa-19.1.0-devel (git-bea540173c) libva 2.5.0-pre1 (git-c98b06d2b8) FFmpeg N-93467-g54655623a8
VAAPI driver string: Mesa Gallium driver 19.1.0-devel for Radeon RX 580 Series (POLARIS10 DRM 3.27.0 4.20.13-arch1-1-ARCH LLVM 7.0.1)

I verified this with mpv gstreamer and Kodi.
mpv seems to have disabled mpeg2 hw decoding by default due to this problem: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/3dd59dbe
In Kodi we cannot go this route because we want to support low-end hardware that might have trouble decoding 1080p in software out-of-the-box.
I want to avoid having to blacklist the radeon vaapi driver for mpeg2 if possible.",51,"0"

I think the best thing would be to separate the (automatic) formatting of the title from the formatting of the page number that should perhaps be in a separate style.

"MESA-67564","HiZ buffers are much larger than necessary","Found by code inspection:

The intel_miptree_alloc_hiz() function calls intel_miptree_create() passing it the exact same format first_level last_level width height depth and num_samples that were used to create the parent miptree.  This means that exactly the same amount of memory will be set aside for the HiZ buffer as for the main depth buffer.

For Z24 buffers this is too large by roughly a factor of 8.  For Z16 buffers it's too large by roughly a factor of 4.  This wastes physical memory as well as available aperture space since the kernel ensures that all of the pages of the HiZ buffer are resident and mapped into the GPU's address space before running an execbuffer even if not all of the pages are actually needed by the GPU.

For Gen7 we should use the formulas in the bspec to set the HiZ buffer size.  For Gen6 we may need to do some research to figure out the correct formulas because on Gen6 we are still using X/Y offsets to manually select which part of the miptree to render to and our notion of the miptree layout may not match that used by the hardware.",591,"1"

Stack trace of the crash

When Dolphin-emu is compiled with EGL (-DUSE_EGL=ON) and set to single core mode (Config > General > Enable Dual Core disabled) it crashes in egl_dri3_get_dri_context().

This doesn’t happen in dual core mode (where the emulated GPU is running on a different thread than the emulated CPU) or when Dolphin is compiled with GLX as its context API but it happens on both Xorg and Xwayland since both are using DRI3.",155,"0"
"XORG-1947","Logitech MX 1000 mouse: xorg does not see all 12 buttons","Description of problem:
I plugged in Logitech MX 1000 mouse. Xorg server does not distinguish
some of its buttons. xev shows button numbers up to 5 - the side
buttons do not work. There is a discussion here:
http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wfsection/print.php?articleid=46.
I tried the approach described there (writing 12 buttons and other
options into xorg.conf) - but found that protocol evdev is not
supported.

xorg server would need ability to work with evdev Protocol directly
(there are some patches mentioned on that page).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
xorg-x11-6.8.1-12.FC3.1

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Plug in Logitech MX 1000 mouse (USB port)
2. Configure xorg.conf to use 12 buttons 
3. xmodmap -e pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4 5

    

Actual Results:  xmodmap says it only sees 7 buttons so cannot map 12
of them

Expected Results:  swapping buttons 11/12 and 4/5",52,"0"

Using top in a console I see kwin is using 100% cpu. This also happens when going in system Settings and defining screen-edge action.
The file i915_error_state is empty.

Also I noticed some artefacts for example some combobox not showing (this bug though does not seem reproductible 100%)

journalctl log including the hang in the report

I'm using only DRI_PRIME=1 GALLIUM_HUD=fpsVRAM-usage+GTT-usage. I have not tested much different combinations.

Tested on linux 3.16 mainline.

I'm not 100% sure but I think this is my bisect result:
1cfcd0164e1be7d7b05b693f60a262ad735b7565 is the first bad commit

I haven't tested that much applications because it has a good chance of a hard lockup of the whole machine. But often it recovers after killing the application with the HUD.

With the Unreal Engine Cave Effects demo I think I can reproduce it every time and in fact it is immediately visible whether it will work (when changing mesa versions) because when it works immediately a black window with the HUD is visible until the demo loads and when it won't work a few fat white garbage lines will be visible in the window or something like that.

I only tried glxgears as another application a few times and sometimes it worked and sometimes it produced the lockup.

A nice minor enhancement to break this up on FPE boundaries would make the
font path more readable and also help to spot font path related issues
in bug reports.

Myself and Bruno Wolff noted that remaining sysv services on our systems seemed to be being started even though we had not explicitly enabled them and they did not appear as SXX(service) symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ (which is what indicates them as 'enabled' so far as SysV is concerned).

I noticed that the affected services seem to appear in /run/systemd/generator.late/network-online.target.wants  and traced things out from there.

I found that if a file in /etc/init.d contains an LSB stanza like:

# Required-Start: $network

then on boot there will be a symlink to the sysv-generator converted service in /run/systemd/generator.late/network-online.target.wants . (This also applies to Should-Start and I think to NetworkManager-wait-online - I think this will be triggered by anything considered to match SPECIAL_NETWORK_ONLINE_TARGET in sysv-generator around line 515).

Poking through sysv-generator.c  I believe I figured out what's going on here. What it's actually trying to do is the converse: to implement the service wants the network to be up dependency expressed by Required-Start: $network or similar create a symlink to network-online.target in foo.service.wants/ . But the argument ordering is wrong for at least *this* case.

generate_unit_file() does this for s->wants relationships:

        STRV_FOREACH(p s->wants) {
                r = add_symlink(*p s->name)
                if (r < 0)
                        log_error_unit(s->name Failed to create 'Wants' symlink to %s: %s *p strerror(-r))
        }

At least in the affected case it's basically calling add_symlink(wanting servicewanted service) . but the logic of add_symlink() is add_symlink(fromto) so it winds up creating a symlink from wanting.service to wanted.service.wants/wanting.service - making wanted.service depend on wanting.service exactly the opposite of what we want.

So I wrote a patch to fix that by simply inverting the order of the add_symlink() parameters:

                r = add_symlink(s->name *p)

but I found a couple of problems. This gets the logic right for the affected case but still doesn't actually work because it winds up creating a symlink like this:

/run/systemd/generator.late/plague-server.service.wants/network-online.target -> /run/systemd/generator.late/network-online.target

it should point to /lib/systemd/system/network-online.target  but it's not smart enough to realize that. I also realized that sysv-generator uses the generate_unit_file() wants stuff in two other cases and for at least one of those the ordering is correct. e.g. I create a symlink:

/etc/rc3.d/S50foo -> /etc/init.d/foo

So setting the service foo to be 'enabled' for runlevel 3 in sysv language. Now when I boot sysv-generator creates:

/run/systemd/generator.late/runlevel3.target.wants/foo.service -> /run/systemd/generator.late/foo.service

that's using the same bit of generate_unit_file() but for *this* usage the ordering is correct and does what we actually want: foo will run in 'runlevel3'. So we can't simply invert the ordering of the add_symlink() call without causing other problems.

So I think we need to go to load_sysv() and look at the special handling of the network online target:

                                        if (streq(m SPECIAL_NETWORK_ONLINE_TARGET) && !is_before) {
                                                /* the network-online target is special as it needs to be actively pulled in */
                                                r = strv_extend(
                                                if (r < 0)
                                                        return log_oom()
                                                r = strv_extend(
                                                if (r < 0)
                                                        return log_oom()
                                        }

and do...something different there. But I'm afraid my C isn't quite up to handling that 'something different' I don't think. I hope I've correctly analyzed the problem at least though.

Obviously this bug is fairly serious - it means all sysv services present on the system will be started any time network-online.target is Wanted by anything *else* (which is usually the case on a typical system). This could even cause a security problem - imagine you have /etc/init.d/telnet ...",1,"0"

"POPPLER-69608","poppler_page_get_text() ordering does not agree with poppler_page_get_text_layout() as docs say it should","Whilst trying to extract textual information from PDFs it seems that the documentation for poppler_page_get_text_layout() is not correct or there is a bug in poppler_page_get_text(). The documentation for poppler_page_get_text_layout says:

The position in the array represents an offset in the text returned by poppler_page_get_text().

(Note that the documentation says the same for poppler_page_get_text_attributes).

However this doesn't seem to be the case. The problem is described succinctly here complete with a short piece code which reproduces the problem:

The linked PDF [1] gives 1541 glyphs from poppler_page_get_text and 1477 glyphs from poppler_page_get_text_layout. It does not appear to be related to unicode encoding.

binary edid info for vga. this works fine

Hello- after much reading and trying to fix this problem here is the situation:

LG Monitor model L245WP does not work properly when driven by hdmi. Symptom is a screen shifted left and up and cropped on left and right sides. picture quality is poor too. The monitor works fine when driven by vga.

The symptoms I'm seeing match these discussions seen elsewhere which led to solutions for windows operating systems.
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=1884351
http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/showthread.php?t=62749
http://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/showthread.php?t=310242

To summarize those threads the problem is in the monitor's EDID which describes the monitor incorrectly when interrogated over hdmi. The EDID information on the vga connection appears to be correct. To solve the symptoms windows users overrode the EDID information in the registry with a corrected synthetic EDID. Linux users running (older versions of) nvidia drivers were able to override EDID information as well which fixed the symptom. (The nvidia driver's IgnoreEDID option has been deprecated so I believe this fix is not possible now.)

The incorrect EDID information has to do with the width of the monitor being reported as 432mm instead of 520 as seen in Xorg logs:

(II) intel(0): Supported detailed timing:
(II) intel(0): clock: 154.0 MHz   Image Size:  432 x 324 mm

which contradicts an earlier line in the Xorg log showing 520mm:

(II) intel(0): Max Image Size [cm]: horiz.: 52  vert.: 32

Please let me know what more information you need from me to fix this. Additionally it would be nice to be able to work around this bug when using xrandr for dynamic adjustment of video settings - is this the right place for that request?

Thanks

However if you do the same but the block starts at A4 using PageUp will unselect 3 rows at a time.

This bug is present since the first LO Beta and does not occur in OOo Calc.",1,"0"

When creating queries with more than one table and linking them using an outer join (by clicking on the line in the graphical query editor and setting the join type to outer join) the query does not work.  It reates a syntax error because LO inersts a OJ token in the query which PostgreSQL can not handle.

I found no possibility to turn of the OJ token inserting.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a query with two tables that use an outer join
2. Execute the query

"XORG-30047","radeon [XPRESS 200M] OpenOffice crashes X server when previewing too long footnotes","Created attachment 38480
sample document which can cause OOo to crash (last footnote)

When hovering over a reference to a footnote a preview appears. However when
the footnote is long (> 4 lines) the preview is distorted (something I can
live with) and when it is very long (7 lines or more) OpenOffice crashes
taking with it the whole X server. This happens also with a clean user
directory so no corrupted personal settings.
I just found a Ubuntu bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/606602. Compiz
actually reports text length exceeded. It seems to be the same issue: OOo doesn't line-break in footnote previews - if the preview is
much too long for one line OOo does _something_ which 
-in Gome with Compiz (there's no information about the graphics) crashes
Compiz
-in XFCE with Compiz and proprietary Nvidia driver leaves just an empty
tooltip
-in KDE SC with KWin and free radeon driver crashes X.

It's very annoying because in my scientific writings I have a lot of long
footnotes and every now and then OOo crashes. It took me weeks to find out the
reason.

For comparison I tested OO.org on my other machine with an NVidia card: On
Windows everything is shown correctly on XFCE longer previews (from 4 lines
on) are displayed as withe fields but no crash.

Even when replacing those calls with glFinish() and XSync() fixes the problem I was wondering what has changed in Mesa so that this is happening now and whether it should be fixed in Mesa or in S&R.",16,"0"

"HAL-15346","Better way to detect mobile phones' modems","Noticed at
http://blogs.gnome.org/dcbw/2008/03/02/networkmanager-your-gsm-mobile-and-you/

that the suggested way to detect GSM mobile phone is as follows:


        
          

e.g. by vendor and product id and usb interface number. This is really
inefficient as you'd have to create a separate entry for each mobile phone and
there are dozens or hundreds of models. Most modern mobiles use USB CDC ACM
specification and accordingly the modem interface is using a defined USB
interface class and subclass:

Interface Descriptor:
      bLength                 9
      bDescriptorType         4
      bInterfaceNumber        8
      bAlternateSetting       0
      bNumEndpoints           1
      bInterfaceClass         2 Communications
      bInterfaceSubClass      2 Abstract (modem)
      bInterfaceProtocol      1 AT-commands (v.25ter)
      iInterface              8 CDC Comms Interface

I'm not sure what is the exact .fdi syntax to use the class and subclass
values but you can probably work it out :)

Some discussion is available here: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525305
In particular bInterfaceProtocol seems to be always 1 in actual devices so it cannot be relied upon for determining advanced command sets such as GSM/CDMA.",384,"1"
"XORG-37549","Dell Studio XPS 1340 - fails to enter suspend mode","This problem was originally reported here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/754711

The system works correctly with the Ubuntu-patched 2.6.35 Kernel as shipped with Ubuntu 10.10 but fails with the 2.6.38 kernel from Ubuntu 11.04.

While tracking down this problem I tested several mainline kernels all of which also fail to suspend/resume on this system as I describe below.

Steps to reproduce:
- try to enter suspend mode (I used sudo pm-suspend)

Expected result:
- The system enters sleep mode and upon pressing the power switch resumes successfully

Actual result:
I tried this with the following kernels (all mainline):

2.6.39-999.201104080911 - The system enters suspend mode but upon trying to resume the system is unresponsive: backlight doesn't come on there is no display keyboard is unresponsive and system doesn't respond to pings on the network.

2.6.38-3-natty mainline kernel. The system boots and is usable enters suspend mode but upon attempting to resume is unresponsive the backlight doesn't come up no display keyboard is unresponsive and system doesn't respond to pings on the network. At some point I saw capslock flashing but it stopped after a bit.

v2.6.35.12-maverick mainline kernel with this kernel the system boots but when trying to enter graphical mode becomes unresponsive no keyboard network ping or display (screen is black). 

Here is some relevant information on the system please let me know if any more tests are needed.

Hang report

Space Engineers is causing GPU hangs. It's something about the terrain that does it - playing in space works fine for hours at a time but starting a new game on a planet hangs in a minute or two.

Terrain is really messed up on planets so there's probably game or Wine bugs at work too.

Hang report attached. Despite talking about /tmp/radv-trace.txt a lot it didn't actually create this file.

presentation file to reproduce with

After opening a .pptx file and copying some slides to a new presentation LibreOffice crashed on starting the slide show. I have attached a minimal file that can be used to reproduce the issue.

My system:
64-bit Arch Linux with LibreOffice 4.2.2.1. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached presentation file.
2. Go to the slide sorter and copy the slides to clipboard.
3. Open a new empty presentation and paste the slides to the end of the slide sorter giving you 3 slides total.
4. Start presenting. (for me in the mode that shows both the current and next slide on the screen)
5. Go to the next slide. 

What should happen:
Libreoffice should show the next slide and the slide after that (with text) in the next-slide-box.

What happens:
Libreoffice keeps the next-slide-box empty and shows a message-box with title LibreOffice 4.2 - Fatal Error and no content except for the exception icon. On pressing OK it completely terminates. 

Running with --backtrace:
I got no interesting output just:
[Inferior 1 (process 27016) exited with code 0115]
/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/gdbtrace:9: Error in sourced command file:
No stack.
quit

Other things that might be related:
- The presentation uses Calibri a font I do not have. (I imported it from a .pptx file)
- The bullet characters show up as blocks likely also a font thing.",226,"1"

Xorg log

Hi

I'm running an Eee Box B206 with an integrated Radeon HD 3450 connected to a Samsung LCD TV.

Since the radeon driver doesn't support audio through HDMI I've connected an audio cable separately from the computer's sound card. This works fine until I start X -- then the audio stops. Well the audio is still coming out from the line out but the TV thinks that audio should come through HDMI and doesn't care about the cable.

Apparently the radeon driver is telling the TV that it supports audio even though it doesn't. The radeonhd driver does not have this problem (but I can't use it because I need Xv). Also if I switch VC to text mode audio comes back. It disappears as soon as I switch back to X.

xrandr reports the output as DVI-0.

I'm running Debian with Xorg 7.4 Xserver 1.6.1.901 and latest xf86-video-ati from git (76af48c43f829e7aebacc9f2a623823fa26ee22b).

Full Xorg.0.log (gziped)

This bug is a follow up to #54808.

I'm still using Fedora 17 on a notebook with an ivb GT2 and I'm still using that old cairo version 1.10.2 (sorry). Again it is not possible to view the large NASA picture (http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20120705a/PIA15689_Greeley_Pan_wDeck_L257F.jpg) using eog but now I'm getting a new error message in Xorg.0.log:

__kgem_bo_map__gtt: failed to retrieve GTT offset for handle=54: 7

The handle number differs from time to time. The full Xorg.0.log is attached.

I tested ver. 2.20.10 of the driver and the latest version from git (66eb0adff...) and got the same result.

Viewing the picture worked perfectly after bug #54808 was fixed. I'm not sure what update since then led to the problem. I got a new kernel (3.6.6 instead of 3.5.3) but I can reproduce the issue with kernel 3.3.4 (unfortunately I don't have 3.5.3 anymore) so it's unlikely that kernel 3.6 causes the trouble.

I'd be glad to help tracking down the problem but if the old cairo version causes the trouble and you say it's no longer supported that's also fine for me.",1,"0"

"XORG-15546","Radeon: Omit mask coordinates","Created attachment 15964
Patch skipping mask coordinates

For the last week or so I've been chasing curiously bad glyph
drawing (and other compositing) performance on R300. The observed 
behavior was that we could draw ~72000 vertices / second (and
thus 18000 boxes / second) without regard to the size of the
triangles or how much setup we were doing around them. Some 
investigation revealed that the problem was apparently calculating 
vertex coordinates in the VAP for texture 1 without having a texture 1.

For glyph drawing before and after performance is:

                 before         after
String length    glyphs/sec     glyphs/sec

I also constructed a simpler benchmark that composited a
batch of N boxes of size MxM. (Using a clip region to 
get all the boxes in a batch drawn in a single go.)

(I hope bugzilla will not mangle the above tables)

The third column gives an idea of how much we can improve
further since it shows the same thing being done by the 
r300 3d driver which avoids the unnecessary repeated 
texture setup and cache flushing we are doing in the 2D
driver. We should be able to come close to the 1 million
glyph/sec mark for longer glyph strings of small characters.

The patch I'm attaching:

 - May not quite apply cleanly without the patches from
   bug 15371 but is independent.
 - Has only been tested on R300 not older or newer 
   cards. (I wanted to keep the coordinates we emitted
   the same everywhere though I suspect performance
   gains will be minimal elsewhere.)
 - Has only been tested for CP not MMIO

I don't think there will be any major problems on other
cards or MMIO but their might be typos or some register
that I forgot to adjust.",1,"0"

"WOCKY-30430","Make wocky_implement_finish_* macros safer","wocky_implement_finish_* macros have several issues that may lead to unsafe operations. As it is related I also notice that some cancellable are not handled properly.

1. _is_valid() is called after _propagate_error()

This is done this way because g_simple_async_report_in_idle() lakes a parameter for the source tag. This has been discussed with the GLib people and the best solution is not to use it. A exception to _is_valid() might be added but that would only come in the next cycle. Patch 001 removes the use of g_simple_async_report_in_idle() allowing _is_valid() to be called first as it's supposed. The advantage of such solution is that we don't force anybody into bumping to bleeding edge GLib.

2. Cancellable are not always reffed during the async calls

When cancelling a call it is correct to do g_cancellable_cancel(c) g_object_unref (c). Some of the async functions are not safe for that since they don't acquire a reference on the cancellable. Patch 002 fixes all the calls that where not doing proper ref/unref of cancellables.

3. The macro is missing scope

The macros are missing a scope (do { ... } while (0)) which is also used to force usage of  at the end of macro call. Patch 003 does that along with calling _is_valid() first and allowing g_object_unref to be a valid copy_func. g_object_unref does not support NULL as parameter.

"POPPLER-4649","crash on click on input field in PDF","= Transfering this bug from GNOME Bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=316907 =

Distribution: Debian testing/unstable
Package: evince
Severity: critical
Version: GNOME2.10.2 0.4.x
Gnome-Distributor: Debian
Synopsis: Crashes when trying to fill in text
Bugzilla-Product: evince
Bugzilla-Component: general
Bugzilla-Version: 0.4.x
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.10.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:
My credit card company sends me statements. There's a little text box
for me to fill in for how much I'm paying on my bill. When I tried to
click there evince crashed. The PDF is from Chase FYI.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. Open PDF from CC company
2. Try to fill in Amount Enclosed
3. Crash!

Expected Results:
CC company receives money and stops hounding me for more.

How often does this happen?
Very rarely I'm poor.

Additional Information:
Even though they say I need Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.1 can I use this as
an excuse for not paying my bill and get some kind of deference? -)

list of exported symbols

Version: 5.2.1

Attached is the list of symbols as exported by libxklavier.so.16.

From those 195 symbols 107 can not be found in the header files i.e. they are private.
Please consider hiding those private symbols.
A simple approach could be to use libtools symbols regex [1] like

-export-symbols-regex '^(xkl_.*|_xkl_debug)'

and then name the private symbols _xkl_*

I've included _xkl_debug as it seems to be exported in the API even if the name suggests otherwise.

X log since starting the X server - includes episodes of blanking due to openarena and google maps (under chrome)

As Paulo requested on https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94605 I'm opening a new bug to help collect information about the screen blanking 2 seconds when NUC6i5SYB connected via displayport to a monitor.

I'm sorry that I didn't see Eero Tamminen's (2016-08-22 14:30:37 UTC comment #49) comment until now:
> This sounds more like the X issues with DRI3 than kernel issue.
> Could you try both Intel DDX &modesetting X drivers and with

Yes I certainly can. But I need specific instructions on where to get the binaries or how to compile and install them locally. I'll try to follow the HOW TO FILE A BUG REPORT instructions linked in the component description field.

I do NOT see an i915 platform information field (as described by the HOW-TO).

> If it's indeed X issue please file separate bug about it.

I believe he is correct. Last year I reverted to older kernels (4.1 and 4.0) that did not previously exhibit this symptom and the symptom persisted. I believe this issue is rooted in user space and might be related to the display port output.

I'll also note that my NUC died late last year and was replaced under warranty by Intel (while there were issues with the return instructions and it took 6+ weeks to resolve everything it was taken care of - kudos to Intel support for their honest help with this). I'm reproducing the issue with the brand spank'n new HW just as frequently.

I do not see any GPU hangs FIFO overruns or other symptoms in my dmesg or /var/log/messages output.

I don't recall exactly when this symptom started but it was NOT occurring when I first purchased and used the NUC6i5SYB in Feb and March 2016. I believe it started after May 2016 (ie showed up in Debian testing - so bug could have been introduced earlier into dev source tree).

How to reproduce:
1) run openarena in 2560x1440
2) chrome browser: zoom/pan in Google maps when in earth mode (and HW accel is enabled)

"LIBREOFFICE-42520",": No uninstaller registration is made upon freshly installing v3.4.3 final","Problem description: -

No uninstall entry is found anywhere on the system after doing a clean install of LibreOffice v3.4.3. 

Either in the Programs & Features section of the Control Panel in Vista & Windows 7 (64 bit) or the Add/Remove Hardware of the older control panel in Windows XP there are no entries found for LibreOffice. 

There is no dedicated uninstaller application found in any of the directories created by LibreOffice.

Microsoft's Windows Installer Clean Up Utility which usually finds theses things does not list LibreOffice as installed on a Windows XP Vista or Windows 7 (64 bit) system.

There is no safe way for the end user to clear LibreOffice from the system in preparation for upgrade other than by using a system restore or re-imaging the system - which is most impractical especially if one wishes to do this some time after installing LibreOffice and having to roll back in time to a much earlier system state.

Please can an uninstaller be made for future version and can someone advise on the safest way I can test the complete removal of LibreOffice v3.4.3 in preparation for future upgraded of LibreOffice?


Steps to reproduce:
1. .... Install the latest version of LibreOffice on a clean system with no previous version of LibreOffice installed
2. .... Search for the uninstall entry in the Control Panel (Programs & Features or Add/Remove Software)
3. .... Search the LibreOffice directories for an uininstaller or use 3rd party uninstaller tools like Microsoft Install Clean Up Utility or CCleaner or jv16 Power Tools and find no entries for LibreOffice in any of them.

Current behaviour: Impossible to safely and thoroughly remove LibreOffice from a Windows system.

Expected behavior: To have a regular uninstall feature in the control panel to correctly and safely uninstall all aspects of LibreOffice.

"XORG-80470","Workaround for missing ABS_X/Y on multitouch devices","(Bug #64029 fixes the crash related to this.)

1)  The Kernel spec says multitouch devices should give ABS_X and ABS_Y events as well as ABS_MT_POSITION_X.  [http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2013-July/055823.html]

2)  Many drivers (maybe even most?) for Android devices don't give ABS_X.  I've personally played with Note 8 (synaptics_s7301 touchscreen driver) Nexus 5 (synaptics RMI4 drivder).  I've looked at several other drivers (various Atmel MaXTouch there is a mainline atmel_mxt_ts driver which does the right thing but seems devices often use older mxt224 drivers...).

3)  Its not clear if many drivers are destined for mainline (Android looks like a fragmented and horrid dev scene compared to GNU/Linux).  The device turnover is so fast.

4)  The cause here is probably the Android docs:

https://source.android.com/devices/tech/input/touch-devices.html#touch-device-classification

which suggest (or at least imply) its OK for multitouch to not give ABS_X.

5)  Fixing these upstream is a noble goal but difficult to have much impact---I've grabbed the cyanogenmod sources for my Note 8 and Nexus 5 with the thought to to look into doing this.  But even if I fix these two drivers it is not likely to reach many people.

6)  Its much easier to compile a new xf86-input-evdev than to recompile and replace an Android OS.  For example I have a standard Fedora 20 in a chroot on my devices which can talk to the framebuffer even with (essentially) the out-of-box OS (called ROM in Android community)...  Pen works great just no touchscreen b/c of this.

----------------------

Given the above I think it might be more pragmatic to work around the the ABS_X issue.  We could still give a (WW) warning (instead of an error) pointing out its contrary to kernel spec.

I'm hopeful that such a workaround would involve changes only to evdev.c. Please advise if you think that's not the case (so I can decide whether to tackle this or 5) above).",182,"1"

The same set up works on two of my older systems (i86-32 with older Radeon AGP cards) with the same X server (from the xserver-xorg-video-radeon package) so I am not certain whether the problem is with the X server the 3D acceleration libgl1-mesa-glx or compiz.

"POPPLER-46744","[patch] pdftops git 29feb12 -passfonts regression","Created attachment 57789
patch against poppler cloned from git on 29Feb12

When a PDF references a non-embedded font the git version of pdftops ignores -passfonts and attempts to embed an external font.

This is a regression from 0.18.4 on two counts.

First when pdftops embeds the font it creates a font with the name referenced in the pdf even if it embeds a substitute.  This makes the generated EPS file misleading because pre-flight scans of the EPS won't generate warnings about missing fonts but the file will print incorrectly even if the printer has the correct font.

Second even if pdftops embeds a font with the same name the font might be different for example the Linux system running pdftops might have a low quality free font while the printer might have a high quality commercial font.

In addition I have a workflow with a lot of little files that all use a small number of fonts.  For a sample 2326 byte PDF pdftops 0.18.4 generated a 18080 byte EPS while the new git version generates a 1157015 byte EPS over 60X as large due to the embedded font (which happens to be a substitution anyway).  I have to build PS pages that each contain several hundred of these files and all of the extra copies of the font add up.

It seems like someone tried to replace psSubstFonts with psFontPassthrough in GlobalParams but pdftops.cc sets psSubstFonts while GfxFont.cc tests psFontPassthrough.  I made the smallest change to get -passfonts working which was restoring GlobalParams::getPSSubstFonts() and testing globalParams->getPSSubstFonts() in GfxFont::locateFont().  This restores the behavior of 0.18.4 (and previous versions).

These .type directives are expanded from the GLOBL_FN macro in the same
file:

#define GLOBL_FN(x) GLOBL x  .type x function

However the actual type specifier following the comma should normally
be preceded by an '@' character.  For reference see the binutils
documentation about the .type directive here:

  http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Type.html

Most of the other .S files in Mesa also use an '@' character so I would
like to propose to do the same here for portability between assemblers.
Since this particular .S file seems to be generated from gl_x86_asm.py
I have also updated that script to match.",1,"0"

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/854986

[Problem]
Output probing is traced to causing a multi-second delay during boot.

Some experimentation by the reporter and others seeing same/similar issues show that by forcing off disconnected outputs the boot speed is significantly improved.

[Original Report]
I've been looking at our session startup time this week and I've got one of the big delays right down already (bug 854101). However the next biggest offender is Xorg (when starting a 2d session) - there appears to be a ~5s delay between Xorg starting and the greeter loading.

You can see this in the bootchart attached.

Looking at the timestamps in my Xorg.0.log shows a pretty big delay just here:

[ 15.583] (II) intel(0): Initializing HW Cursor
[ 18.030] (II) intel(0): RandR 1.2 enabled ignore the following RandR disabled message.

18 seconds matches up perfectly on the bootchart with the lightdm greeter starting.

Drop duplicate Malay (Jawi) entry

The fix of  added the Indonesian (Jawi) keyboard layout via the symbols file id. Two additional symbols files - my and bn - where added which both load the just mentioned layout and they both have the name Malay (Jawi).

The list of input sources includes:

Indonesian (Jawi)
Malay (Jawi)
Malay (Jawi)

One of the Malay (Jawi) items is apparently redundant so I'd suggest that the bn symbols file is dropped.

Besides being redundant the presence of the bn symbols file confuses the ibus-avro tool for typing Bangla/Bengali please see . While the latter is probably a bug in ibus-avro dropping the duplicate entry in xkb-data serves the purpose of working around that conflict for now.",13,"0"
"XORG-3449","A short warning on the X11 Editres protocol","As seen on bugtraq from Florian Weimer :

The xterm manual page contains a strongly worded warning about the
allowSendEvents configuration option:

| allowSendEvents (class AllowSendEvents)
|    Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events
|    (generated using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be
|    interpreted or discarded.  The default is ‘‘false’’ meaning they
|    are discarded.  Note that allowing such events creates a very
|    large security hole.  The default is ‘‘false.’’

However xterm is an Xt application and therefore speaks a
long-forgotten protocol called Editres.  As a result any Editres
client (such as editres) can instruct an xterm window to change its
allowSendEvents setting.  After that it's possible to send
synthesized events to the xterm window and hijack the terminal.

Other Xt applications may have similar issues.  If an application is
SUID or SGID and does not drop privileges early in the startup
process a privilege escalation vulnerability might exist (but it's
probably easier to exploit it by providing carefully constructed
resource settings from the beginning).

I'm not sure that the author of the paragraph was right to label this
as a security hole certainly it's just a minor one.  However the
xterm documentation should be updated.  (A previous attempt to resolve
this issue quietly had failed.)",122,"0"

    make: Make util libraries shared in non-windows systems
    
    Incremental builds take long time linking tests if utilities are
    modified. The link time can be eliminate if libraries are made shared.
    
    Shared libraries need to specify symbols that are excepted to be
    declared in executeable as weak to allow linking without symbols that
    aren't used in runtime.
    
    Windows has limitation that shared library can't have programs main
    function that forces windows to use static libraries.

"DRI-108981","Kernel 4.19 won't boot with amdgpu (black screen) for some video cards","I'm running into a major issue which seems to have been introduced with Kernel 4.19.1 and later (did not occur in 4.18.5). My OS is openSUSE Tumbleweed x64 with the last working snapshot being 20181112.

My machine refuses to boot and remains stuck at a black screen after issuing the boot command in grub2. The HDD led flashes a few times shortly after grub2 disappears but after that it will stay off and nothing new happens. I cannot use control + alt + fN to switch to a different runlevel either however I'm still able to toggle the NumLock / CapsLock leds which means the system isn't freezing up entirely. The computer won't respond to the power button and has to be restarted via the reset button.

The issue is specific to the amdgpu module: Kernel 4.19 will boot successfully if using the radeon and not amdgpu driver. I'm able to load it after removing the following parameters from my Kernel command line:

radeon.si_support=0 radeon.cik_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 amdgpu.cik_support=1

I can confirm that the problem is video card specific: My mother's computer also uses openSUSE Tumbleweed and has the latest snapshot as well as the same kernel parameters for amdgpu. For her there are absolutely no issues when booting with 4.19. I'm pondering whether this Kernel introduces an issue in amdgpu which affects GCN 2.0 video cards explicitly.

My affected video card is a Radeon R9 390 8GB (GCN 2.0). My mother's working video card is a Radeon R7 370 2GB (GCN 1.0).",2,"0"

This is of course easy to change but Mesa 3D uses it to check whether AGP DMA
has been initialized and if  not uses the PCI path. 

Either a separate user-callable IOCTL that checks wether AGP DMA has been
initialized is needed or a check for caller privileges is needed for
VIA_INIT_DMA and VIA_CLEANUP_DMA functions whereas VIA_DMA_INITIALIZED should
be allowed as normal user.

Suggestions are appreciated.

"SYSTEMD-84689","Failed to determine block device of root file system: No such file or directory on boot","Created attachment 107360
The test program which reproduces bug in systemd-gpt-auto-generator

I boot without initrd my root partition is btrfs on GPT. At boot I see the following message:

systemd-gpt-auto-generator[84]: Failed to determine block device of root file system: No such file or directory

And systemd-gpt-auto-generator fails with error code 1.

I've made some debugging and found out that in function get_btrfs_block_device() (in file src/gpt-auto-generator/gpt-auto-generator.c) on line 633 we try to stat /dev/root but /dev/root does not exist at the moment and it leads to failure:

if (stat((char*) di.path &st) < 0)

If someone runs this code when booting with initrd it stats /dev/sda2 and runs successfully. But when I boot without initrd my root filesystem is shown in /etc/mtab as /dev/root (instead of /dev/sda2) because it was mounted from kernel (not from userspace like in case of initrd) and systemd=gpt-auto-generator fails.

Also if someone runs this code after fsck'ing and remounting root it also runs successfully because after remount root filesystem is shown as /dev/sda2 in /etc/mtab.

I'm attaching a test program it contains two functions copied from systemd (get_block_device and get_btrfs_block_device) with some debug output added. When I run it as init it shows the following:

/dev/root on / type btrfs (rorelatimespace_cache)

And when I run in from booted system (after remounting /) it shows the following:

"TELEPATHY-34091","Allow TpSimplePasswordManager to be used with custom channels","In bug #33485 I proposed an additional interface for SASLAuthentication channels that would allow the client to indicate to the CM whether the password should be cached in the CM.  If the channel implemented this additional interface it would no longer be possible to use TpSimplePasswordManager since the channel itself is completely hidden from the API user.  So I propose to modify the password manager API in a couple ways to allow the user to specify custom channels to be used with the password manager:
- expose the TpSimplePasswordChannel class as public API that can be used as a base class
- Add an alternative to tp_simple_password_manager_prompt_async() that takes a channel as a parameter.

"XORG-12597","Matrox G550: text mode not restored.","Hi!

after grumbling a long time about Debian bug no. 324500 (with another nod to Michel and all those who felt like him on my latest contribution.  He was right.) which is essentially #615 (and I'm now also hit by #4015 making my head ache on using a high resolution with 60Hz on the better display...)

Anyway... Opening a new bug here because the problem does not exactly match what went before.  The new problem is: after configuring the basic X server automatically (the Debian way dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg) I get working X on the primary screen with a resolution supported by the smaller screen while the smaller screen is blank.  (Not necessarily #4015 might just be clone mode and the initialisation of the 2nd screen missing.  See last bit of #615 which probably is not in the Debian packages I guess.)  Exiting X or trying to switch to a text console with Ctrl+Alt+Fn works fine in software but doesn't restore the screen to text mode (fluffy bit at the top of the screen looks like some funny bit patterns are written to the framebuffer).  I can however work normally (if blindly) even switching back to X works (screen comes back).

"XORG-1952","Pivot functions slow","Sorry if this is in the wrong category please move in the case.

The X.org pivot is extremely slow. (rotate CCW function) 

I understand that for it to work really well one needs
- A gfx card that accelerates rotation on hardware
- Drivers supporting the feature on the gfx card

For instance my card doesn't afaik have hardware acceleration for the function.
One has to fallback to software rotation. Xrandr rotation doesn't work on Linux
it seems. The usual i8xx drivers do not seem to support rotation.

I seem to have to fallback to vesafb (i8xxfb doesn't support my chip) and then
CCW it. It's extremely slow. When enabling the rotation it takes 2-3 seconds to
redraw the complete screen.

I did some more digging on the matter. It seems there aren't viable gfx card
options available that would do the thing really well on hardware (not even
ati/nvidia they would lose all the other acceleration).

I mean duh? Is some works underway to correct this issue? Using pivot is a must
for instance reading documents (on a large monitor you get 1:1 paper size and
even larger very nice to read a whole page at the time etc) and for page
layouting and such. 

I know it's hard to get gfx card vendors to support more stuff but how about
giving us a usably performing software solution that would do it with all the cards?

(I don't mean to troll but I have to make a side note: the same hardware and on
Windows the software rotation they do it quite fast and usably. It proves it is
possible.)",503,"1"

"MESA-37541","Clearing depth buffer prevents swap buffers from updating drawable when running compiz","Created attachment 47098
A small example reproducing the bug

The attached simple GLX example shows the problem updates are simply blocked when running the compiz window manager (tested on Ubuntu 10.10). If another window from another application is updating the window also updates.

A bisect shows that a82a43e8d99e1715dd11c9c091b5ab734079b6a6 is the root cause.

System mesa: 
Mesa DRI Intel(R) Sandybridge Desktop GEM 20100330 DEVELOPMENT

2.1 Mesa 7.11-devel (git-7f7b697)

I'd like to produce periodic doxygen documentation of Mesa from a cron job inside shell.freedesktop.org. However I'm missing the following software:
- doxygen
- graphviz

"MODEMMANAGER-102231","MBIM modem failing with MaxActivatedContexts after suspend/resume cycle","Aleksander and I discussed this on IRC but I'm logging a bug too to make sure it doesn't get forgotten about.

My HP lt4120 modem (in MBIM mode) will after a suspend/resume cycle no longer be able to connect:

[root@sloth ~]# mmcli -m 28 --simple-connect=apn=telenor.smart
error: couldn't connect the modem: 'GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.libmbim.Error.Status.MaxActivatedContexts: MaxActivatedContexts'

The modem was in all likelihood connected when the machine was suspended (as the WWAN connection in NM has connection.autoconnect: yes).

Even though the modem isn't connected from MM/NM's point of view from the MBIM point of view it appears to be:

[root@sloth ~]# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --query-connection-state
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Connection status:
              Session ID: '0'
        Activation state: 'activated'
        Voice call state: 'none'
                 IP type: 'ipv4-and-ipv6'
            Context type: 'internet'
           Network error: 'unknown'

I can bring it back to life by using mbimcli to disconnect it:

[root@sloth ~]# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --disconnect
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Successfully disconnected
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Connection status:
              Session ID: '0'
        Activation state: 'deactivated' 
        Voice call state: 'none' 
                 IP type: 'default'
            Context type: 'internet'
           Network error: 'unknown'
[root@sloth ~]# mmcli -m 28 --simple-connect=apn=telenor.smart
successfully connected the modem

It would be nice if MM gains the ability to do this on its own at suspend or resume time (or both).

"LIBREOFFICE-43424",": LO Crashes while Comparing an Empty Document with Another Document","PLO crashes when I tried accidentally to compare an empty document with a chapter of the LO Writer manual. 

In order to reproduce:

[1] Download Chapter 1 of the LibreOffice Writer Guide and save it to your computer. I used  the version for branch 3.4.x. (http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Publications)
[2] Start LO.
[3] Open a new text document.
[4] From the menu: Edit > Compare Document...
[5] Select the file saved at step [1]. With my ancient Computer I have to wait some seconds then LO crashes.

3 hints:
- LO does not crash when I added a single character to the new document.
- LO does not crash when I compared the empty file with some documents I created. 
- After the crash a recovery is successful.

Actual result:

If you do it the other way round (install dbus run dbus-uuidgen --ensure install systemd run systemd-machine-id-setup) then it works as expected: we generate a D-Bus machine ID then systemd-machine-id-setup just copies it.

"XORG-27430","distorted display with Dell U2711 monitor with xserver-xorg-video-ati","Created attachment 34624
lspci -vvnn output

Gets distorted display with a Dell U2711 using the KMS enabled xorg server that comes with Ubuntu Lucid (10.04).

The distortion is such that fonts are rendered almost unreadable (beside that the outline is distorted they have a heavy red tint to them). It seems like that everything gets overlayed with a kind of sawtooth like pattern which distort everyhing including fonts borders on windows and edges in images and such.

The distortion is not present in screenshots.

The distortion seems to be there all the way from boot and up. That is the ubuntu logo with progress bar displayed during boot also displays the same distortion.

When using a different monitor that is a Dell 2005FPW monitor the distortion is all gone. (The U2711 uses dual channel DVI - 2560x1440 resolution while the 2005FPW monitor uses single channel - 1680x1050 resoultion.)

The ATI fglrx driver (ver. 2:8.721-0ubuntu7) works fine with the U2711 monitor (but calculates the DPI wrong - gets 96 while it should be 109 for this monitor).

The videocard is a Radeon HD 4550 card (RV710 chip).

Have tested with the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver that comes with Ubuntu Lucid the driver from ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa (ver. 1:6.12.192+git20100401.6baa96c4-0ubuntu0sarvatt) and with bleeding edge (buildt according to instructions given at http://www.x.org/wiki/radeonBuildHowTo).

From the general discussion around such issues and the KernelModeSettings found on the net I have gotten the understanding that parts of the Xorg driver code now resides in the kernel and it could therefore be that the problem resides there and not in the xserver-xorg-video-ati/radeon driver. Have used the standard kernel (currently 2.6.32-19) that comes with Ubuntu Lucid all the way as I have not found out how to update the KMS parts in the kernel with newer versions (pointers are most welcome). Tried with a 2.6.33 kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.33/ but this kernel gave no change (is from february and the KMS part might therefore not be up to date).",204,"1"

"TELEPATHY-24273","Add a proxy mode preventing MC parting channels when the UI crashes.","When the channel dispatcher notices that the handler for a channel has crashed it's supposed to call Close() on the channel. This works well for 1-1 text channels (which respawn) and just about every other type of channel (which stay dead) but for chat rooms this is undesirable. If you're using Idle through a proxy (or arguably at all) you don't want all your IRC channels to be parted because your UI crashed.

The best solution seems to be to make Close() not leave the IRC channel but make it respawn and rely on RemoveMembers([self] ...) to leave channels. We can't unilaterally make this change because it breaks the semantics of Close() — UIs need to be altered to use RemoveMembers() ­— so a boolean on the account to opt-in seems like a good way. But this can't ever be removed for backwards-compatibility reasons...

"XORG-34806","vertical scrolling and tapping behave differently with kernel 2.6.32 vs 2.6.37","Created attachment 43899
logfile after repair with 42-synaptics.conf applied

Hi first time bug-reporter here...

Submitted this report at bugs.debian.org first #615582 but they (KiBi) suggested to report it here instead. Here goes:

Sid saw a kernel upgrade from 2.6.32 to 2.6.37 two weeks ago
(?). Since then the touchpad on my Acer Travelmate 8571 doesn't work
as before: the vertical scroll action sometimes works for one stroke
and then doesn't respond anymore. Single-tapping doesn't reliably
generate TapButton1 events but most often TapButton3.
After booting back into kernel 2.6.32 everything is fine again.

Using synclient -l after booting one or the other kernel I find different settings:

I have no /etc/X11/xorg.conf i.e. all settings are read from
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf:

Section InputClass
        Identifier touchpad catchall
        Driver synaptics
        MatchIsTouchpad on
EndSection

The surprising finding (to me) was in /var/log/Xorg.o.log. 

for kernel 2.6.32
(--) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: x-axis range 1472 - 5472
(--) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: y-axis range 1408 - 4448

whereas for kernel 2.6.37
(--) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: x-axis range 1472 - 5628
(--) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: y-axis range 1408 - 4928
  

So the big question is: how are these different touchpad sizes probed?
I guess that the differnces reported by synclient are follow-up errors.
Manually setting the values back to what they were with 2.6.32
restores the desired behaviour. (e.g synclient RightEdge 5192) 
Or more permanenty by creating a conf file:

$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/42-synaptics.conf
Section InputClass
    Identifier touchpad tweaked catchall
    MatchIsTouchpad on
    Driver synaptics
    Option LeftEdge 1752
    Option RightEdge 5192
    Option MaxTapMove 221
    Option EmulateTwoFingerMinW 7
    Option PalmMinWidth 10
EndSection
 
Any help / advice appreciated!

HD3850 Xorg log

On both X1600pro and HD3850 AGPs switching VT or quitting X will result in a blank but functioning VGA console CRT monitor will go into standby.

Does not happen with radeonhd/vesa/fglrx drivers.

On the X1600 switching back to the X VT would revive the monitor - this does not work with the HD3850.

Running the vesa driver first totally fixed the problem for the X1600 but although it fixes the vga console on switch/quit for the HD3850 it does not fix the loss of display when switching back to X with   .

The monitor goes in and out of dpms standby OK with both cards.

bash-3.2$ dmesg | grep -i vga
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25

I guess means I am not using any vesa/radeonfb.

If I connect svideo TV out on the HD3850 I do not loose that display when the monitor is not displaying console.",607,"1"

Reproducing steps: Update the intel driver from 2.8.1 to 2.9.0 and try to start the X server

Expected result: a running X server

Actual result: The screen goes black for a moment and then returns to  text console

Additional info:
Kernel mode setting is not activated. I have also tried with kernel mode setting activated. This did not work either.

I have identified the code change which leads to the regression:

Lines 1827 - 1829 in file i830_sdvo.c:
/* when there is no EDID it should be detected as disconnected */
if (!edid_mon)
    return XF86OutputStatusDisconnected

If I comment out these lines the X server starts up again and is normally usable. I cannot switch back to the text console though. The monitor then reports Out of range.

Picture of an artifact

Hi

There are some black shaped artifacts occuring over window on gnome-shell.
I managed to record a video and extract an image displaying such an artifact.

This bug is not deterministic however it is very frequent : to make it appears I only moved a terminal window on the bottom edge of the screen.

Note that this bug is not specific to gnome-shell it also appears on kwin effect in kde and in others circumstance in gnome-shell but the scenario described above is the easiest to reproduce.

My hardware is AMD Zacate E350 (evergreen based) using Mesa 7.11 rc1 (bug is also in 7.10.x) on opensuse 11.4 64bits(is also on Fedora 15) with r600g drivers libdrm 2.4.26 and ati ddx 14.2 kernel 2.6.39.

* GroupsChanged([the group] added: [...] removed: [])
* NewChannels(the group)

In 0.20.3 and 0.20.1 we removed the second emission of NewChannels

add hash check for outlines section numbers

If the definition of an outlines section in a document is broken and /Next references contain a loop libpoppler will follow this blindly and become stuck in a loop of its own.

The broken documents I found had sections arranged like:
24 /First 25 ... /Type/Outlines
25 /Next 51 ...
27 /Next 28 ...
28 /Next 52 ...
29 /Next 27 ...

50 /Next 49 ...
51 /Next 50 ...
52 /Next 51 ...

I assume that the same bug could be triggered with just two Outlines sections.

Attached is a patch that fixes this issue but I have no experience with the workflow and coding practises of the poppler project so it may not suit the authors.

This issue applies to v0.8.7 and earlier.  The patch is valid for this version and also applies cleanly to 0.5.9

The patch works by adding a hash of outline section numbers visited.  If a number appears again the loop is exited.",119,"0"

Sass is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) pre-processor. The reference implementation is written in Ruby and available from:
http://sass-lang.com/

Sass has two syntaxes. The first is known as Sassy CSS (SCSS) and has the .scss file extension. The second older syntax is known as the indented syntax and has the .sass file extension. See:
http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html

Sass files can be used by a wide range of IDE tools e.g. gnome-code-assistance gtksourceview Atom NetBeans:

From what I can see the docs for 3DSTATE_WM_HZ_OP say: As this command generates an implicit rectangle SW must make sure any MMIO register writes following WM_HZ_OP must be preceded by PIPE_CONTROL with Command Streamer Stall Enable bit set.

In the code there's a following PIPECONTROL with depth_stall and depth flush bits set which corresponds to the docs in the section 'Depth Buffer Clear'.

"LIBREOFFICE-63141","Spanish translation replaces Heading (Encabezado) with Header (Encabezamiento)","Created attachment 77459
ODT example created with LibO 3.5.7

Since LibO 3.6 all headings of my files saved with prior LibO version looked smaller. It still happens with LibO 4.0

I could not realize what was happening until today that I downloaded LibO 4.0.2 and didn't use the translated UI.
I will try to describe the problem carefully attaching a ODT file and 3 screenshots.

System: Kubuntu 12.04 with LibO 3.5.7 installed from repositories

Description:
The first screenshot shows a file created with LibO 3.5.7 installed from Kubuntu repos. All formating is done through styles.
So the header has a the Header style (translated as Encabezamiento en LibO 3.5 and prior) headings has their conrresponding Heading styles (Encabezados) and so for bodytext. 

The styles used in this file are:
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 14 pts
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 16.1 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: 9 pts

The second screenshot shows this file opened with LibO 4 without the spanish translation. It shows a correct formating of the file with exactly the same styles as defined in files saved with LibO 3.5.

The third screenshot shows the same file opened with LibO 4 but having already installed the translated UI.
Now the styles has become
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 9 pts (as was Header)
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 10.3 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: doesn't exist


So the problem is that the spanish translation is using Header in place of Heading. When saving this file with LibO 4 with spanish UI opening with Lib 3.5 looks also wrong with the modified styles.",178,"1"

With sabayon 3.4e (64 bits version live dvd mode) the app starts and after five seconds the whole system freeze. Obviously the same happens with 3d desktop with both xgl and aiglx (the desktop without acceleration works OK) and also here I need to shut down the system by holding the power button.

2) add Virtual 1024x768 line in xorg.conf

I think a possible work-around for this (at least for vlan interfaces) would be to find the parent based on MAC address.  This is arguable a problem with kernel sysfs tree:

[Problem]
X freeze triggered by Klondike Solitaire on 945G graphics on ASUSTeK Computer.

[Discussion]


The X system crashed while playing Solitaire Aisleriot.

Ubuntu 8.10 all packages upgraded as of today 15-11-2008.

Solitaire froze while dragging a card. Then the display disappeared. I saw a dialogue box about a safe mode or something I didn't have the time to read even less to click OK. I didn't get safe mode or any other mode working. Neither Ctrl+Alt+F1 or Alt+F1 worked to log in in another terminal and emit a shutdown. I had to reset the computer.
This is the third time I think since I upgraded to 8.10 Intrepid. It never happened before. I do not know whether the problem lies with /usr/games/sol or with the X system (or gdm). (I do now I was playing Solitaire also on the second crash. I do not remember for the first one.) Anyway it is extremely serious because one could be running something important in the background but it was impossible to regain control of the system without a reset.

"XORG-987","XV viewport effect with multiple heads with different resolutions","Hi 
 
Apologies if this is in the wrong category I couldn't find anything xv specific so I picked on the driver 
instead. 
 
I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 with on board ATI Mobility 7500 graphics.  Works great with the radeon 
driver using DRM but xv overlays won't expand to full screen when outputting to my external 
monitor at 1280x1024. 
 
It's very difficult to describe...the video -appears- to be stretching to the full screen but I get a kind of 
viewport effect where I get a box (I am guessing its 1024x768 in size roughly) and if I move the 
box around I can move the viewport and see parts of the movie that are hidden. 
 
If the movie isn't full screen and I have say xine at the top of the screen and I move the mouse to 
the bottom of the screen some of the video that's playing is hidden. 
 
If you can tell me how to do screenshots of overlayed stuff I'll show you what I mean...I hope I've 
described it properly. 
 
Laptop display panel runs at 1024x768 external output is set at 1280x1024.",931,"1"
"MESA-89891","Outlast segfault on new game","Created attachment 114851
backtrace with git version

lsThe game Outlast (from the latest Humble Indie Bundle) segfaults when a new game is launched.

With Mesa 10.4.2 I get a segfault in ir_assignment::ir_assignment.

With current git I get a radeon: mmap failed errno: 12 and a segfault in __memcpy_ssse3.


Another problem is that the game takes ages to start about 90 seconds from start to menu. Most of this time is spent compiling more than 18000 shaders so maybe that's just a problem with the game.

"XORG-18479","VPATH build for viewres xfd xgc xmh and xsm fails","Created attachment 20208
patch for viewres

These five apps copy e.g. app-defaults/Viewres.ad to app-defaults/Viewres but don't ensure that the directory ./app-defaults exists. Thus a VPATH build (objdir != srcdir) will fail.

Historically in the monolithic build Viewres.ad was installed as Viewres by a suitable imake rule. The reason for this certainly was the fact that an executable viewres and an app default file Viewres cannot coexist on a case insensitive filesystem.

For the modular build automake requires (sort of) to create a file Viewres that will then be installed. In order to cope with case insensitive filesystems that is now done in a subdirectory app-defaults. This however allows to distribute the app default files under their final names no need to copy them no need to ensure the existence of ./app-defaults.

Moreover defining them as dist_appdefault_DATA avoids the necessity to mention them under EXTRA_DIST. All this simplifies Makefile.am considerably.

Attached are five small patches along these lines for the five apps mentioned above.",16,"0"

Small patch to correct typo in Git-commit 4083197a44d1a1a05d33654b3c7d6e96d7472fe7

Hi

The current git-code has a small typo which makes hardware-accelerated OpenGL on 8xx-based chipsets impossible :

- info.driverName = IS_I965G(intel) ? i965 : i915
+ info.driverName = IS_GEN3(intel) ? i915 : i965

The order of the names was changed and now the module i965_dri.so is loaded for 8xx-based chipsets and i915_dri.so for 9xx based and newer chipsets.

Greetings

Description of problem:

3 out of 5 times if my laptop (T460p) is connected to external display via display port and I reboot the machine then after login screen the desktop is completely frozen. Also while the desktop/display is frozen - I am able to SSH to the machine remotely and do my stuff. I have gathered journalctl and dmesg logs via remote SSH when this happened. 

My laptop (Thinkpad T460p) although has Nvidia card - I have noveou module blacklisted and I always use integrated intel graphics.  My external display is a AOC 4K monitor connected via display port.

user-defined dictionary to reproduce the bug

The deletion of words from a user-defined dictionary does not work properly using the UI given at Tools > Options > Language Settings > Writinge Aids.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1) Go to Writing Aids
2) Create a new Dictionary (e.g. with the name test all languages)
3) Edit test
4) Add the words zappy and xappy
5) Hit Close hit OK. test.dic now looks this way:

OOoUserDict1
lang: 
type: positive
---
xappy
zappy

6) Reopen Writing Aids
7) Remove xappy
8) Hit Close hit OK. test.dic now looks this way:

OOoUserDict1
lang: 
type: positive
---
zappy
zappy

ANOTHER EXAMPLE
This bug also applies to already existing user dictionaries. Deleting a randaom word from the attached dictionary ends at some confusion around the last few lines. Before:
   ...
   Özdogan
   Özdogans
   äsopische
After deleting the entry Agamben (hit Close and OK) the file ending looks like this:
   ...
   Özdogan
   Özdogans
   äsopische
   opische
After deleting another entry (for this example Ahasveros hit Close and OK) seems to corrupt the file totally. After that for some reasons my plain text editor does not recognize anymore that the file is UTF8-encoded (also another line has been added):
   ...
   Ãzdogan
   Ãzdogans
   Ã€sopische
   €sopische
   opische",486,"1"

"POPPLER-105772","[PATCH] Arthur support for Type3 fonts","Created attachment 138383
Patch that prevents 'startPage' to fill the page with white color

I implemented type3 font support in the Arthur backend loosely following what the Cairo backend does.  It's a prototype and needs more testing but unfortunately I have only a few documents with type3 fonts.

I'll upload two patches:
1) The first removes code that made the startPage method fill the page with white color.  It is unclear why this code existed at all.  For type3 fonts it is problematic because then glyphs can have a white background rather than a transparent one.

2) The actual implementation.  It is as short as I could make it but the result is not as pretty as could be.  For example there are now two separate caches for type3 fonts and other fonts.  I think the best would be to introduce an abstract ArthurFont base class and an ArthurFontEngine.cc file similar to what the Cairo backend does.  I'll promise to provide this as a separate cleanup patch once the type3 support has been merged.",15,"0"

[Problem]
X crash in EvdevMBEmuBlockHandler() seen in Jaunty and Karmic (with -evdev 2.2.2).  Occurs rarely with no obvious/known steps to reproduce.

[Original Report]

I wasn't doing anything new the time this program crashed. The screen went blank for a few seconds with some vertical colored strands crossing here and there Then a command-line display came up with a few error messages. The system then went to the login window. From there everything worked fine. I have a feeling that this happened because I'm putting too much pressure on my machine. At the time I was having wuala transmission firefox xchat working. And by the way this is not the first time this crash happened but I didn't get the crash report in previous crashed because I've rebooted the system right after it happened.

[Original Report]
This is with the Gutsy daily desktop CD for amd64 from 2007/10/10.

Apps like gdm and gnome-panel put their bottom parts e.g. the bottom gnome-panel instance and the gdm button area about 2/3 to the bottom. I've attached some screenshots of this behavior. I couldn't figure it out until I went to the Screen and Graphics Preferences tool. It is autodecting a resolution of 1280x800 when the LCD screen is actually a normal 1280x1024 19 LCD. When I typed 'xrandr -q' I got:

Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200 current 1280 x 1024 maximum 1280 x 1200
VGA-0 connected 1280x800 0 0 (normal left inverted right) 0mm x 0mm
   1280x800 60.0*
   1280x768 60.0
   1024x768 60.0
   800x600 60.3
   640x480 59.9
DVI-0 connected 1280x1024 0 0 (normal left inverted right) 359mm x 287mm
   1280x1024 60.0* 59.9
   1024x768 75.1 60.0
   800x600 75.0 60.3
   640x480 75.0 60.0
   720x400 70.1

It seems as if GNOME apps assume that the screen is 1280x800 even though nothing is actually plugged into the VGA port. Once I dragged the panel down to the bottom it stays their across sessions. The other apps like gdm still have the odd behavior. The screenshots [in the downstream bug report] demonstrate this better than I can describe.

 * * *

I tried the latest Intrepid release and was able to boot the machine. It was more successful though still not correct.

The display came up in 1152x864 which on a 19 LCD was stretched. I went to System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution and 1280x1024 wasn't in the Resolution list. Mirror Screens was checked (though I only had the LCD plugged into DVI and nothing in the VGA) so I unchecked it. This caused the Resolution list to refresh so I chose 1280x1024. I hit Apply and it said it would write out the configuration and that I'd have to logout for the new configuration to take effect. I logged out and saw the gdm login screen which didn't seem quite optimal so I hit Control-Alt-Backspace to really restart X but it didn't look different.

When I logged in the bottom panel was at the very top of the screen and the desktop background was... hard to describe. It was as if someone took the smudge tool to the regular intrepid background and made long straight vertical streaks going from top to bottom. I managed to start a terminal and looked at the xorg.conf the previous step had created. It had written a Virtual size of 1280x1888 instead of 1280x1024. I manually edited this logged out hit Control-Alt-Backspace and logged in.

The resolution came up in 1152x864 again. I decided to try 'xrandr'. As in the xrandr output at the very top of this bug it believed I had a display attached to the VGA port when there wasn't anything plugged into it. I looked through 'xrandr -h' and invoked

  xrandr --output VGA-0 --off
  xrandr --output DVI-0 --preferred

and voila the screen changed to 1280x1024. I'm just guessing that the GNOME apps are relying on the xrandr information which is incorrect since there is no VGA attached though the xrandr mechanism thinks it is and uses it as the primary display. Perhaps this bug should be retitled?

So far they've worked great with the RadeonHD 1.1 drivers until we went to an extended desktop and started using them full time. On all of our machines the right display (i.e. second display) has a weird flicker problem. Every few minutes horizontal black lines will randomly flash quickly across the screen and maybe once an hour the screen completely looses its signal for about a second and then comes back on.

I've ruled out the monitors or the videocard/workstation at this point. Also the fact that it happens on all the machines leads me to believe its a driver issue not faulty hardware. Using the same monitors and RadeonHD release on my X1650 AGP in an older workstation never exhibited the problem once. I'm guessing it's this particular chipset or maybe the fact that it's dual DVI out. The AGP card without the problem is VGA/DVI.

The issue is always in the secondary port. From xrandr:

DVI-I_2/digital connected 1920x1200+1920+0 519mm x 324mm
  1920x1200      60.0*+ 

I've been looking at Bug #13853 and it seems similar but I'm not experiencing the  permanent loss of signal it always returns immediately. Also I'm using xorg-x11-drv-radeonhd-1.1.0-0.6.20080216git.fc8 which is supposedly built after the fixes in #13853 were applied so it must be a separate or related issue.

This is the corresponding entry in my apache log:

As you can see this simple two-way synchronization consumes 26Mb while the ics file of the calendar is 300kb.

This is of course highly inefficient and also makes SyncEvolution almost unusable to me because synchronization now takes 6 minutes (due to low upload bandwith of my server).

SyncEvolution 1.4 was much more efficient in this respect and was doing the synchronization in a couple of seconds.

Any idea how to fix this? Is there a simple workaround that I could apply?

"TELEPATHY-29728","ContactManager::addGroup and removeGroup are confusing/broken","ContactManager::addGroup is described as Attempt to add an user-defined contact list group. Therefore (and judging from the naming) one would expect that after the returned PendingOperation has finished successfully the group would have actually been added (I know right?) and would be usable for eg. adding contacts to it.

In reality however the PendingOperation finishes as soon as the underlying EnsureChannel D-Bus call to the CM has returned. While this is indeed when the group is actually added at the CM level at this point the ContactManager internals still haven't picked up the new group and for example trying to add a contact to the seemingly newly-added group fails! A work-around is to wait for the groupAdded signal for the group in question - but this is really error-prone as the signal may well have been emitted already (and will be if we fix this bug properly)!

The fix would be to make a private PendingOperation subclass which would first make the EnsureChannel call and if that's successful and the new group hasn't been picked up yet wait for the new group to be picked up (by the groupAdded() signal) before finishing. Then the operation being finished() would truly mean that the group is now usable by the usual methods manipulating it.

Similarly the removeGroup PendingOperation returns as soon as the Channel's Close method has returned (and the group has been removed from the server). However contacts can still seemingly be added to the group etc. until the channel being invalidated is picked up by the ContactManager internals and groupRemoved() is emitted (probably in the next few mainloop iterations)! This is less of a problem though as you generally shouldn't need to worry about a removed group anymore - it's still confusing however as the PendingOperation to eg. add a contact to a group in this state will probably fail with The method AddMembers on bahbah interface doesn't exist (because the Channel doesn't exist anymore) instead of the intended The group doesn't exist.

The fix for this then is obviously waiting for groupRemoved in the removeGroup PendingOperation if the group still exists in the ContactManager internals after the Channel has been closed.",131,"0"

"FONTCONFIG-23336","unable to display bitmap-only (SFNT) TrueType or OpenType","I brought this up previously in Fedora's font list [1]. After some further tests I realized that SFNT bitmap-only ttf is still not supported by the main-stream Linux font rendering pipeline (freetype2/fontconfig/pango etc I am not sure which one). 

About 3 years ago with hand-coded cache file this SFNT TTF font used to be OK. Then it stopped working because fontconfig stared to use a binary cache file and it does not recognize SFNT TTF [2]. Only recently I recognized that fc-cache worked ok with this font but still the font can not be rendered.

Here is a test. An SFNT TTF CJK font can be downloaded from here [3] (2.4M). It is produced by fontforge [4]. 

First make sure you do not have wqy-bitmap-fonts or xfonts-wqy installed. Then unzip the file and install it to your ~/.fonts/ and update fc cache. Now fc-list and fc-match are able to query the detailed info of the font (WenQuanYi Bitmap Song). It works up to this point. However if you select this font from a font dialog bitmap glyphs will never be displayed instead it will be displayed by the fall-back fonts (DejaVu etc).

Same thing when running pango-view:

pango-view --waterfall --font=WenQuanYi Bitmap Song  --text=文泉驿点阵宋体

Since PCF/BDF are becoming legacy formats and SFNT TTF seems to be the most promising alternative. It would be great to support them in the font rendering pipeline of modern desktop.

Particular SVG picture showing the regression and screenshots

Problem description: 

As of version 4.1.1 (possibly earlier) SVG picture Background - Gray.svg found in attached zip archive is not displayed correctly when inserted in LO Writer document.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the Front_page.odt document found in attached zip archive.

Current behavior:

In version 4.1.1 of LO Writer the picture is displayed in color instead of light gray. The light gray version of the picture was done by coloring colored version of the picture in light gray using Inkscape. As a result of that light gray color was defined explicitly in style= but the original color was left defined in class=. Here is an example from attached SVG:

<circle
   ...
   style=fill:#e8e8e8fill-opacity:1
   ....
   class=fil24
/>

where class fil24 is defined as:

.fil24 {fill:#2F6864}

In attached zip archive you will find screenshots of the document displayed in LO Writer version 4.0.5 and 4.1.1. It seems that class= is taking precedence over style= so picture is displayed colored instead of light gray.

The SVG picture is displayed correctly (light gray) in version 4.1.1 of LO Draw so only Writer is affected

Expected behavior:

Attached SVG picture should be displayed light gray.

The GPU is Radeon RX 560 (4GB memory).

The CPU is AMD Threadripper 1920x (12 cores/24 threads) so it may be one where the optimisations are applied. Are Threadripper CCX/core layout properly recognized by the patch for Ryzen?

Before the patch I noticed the speed of the game can be visibly negatively affected if other tasks are running on the CPU. So I always run the game with no other CPU heavy tasks running. The report is also with no other tasks. It may be the change of thread scheduling from the patch has now invoked the core/thread load scenario the game is sensitive to.

I too have a Fujitsu Scenic with integrated Intel graphics and I have a
similar problem with the release version of 7.10. It was a clean install of the
OS not an upgrade or dual boot.

The symptoms are From power up the Ubuntu splash screen and progress bar are
displayed ok. Once the progress bar reaches the end and the splash screen
closes there is a brief delay then the display corrupts with vertical green
white blue and black lines. The circular mouse cursor with the rotating dots
is also displayed but the dots and cursor freeze. The display then flashes once
to black then the vertical lines are displayed again in a different pattern.
The PC freezes at this point and I have to power off to restart it.

I can get round this by tapping the F8 key several times as soon as the splash
screen closes and the PC boots normally. I don't know if the F8 key does
anything specific or if any F key could be used.

I also think that if you reboot the PC it restarts as normal. It is only when
you power up from cold that this happens but I haven't confirmed this yet.

dmesg since boot with drm.debug=0x06

Hi

I noticed that the touchpad coasting has been acting really strange at random with the current release candidates of 4.14 with rc6 being the last I tested. Everything is fine with 4.13 or older releases.

After a bit of experimenting it seems that whenever my desktop environment shows an on screen display touchpad coasting happens in the wrong direction: if I'm scrolling up the window scrolls down. I can upload a video showing the problem if needed. I think the problem is caused by some desktop effect that is used for OSDs since I think I've observed the same behavior even when no OSD was displayed. In addition to that disabling desktop effects gets rid of the problem.

Interestingly I observed this behavior only with QT applications.

This has never happened with 4.13 so I did a bisection and found the change that's causing this behavior:

commit dc911f5bd8aacfcf8aabd5c26c88e04c837a938e
Author: Jim Bride 
Date:   Wed Aug 9 12:48:53 2017 -0700

    drm/i915/edp: Allow alternate fixed mode for eDP if available.

I confirm that reverting this change fixes the problem on v4.14-rc6. This could really be a bug in some userspace component that it's being triggered by that change but it has never happened until now so I'm reporting this here.

I built xf86-video-intel from master (4798e18b2b2c8b0a05dc967e6140fd9962bc1a73) but the problem persists.

I'm using Debian sid and xserver 1.19.5 on a Dell XPS 13 9333 (i7-4500U with HD Graphics 4400).

commit 9d96d3803ab5dc896d4844ac785db57bb1717f91
Author: Timothy Arceri 
Date:   Mon Oct 31 23:54:03 2016 +1100

    glsl: create gl_program at the start of linking rather than the end
    
    This will allow us to directly store metadata we want to retain in
    gl_program this metadata is currently stored in gl_linked_shader and
    will be lost if relinking fails even though the program will remain
    in use and is still valid according to the spec.
    
    If a program object that is active for any shader stage is re-linked
    unsuccessfully the link status will be set to FALSE but any existing
    executables and associated state will remain part of the current
    rendering state until a subsequent call to UseProgram
    UseProgramStages or BindProgramPipeline removes them from use.
    
    This change will also help avoid the double handing that happens in
    _mesa_copy_linked_program_data().

---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-07-18 09:18:00 +0000 ----

Affects 1.1.99.5.

When setting up a target config for WebDAV which stores the password in the keyring then accessing items (for example --print-items) fails with an authentication error because the password is not retrieved from the keyring before running the operation.

One of the following workarounds avoids the issue:
* configure with syncevolution --daemon=no
* add password= to the command line when running the operation



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-09 10:44:41 +0000 ----

Merged for 1.2:

commit 7411f7e8e3df028a382ec9ff04d6a12586b5ffaf
Author: Salvatore Iovene 
Date:   Wed Aug 3 12:08:02 2011 +0300

    Fixes BMC#21311 - item operations: authentication problem for WebDAV when using keyring
    
    Use checkPassword() before trying to --print-items. This will either
    prompt for the password at command line or ask it from the keyring
    if --keyring is specified (or if using the dbus server).



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-09-14 13:14:37 +0000 ----

One additional fix was needed:

commit 0b8a15362f0dd63f9b694c5af636dd36a6688941
Author: Patrick Ohly 
Date:   Wed Sep 14 13:21:59 2011 +0200

    command line: also check password for --import/export/delete-items and the source (BMC #21311 #22937)
    
    The previous commit 7411f7e had the password check in the code branch
    for --print-items. --import/export/delete-items still had the same
    problem. Moved the code.
    
    Source passwords must also be checked in case that backendPassword
    is set. Added.

Hello

The file not being saved is simple_file_save_ko.ods and theprinted error are:

The bug is when I double-clik on this network file and change the content the firs_error.jpg appears two times and the second_error.jpg appears one time.

I think the problem come from this commit:

"XORG-8586","[i810] X with i810 driver dies when switching from textmode virtual console back to an active X session","This problem appears to be similar to #5795 but that bug has been
closed.  I have been asked to start a new bug report so here it is. 

Using Alt-F8 to switch from a virtual terminal back to an active X
session causes X to terminate.

My video chip is an 810e.  (Note the e.)

Machine:       Compaq 7587 (Pentium III 550 MHz 320 MB RAM)
Video chip:    i810e
Linux kernel:  Debian 2.4.27-3
x.org ver:     7.1.1
Resolution 1680x1050 16 bpp.
Video RAM allocated: 24000 kiB

(1) Started with startx -- -logverbose 9  date
    from virtual terminal 2.
(2) Graphics screen comes up fine everything works.
(3) Did an Alt+Ctrl+1 to switch to virtual terminal 1.
(4) X is still active (according to ps)
    X programs are still running fine (as evidenced by my network activity)
(5) Only when I try to switch back to X (with an Alt-F8) does something
    funny happen:

      (a) X instantly dies (I will attach a -logverbose 9 report).
          Because of the date command above I can confirm that the
          death is prompt.

      (b) The Alt-F8 switches me to virtual terminal 8 all right but
          it remains in text mode and all I see is a blank screen.

      (c) When I switch back to virtual terminal 2 I see the following
          output from X:

              Fatal server error:
              EnterVT failed for screen 0

Unlike some reports for bug 5795 a subsequent startx command has no
problem starting X again.

The newer driver from fairlite appears to have the same odd behavior.

Since my video chip is an 810e I could run at 1680x1050 without any
855resolution/915resolution tricks.

add a systemd service

udisks should install a systemd service file and add a SystemdService= line to
its dbus-activated service.

By doing that it will be started by systemd instead of dbus.
This has the advantage that it will be treated like any other system daemon and
put in its own cgroup by systemd. Also its state can be checked and it can
easily be restarted or stopped if it might misbehave.

On systems without systemd dbus will start the daemon itself just like it
does now.

Attached is a patch that implements this behaviour.
Like most other packages that support systemd it adds a
--with-systemdsystemunitdir switch to configure.
Installation of the systemd service file can also be disabled using this
configure switch.

Please note that I could not test this patch yet as I don't have a new enough glib availiable to compile the current master branch.

    if (catDict.isDict()) {
      Object markInfoDict = catDict.dictLookup(MarkInfo)
      if (markInfoDict.isDict()) {

"XORG-13459","radeonhd driver with non-ATI PCI vendor ID","On my Samsung R24plusF000 laptop ATI Mobility Radeon X2300 has non-ATI PCI vendor ID. As a result X does not start with radeonhd driver. I see No device found in Xorg.log.

Video card presented in the system as:
Vendor ID: 0x0001
Device ID: 0x7188
Subsystem vendor ID: 0x144D
Subsystem device ID: 0xC515

Patch below resolves this problem for me but it is ugly for PCI_VENDOR_ID_ATI replacement.

After recompiling with this patch applyed my display starts in 1280x800 resolution which is native for my panel.

"FONTCONFIG-236","Add 75dpi/100dpi XFree fonts to fonts.conf","I recently installed KDE to try it out. When starting KDE applications I saw a
very ugly font used in the user interface which I thought was weird. I went to
the the KDE control center and noticed that the default font was set to
Helvetica but it surely wasn't helvetica being shown.

I found out that fontconfig wasn't even aware of the helvetica font and
apparently just picked the first font in alphabetically order instead in this
case Agate.

So I wondered why couldn't fontconfig find my Helvetica fonts? They are located
in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi (and 75dpi). Opening up
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf I noticed that only these directories are looked in per
default:

        /usr/share/fonts
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 /usr/local/share/fonts
        ~/.fonts

So I added /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi and suddenly my KDE looked excellent!

Should this font path not be added to fonts.conf per default?

an example of a real world problem.",281,"1"

The bug is reproducible with a fairly recent build.

To reproduce just install the extensions and you got this behavior even though it seems they don't have update enabled.

1) Install Libo I installed it from deb packages as standard it ended up in /opt/libreoffice3 installed extension packages as well.

2) installed some of my extension as well.

3) trying an update just to test.

4) LibO chrashed.

5) removed all the extensions but mine (they have update enabled as well): no crashes.

6) did a fake update of one of my extensions trying to update: no problem there no crashed and extension updated.

Commecting with gdb and after a crash I got this bt:

"DRI-94011","rendering corruption (horizontal banding) when not on battery power","Running on Debian unstable with the upgrade to xserver-xorg 2:1.18.0-3 and
xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.99.917+git20160127-1+b1 I'm experiencing
the weirdest rendering corruption which mostly manifests through a
horizontal banding of the display. Snapshots of the correct and glitched
display can be found at these imgur links:

http://i.imgur.com/V9V8s8h.png
http://i.imgur.com/NhNq9OF.png

The issue doesn't normally manifest in my setup and with the applications
I use with the only exception of Opera 12 which manifests it quite
consistently. Previous versions of the graphics stack on Debian (particularly
xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.99.917-2 from testing on pre-1.18
Xorg) work fine.

Most interesting the glitch only manifests when running on AC. If the
laptop is on battery there are no issues.

between commit Use render node for DRI3 if available and glamor: Return NullPixmap on failure to create shareable pixmap something broke mpv's OGL output. I can bisect that if needed.

When I run -vo vdpau it works fine but -vo opengl or -vo opengl-hq gives me no video in the window and error lines such as:

[vo/opengl-hq] after creating framebuffer texture: OpenGL error INVALID_OPERATION.
[vo/opengl-hq] after rendering: OpenGL error INVALID_OPERATION.

Rolling back to commit Set RADEON_GEM_NO_CPU_ACCESS flag for BOs which don't need CPU access fixes it.

I see nothing in dmesg related.
Other OGL programs seem to still run fine (I tried glxgears and dolphin-emu quickly) so I am not sure.

I am on Linux 4.5 mesa git Xorg 1.18.2 using a 280X.
I tried using mpv from latest git in case but it didn't change anything from 0.16.

"LIBREOFFICE-65994","Dutch spell checking does not work other languages work doubtfull","Since version 4.0.4 the Dutch spelling correction no longer works.
This applies to Windows XP/7 and Linux (openSUSE and Ubuntu).
It applies to upgraded installations (from 3.6 4.0.2 and 4.0.3) and to clean installations.

behaviour:
-open a new document
-type a Dutch word (fiets)
-it is marked with a red wavy line below it
-on pressing the right mouse key with the cursor on the word no suggestions for correct spelling appear
-when the word has been selected and the menu option extra-language-selection is chosen Frisian (once Catalan!) was shown apart from Dutch and no other languages (not even English). Frisian (or Catalan) was not 'installed' as used language but chosing it (Catalan too!) makes the red wavy line disappear. Adding a new language sometimes works (e.g. English GB) correctly but on other occasions it does not (e.g. Catalan Chuvash).

I checked on master (4.2.0.0.alpha+) and there the behaviuour is not identical but also incorrect. two words: fiets (Dutch) and Farad (incorrect German) are both shown as correct in Dutch German Catalan Chuvash and are both shown as incorrect in English-US.",31,"0"

    Fill alpha on xrgb images.
    
    Do not try to fixup the alpha in the ff/shaders as this has the
    side-effect of overriding the alpha value of the border color causing
    images to be padded with black rather than transparent. This can
    generate large and obnoxious visual artefacts.

Updated Bulgarian layouts

Please find attached a patch for an updated version of the Bulgarian keyboard file.

Some information about the keyboard layouts in Bulgaria (maybe unnecessary):

1. Currently there is only one standardized Bulgarian keyboard layout - BDS 5237-78 (BDS means Bulgarian State Standard).

2. The so called phonetic layout became popular after 1980 when the mass-production of the Bulgarian clones of Apple ][ started.  These computers used phonetic Cyrillic keyboard layout (unchangeable) and they were produced in great quantities (up to 1994).

3. When the Bulgarian clones of IBM PC became popular (about 1989) they supported both the standard BDS layout and the slightly modified phonetic layout.  People who learned to use computers on the Apple ][ clones continued to use the phonetic layout.  Most programmers used the phonetic layout and many of the young people.  As a result the phonetic layout became much more popular than the standardized BDS.

4. Some years ago in a duscussion of a Bulgarian LUG it was noticed that 99% of the Bulgarian Linux users (at that time) used the phonetic layout.  Nevertheless it was decided that in order to make the free software more user-friendly to new users keyboard configuration programs should propose by default the BDS layout and the phonetic layout as an option.

5. MS Windows before Vista supported only BDS.  Bulgarians traditionally used add-on programs in order to add support for the phonetic layout.

6. Around 2005 a group in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences decided to develop a new version of the Bulgarian keyboard standard that includes the phonetic layout.  This new phonetic layout was included in Windows Vista.

7. Unfortunately their version of the phonetic layout changed the traditional positions of 6 letters.  The Bulgarian law requres public discussion of new State standards.  The opposition against the new phonetic layout was so prominent that the new standard was not accepted. Officialy it is in a state of re-examination but I have some doubts that a new standard will be accepted even in a modified form.

8. The group behind the new phonetic layout asked me to give them a XKB version of the new phonetic layout.  I didn't propose this new layout for inclusion in xkeyboard-config because didn't want to include in the Bulgarian keyboard file a layout that nobody uses.

9. But I was wrong. :) Windows Vista supported the new phonetic layout and this was enought for it to form some user-base.  Some users submitted a bug report in Ubuntu requesting support of the new phonetic layout and the people in Ubuntu were kind enough to transfer the request to you - https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20301 As a result my file was included in xkeyboard-config without me knowing this.

The following summarizes the differences between the layouts in this bug report and the version that is currently in xkeyboard-config.

1. The new layouts define four keysyms per key.  The symbols in levels 3 and 4 were discussed in a Bulgarian LUG in 2007.

2. There is a new Latin layout - the same as the standard QWERTY layout but with additional symbols in levels 3 and 4. The layout is hidden in order not to confuse the users.

3. The name of the new phonetic layout is changed from Bulgaria - Standard Phonetic to Bulgaria - New phonetic.  Reason: the name Standard is confusing. The new layout is not more standard than the old one and for most people Standard=Traditional.

4. The BDS layout is changed to follow the new proposed State standard.  These changes are good and minor and I think nobody needs the old BDS layout.

5. Similarly to this I updated the non-letter symbols in the traditional phonetic layout to be the same as the symbols in the new phonetic layout.  These changes affect only symbols that are not used while the keyboard is in Cyrillic mode so I think nobody will need the old variant of the traditional phonetic layout.  A developer of Microsoft told me that he will try to add in Windows 8 and maybe even in Windows 7 the traditional phonetic layout with the same changes as in this patch.

Dmesg from system start until and including the second time a kernel backtrace appears

I was referred by my distributions bug tracking to report an error related to the Nouveau drivers here.

I use the Tumbleweed distribution by Opensuse. This is a kind of rolling release with package upgrades circa once a week. On 2015-11-08 I pulled that distributions latest snapshot which installed among not many other packages Linux kernel version 4.3.0 which was an upgrade from 4.2.4.

Since then I experience grave issues when using the KDE desktop. Beginning on that Sunday (i.e. 2015-11-08) after some time of using the desktop I noticed that KDEs text editor (Kwrite) would not start anymore when launched from the file manager. Initially I thought this was an communcation problem inside KDE because I could restart the file manager and managed to open one text file. But then attempting to launch a second instance of Kwrite via the file mananger failed again. I tried repeatedly and found that after very few attempts Kwrite could not be launched anymore. At that time I could still interact with other running programs. But after some time the whole desktop locked up. Not even switchting to a text console via Ctrl + F1 worked. The system had to be rebooted.

I can now reproduce a whole desktop lockup by this simple procedure:

- Power on
- Login in KDM
- Pressing Alt + F2 then typing konsole in the mini command line
- Entering dmesg in Konsole window.
- Opening a second Konsole tab.
- In that new tab typing kwrite. Kwrite is not launched successfully by that attempt.


To gather information I installed kernel version 4.2.4 from the distributions package in parallel to 4.3.0.

When I boot 4.2.4 I can not reproduce the desktop lockups.

I have attached the complete dmesg output which stems from the procedure to reproduce above. As you can see there are some suspicious kernel backtraces related to Nouveau. One of these backtraces is associated in time closely to attempting to launch Kwrite i.e. after I type dmesg for the first time I only see one backtrace. Then after entering kwrite I can request dmesg again and spot the second kernel backtrace.

With slightly older kernel versions I also get these kernel backtraces in the system log (journalctl) but I do NOT experience whole desktop lockups. With even older kernel versions I do not get these types of kernel backtraces. 
These are the lines from when journactl indicates a similar backtrace for the first time: (The installed kernel must have been 4.2.3 as far as I can determine through inspecting the package install history logfile.)

For your information I have attached files showing the package install history (only the most recent weeks) output of hwinfo --gfx and a bit of information about installed packages (I hope you can make something out of the RPM output if not I am glad to supply any missing information). Of course I attached the dmesg output as well as written above.

For reference I opened this report in Opensuses bug tracking: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=954473

For further information for some time now (ca. since mid 2015) I also get similar Nouveau failure message to those that are attached here: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92504
But these do not usually provoke hard desktop lockups and are only seen when I also use Firefox which I do sparingly. So that is likely a separate problem which has a weak relation to my recent troubles.",86,"0"

    xfree86: vgaarb: fix device decoding interface to send resources type properly

    Right now when there is more than one vide card on the machine we're
    adopting a pessimistic approach and setting all cards to decode VGA legacy
    address.

    Some cards may want to skip the arbitration and the only way to do so is
    through pci_device_vgaarb_decodes. Therefore send the desired kind of
    resource instead force the worst case.

    Note that xf86VGAarbiterDeviceDecodes is not being used so far by any
    open-source driver. Even so API break.

"MESA-14270","Memory leak in bufmgr_fake.c","Hi
As of release 7.0.1 there is a memory leak in bufmgr_fake.c. 

If bmDeleteBuffers is called on a buffer that has backing_store allocated the backing_store is never freed. On our application this resulted in a rather large memory leak (~300MB in an hour).

The fix is to add the following at line 704 of bufmgr_fake.c

// tpd - 1/24/08 - Free backing store if allocated!
if (buf && buf->backing_store)
   free_backing_store(intel buf)

This fixes the leak.

it would be nice if cairo didn't export private symbols like _cairo_atomic_mutex _cairo_font_face_mutex etc.

Attached patch makes cairo export whatever is in cairo.def (for some reason I don't have that file) on win32 as it was before but uses a symbol export regexp on other systems that makes it export only ^cairo.* symbols.

Add timestamp to the Xorg logs

Hi

Since some weks (after a Debian Sid upgrade) Xorg lost my keyboard after 2 to 10 days. But my problem is not the keyboard but that Xorg doesn't log timestamp in Xorg.0.log.

Ubuntu has its own patch 160_log_timestamping.patch but it's disabled because the patch also has a serious stack corruption bug...
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/285787

160_log_timestamping.patch only changes LogVMessageVerb() so messages written by ErrorF() and VErrorF() don't have the timestamp. And the timestamp is repeated multiple times per line of the log message doesn't contain any newline character.

I wrote my own patch:
 - patch LogVWrite() to write the timestamp before any kind of message
 - detect the new line character to avoid multiple timestamps per line
 - use time()+localtime()+strftime(%F %T ) to get timestamp like 2010-01-23 03:15:10 whereas Ubuntu's patch writes the number of seconds (and microseconds) since Xorg started (eg. [ 0.019917] )
 - add a static buffer of 21 bytes in LogVWrite() (allocated in the stack at runtime)

The timestamp is only read and formatted once per log line (and not once call to LogVWrite()). I don't know the overhead but it should be quite small.

There is a reentrant function localtime_r() but it is not available everywhere and I don't feel confortable with the autotools :-)",240,"1"

On X startup the intel driver detects two outputs: LVDS at 1280x800 and TV at 1027x768.  It exports this information to applications as two Xinerama screens (I hope I got my terminology right): screen 0 is +0+0-1024x768 screen 1 is +0+0-1280x800.  As a result GDM and GNOME panels are limited to the 1024x768 area of the desktop.  xrandr --output TV --off fixes this.

I would be happy with any of the following fixes:

  * make the intel driver correctly detect that I do not have a TV connected to my nonexistent TV out connection.

  * make the intel driver export the TV output as Xinerama screen 0 rather than 1 so that GDM and gnome panels would use the full size of the laptop panel.

By the way if I try to disable the TV output in Xorg.conf with

Given a shader that includes a uniform such as:

uniform float u_array[4]

void main()
{
... something that uses u_array[0..3]
}

glGetUniformfv with the location of u_array or u_array[0] (they're identical locations as per the spec) does something very strange that ends up scribbling the stack.  For that uniform the gl_program_parameter struct looks like:

Name: u_array
Type: PROGRAM_UNIFORM
DataType: 0x1406
Size: 0x10
Used: 0x01
Initialized: 0x01

The Size of 0x10 seems to have somehow ended up as the size in bytes of the uniform storage.  This causes a problem in get_uniform_rows_cols where it does:

if (p->Size <= 4) {
  *rows = 1
  *cols = p->Size
} else {
  *rows = p->Size / 4 + 1
  if (p->Size % 4 == 0)

  else

Ksnapshot is a tool for taking screenshots. When used in the described environment Ksnapshot captures itself instead of the rest of the desktop. This doesn't happens when DRI3 is turned of or window-manager (kwin) 3d acceleration is turned of.

It was caused by Xorg running Plasma Shell.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Using Libreoffice 4.2.1 Open the attached file - sales view file - Test 
2. Do not Update the Links
3. Still you will see #REF! error in the cells which are having 'Text' in reference links but the cells fields having numbers shows up perfectly (in spite of having similar reference links)

If the same file is opened (without updating links) using gnumeric or Libreoffice 4.1.5  This error is not seen.

"LIBREOFFICE-78477","segfault on startup but only with some fonts installed","Created attachment 98738
TrueType font file

Greetings
    I'm using LibreOffice 4.1.4.2 from the backports repository of Debian Linux 7 with some thousand files in my ~/.font directory which keeps growing up as I'm collecting fonts since a long time ago. It was possible to isolate via strace a segmentation fault in libvcllo.so which prevented LibreOffice from starting at all. Removing from ~/.fonts just a couple of fonts (one is attached here they seem to belong to the same family) allowed LibreOffice to start flawlessly again. Opening the fonts with gnome-font-viewer allowed to see they're made only of numeric digits and some symbol which is not expected to cause a segmentation fault anyway. It must be something in the file structure.

    I'm unsure about the weakness creating this problem apparently due to some poor handling of bad/unexpected data. If it's located in lower level components used by libvcllo.so then I shall move the problem to the Debian maintaners for sure.

    If however it is due to LibreOffice itself solving this problem might even close unconfirmed/unreproduceable situations sharing the same cause which seems an opportunity too important to ignore. Is anyone capable/willing to test this with other versions of LibreOffice and/or Linux? The test isn't supposed to corrupt your system if the behavior is the same I experienced then it will be sufficient to remove the offending font to get LibreOffice running again. Thanks.

## Summary
pdfunite util in poppler-0.55.0 will crash when parsing a crafted pdf file because the program fall into a recursive and interactive call of two functions and eventually exhaust the stack space.


## Reproduce

spreadsheet crashing during FILEOPEN adapt row height

Problem description: 
A particular .ods spreadsheet file causes LibO 3.6.1.2 to crash midway through FILEOPEN Adapt how height phase. Local installations and portable versions of 3.6.1.2 exhibit the same behaviour. However the file opens normally in 3.5.5.3 and 3.5.6.2.

See also this thread http://en.libreofficeforum.org/node/4326

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open new LibO 3.6.1.2 spreadsheet document
2. File > Open > select attached sample file > double click

Current behavior:
LibO crashes partway through the Adapt row height phase of loading the file with the message LibreOffice 3.6 has stopped working. Memory usage is not excessive so this bug is distinct from #44420.

Expected behavior:
Normal loading of the file as occurs in LibO 3.5.5.3 (Windows portable) and 3.5.6.2 (Linux).

Horizontal ruler

Hello

This was an issue which I have never paid much attention before but today realised that it was all wrong. 

Numbering on the horizontal ruler is wrong and numbers are not aligned with the gaps-intervals-spaces. 

Let's see:

Horizontal ruler has 18 intervals in total. This is also indicated on the ruler. But when we count the numbering and the intervals we only get 16 because numbers are not aligned with the ruler. 

Well we can solve it like this I guess numbering should be aligned and it should end at 16 instead 18.

accessible-event listener

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a Writer document with spelling errors
2. Load the attached accessible-event listener in a terminal
3. Press F7 to start spell checking
4. Arrow around in the text widget displaying the error (Not in Dictionary)
5. Insert and delete text in the widget displaying the error

Expected results:
1. After step 3 the tree printed out would include an accessible object implementing AtkText which displays the error.
2. When steps 4 and 5 are performed accessible events would appear in the terminal

Actual results: Neither of the above happen. In particular:

[snip]
                -> [label | Not in dictionary]
                -> [scroll pane | Not in dictionary]
                    -> [panel | ]
                    -> [scroll bar | Vertical scroll bar]
                -> [push button | Ignore Once]
[snip]

And there are no accessible text events for that widget.

Note: The latter (no accessible text events) likely follows from the former (no accessible object). So were it me I'd start debugging the first issue and see if the second magically goes away when it is fixed. :)",20,"0"

"DBUS-98157","format string vulnerability processing ActivationFailure messages","While trying to fix all the compiler warnings (Bug #97357) I tried enabling -Wsuggest-attribute=format and found this:

---

dbus-daemon listens for ActivationFailure signals coming from systemd. When running with --systemd-activation these signals are used to report that systemd could not activate a D-Bus service for us when not using --systemd-activation they are still processed.

dbus-daemon passes the human-readable message contained in these signals to dbus_set_error() where a format string is expected. In principle this could lead to arbitrary memory overwrite via a format string attack in the message received from systemd resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    
I believe this is not an exploitable security vulnerability on the system bus in practice: it can only be exploited by the owner of the org.freedesktop.systemd1 bus name which is restricted to uid 0 so if systemd is attacker-controlled then the system is already doomed. Similarly if a systemd system unit mentioned in the activation failure message has an attacker-controlled name then the attacker likely already has sufficient access to execute arbitrary code as root in any case.
    
However prior to dbus 1.8.16 and 1.9.10 due to a missing check for systemd's identity unprivileged processes could forge activation failure messages which would have gone through this code path. We thought at the time that this was a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2015-0245) this bug means that it was in fact potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

From: Joerg Sonnenberger 
To: xorg_security@x.org
Subject: Off-by-one in libXfont-1.3.1

Hi
the update from libXfont-1.3.0 to 1.3.1 changed catalogue.c to
NUL-terminate the buffer passed to readlink. This is not correct if
readlink writes exactly sizeof dest bytes as it writes exactly one byte
after the limit. The old code was not vulnerable as it copied to a newly
allocated buffer of the right size.

This code should be somewhat reorganised to use asprintf/snprintf and
making it a lot more readable but that is a visual matter independent
of the actual issue.",0,"0"

Apple MacBook Pro 55 (Nov 2009) - United-Kingdom Keayboard Layout Photo

This bug is created as requested from existing bug (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28353).

By this message I would like to report the bug I encounter with keyboard
detection on Laptop MacBook Pro 55 (purchased in Nov 2009) in the UK installed
with Ubuntu 9.10 (and fully updated) on amd64 architecture.

----------------------------------------------------
Summary 

The UK keyboard layout of this laptop is quite special and none of the
existing option in the gnome setting panel of the keyboard allow full
recognition of this layout.

----------------------------------------------------
Full description

Following installation of Ubuntu it appears that by default the specific UK
keyboard of Apple MacBook pro laptop version 55 of Nov 2009 is not properly
recognised. It also appears to me after comparing with other keyboard that
Apple slightly changed the layout for that specific version of laptop (After
completing this message I will attach the keyboard layout image for you to
see remind me if I forgot to attach file :)

Please note also that I have also to write in French with this keyboard so in
order to match my need and the layout here is how I configured the layout in
gnome:

System > Preference > Keyboard
then Tab Layout
Keyboard Model: MacBook/MacBookPro (Intl)
Selected Layout: United Kingdom International (with dead keys)
Previously set to United Kindom Macintoch (which remain in the list of layout
but unselected)

I managed so far to make some of french letter with following key combinaison :
ALT Right + : + e = é
ALT Right + ' + e = ê (or SHIFT + 6 + e)
ALT Right + \| + e = è (or `¬ + e)
but I can't manage to type this letter
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 (maybe due to my ignorance of the proper
key combination can't find it)

Those combinaison while not totally working are much more complicated that the
usual once met on US International Keyboard :
' + e = é
` + e = è
' + c = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87

As I work as well under Debian (within a virtual machine on this Laptop hosted
by Ubuntu) I did managed at some point of time under this operating system to
solve some of my issue by twinking manually the defaut keyboard layout config
file as follow (information below may not be totally accurate as I don't recall
exaclty the process) :

File manually modified (corresponding to english keyboard layout) :
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb 

I edited file and modified the intl part as follow to match UK keyboard layout
:
$ gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb

$ setxkbmap

I am sure they might be a better and more professional and finish way to do it
but as I am not very familiar with the keybaord conf architecture it is very
difficult for me event to understand clearly how I manage to do this :)

Ideally I would prefer to see an option in the keyboard gnome setting panel
like :

Keyboard model: MacBook Pro 55
Select Layout: UK International (which works as US International keyboard)

This way I would be sure it works :)

Patch to prevent segfault in teardown when using RPi backend

When running with the RPi backend Weston sefaults during shutdown. This is due to the fact that `compositor->backend` is never initialised and there is no NULL check prior to calling `destroy()`.

I'm attaching a small patch that fixes the issue by making `rpi_backend_create()` intialise `compositor->backend` - just like the X11 backend does. Please consider this patch for inclusion on master.",4,"0"

 Fglrx and swrast behave fine.

 Some other user at phoronix compared 7790 Bonaire (which also show a bug) with Intel HD 2500 and i can say intel works fine so intel does not show this bug.

Correct selection

When selecting faces in K-3D selections are fine in Mesa 7.0.1 but seem to go through the object in 7.0.3 (as obtained from ubuntu 8.04). The problem still appeared in the GIT version obtained a few days ago. The 7.0.1 shows correct behavior resulting in the front face being selected (red) when it is clicked. Doing the same operation in 7.0.3 (second screenshot) results in the bottom face being selected even though the front face was clicked. At the moment of the selection click the bottom face was behind the front face. It appears as though when in GL_SELECT mode Mesa gets the depth order wrong.

THe bug appears both in the VBO and non-VBO code for drawing faces. Selection in K-3D happens in GL_SELECT mode.

my Xorg configuration

I just had a first shot at the nouveau Xorg driver I'm a regular
nv user. It compiled and installed without a itch in a short time
congrats (great instructions on
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau) ran fine... but
with a funny vertical fencing effect: one vertical line out of two was
black. After a few minutes the effect would spontaneously ﻿switch (no
input from me no app activity) to white vertical lines with the same
stripping setup (which gives a dimming or enlightening effect +
rather crunchy text).

  When reverting to the nv driver and simply restarting X the fencing
effect persisted. So nv seems to rely on some BIOS stuff that
nouveau fiddles with. I (warm-)rebooted the whole system with the
nouveau driver on in order for it to benefit from the BIOS same
problem. Same procedure while adding the Option FlatPanel True same
problem. Then (warm-)reboot with the nv driver on everything working
fine again.

"WOCKY-31031","Add (optional) support for Nokia's heartbeat service","Maemo 5's Loudmouth was patched to add support for Nokia's IP heartbeat service which helps to reduce radio wake-ups. Processes which need to make periodic network requests but which do not care about the *exact* period ask a daemon to wake them up at some point during a certain time interval in the future the daemon chooses to wake up processes slightly early if it means that they can be woken up at the same time as other processes.

This branch adds similar code to Wocky. It's much better than the code that was in Loudmouth: it supports varying the interval on the fly and supports falling back to internal timeouts if the heartbeat service breaks somehow.

I've tested this branch in Gabble both with and without iphb support and empirically tested the fallback when the heartbeat service dies. There is no automated test for the iphb code: while the wire protocol is pretty simple I didn't really fancy implementing a dummy service for the test suite particularly since iphb hard-codes the path to the unix socket to be ahem /dev/shm/iphb.

Functionally this does change the ping behaviour of Wocky somewhat. See http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=user/wjt/wocky.gita=commitdiffh=beeb0676e3708c91dca867c1620ae72b204c1dba for details of the change. I don't think it's too big a deal.",20,"0"

    drm/i915: Fix up the vma aliasing ppgtt binding

    Currently we have the problem that the decision whether ptes need to
    be (re)written is splattered all over the codebase. Move all that into
    i915_vma_bind. This needs a few changes:
    - Just reuse the PIN_* flags for i915_vma_bind and do the conversion
      to vma->bound in there to avoid duplicating the conversion code all
      over.
    - We need to make binding for EXECBUF (i.e. pick aliasing ppgtt if
      around) explicit add PIN_USER for that.
    - Two callers want to update ptes give them a PIN_UPDATE for that.

    Of course we still want to avoid double-binding but that should be
    taken care of:
    - A ppgtt vma will only ever see PIN_USER so no issue with
      double-binding.
    - A ggtt vma with aliasing ppgtt needs both types of binding and we
      track that properly now.
    - A ggtt vma without aliasing ppgtt could be bound twice. In the
      lower-level ->bind_vma functions hence unconditionally set
      GLOBAL_BIND when writing the ggtt ptes.

    There's still a bit room for cleanup but that's for follow-up
    patches.

    v2: Fixup fumbles.

    v3: s/PIN_EXECBUF/PIN_USER/ for clearer meaning suggested by Chris.

1) automagically builds man-pages if xmlto is found on system
We in gentoo would more preffer to have possibility to configure this like lets say configure --enable-doc

see more on http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml

2) alerting CFLAGS with weird options by default
you should just add some --enable-debug or something to pass -g -Wall -Werror options and not enforce them on all users since most of them will just strip the outputting binaries anyway.

Running xorg on a Lenovo X1 carbon gen4 (skylake) with any recent Linux kernel (currently 4.8.8-1-ARCH) the backlight information vanishes after some time:

Calling xbacklight gives an empty result:

[10:56] feder:~% xbacklight 
[10:56] feder:~% xbacklight -set 100
[10:56] feder:~% echo $?
0

However when restarting xorg it works for some time (some hours).

I first assumed it might be related to suspend however yesterday it also happened without a suspend in between.

were used between r1 and later releases.  So far I've compiled r2 r3 r4 and
xorg-x11-6.8.99.15-r1.  All produce the same result.  

I'm not sure how much spec I need to give but my video card (from lspci):

This does not seem to affect GLUT applications (thus the difficulty I'm having in producing a test case) but it does affect Clutter ( http://clutter-project.org/ ) projects.

    drm/i915: Only unpin the default ctx object if it exists

    Since commit 691e6415c891b8b2b082a120b896b443531c4d45
    Author: Chris Wilson 
    Date:   Wed Apr 9 09:07:36 2014 +0100

        drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

    we have contexts everywhere and so we must be careful to distinguish
    fake contexts which do not have an associated bo and real ones which
    do. In particular we now need to be careful not to dereference NULL
    pointers.

    This is one such example as the commit highlighted above failed to move
    the unpinning of the default ctx object into the real-context-only
    branch.

    drm/i915: Increase WM memory latency values on SNB

    On SNB the BIOS provided WM memory latency values seem insufficient to
    handle high resolution displays.

    In this particular case the display mode was a 2560x1440@60Hz which
    makes the pixel clock 241.5 MHz. It was empirically found that a memory
    latency value if 1.2 usec is enough to avoid underruns whereas the BIOS
    provided value of 0.7 usec was clearly too low. Incidentally 1.2 usec
    is what the typical BIOS provided values are on IVB systems.

    Increase the WM memory latency values to at least 1.2 usec on SNB.
    Hopefully this won't have a significant effect on power consumption.

    v2: Increase the latency values regardless of the pixel clock

I’m running upower on a 64bit glibc Gentoo hardened system. Recently the daemon manager OpenRC introduced support for cgroupv2. Using that leads
to segfaults.

Quote from OpenRC’s config file (/etc/rc.conf):
# This sets the mode used to mount cgroups.
# hybrid mounts cgroups version 2 on /sys/fs/cgroup/unified and
# cgroups version 1 on /sys/fs/cgroup.

dmesg xorg.conf Xorg.0.log/old

I got a crash with 2.2.0.90 when my laptop was under high memory
pressure and load. I've attached the two Xorg.log files from /var/log as
they both had the same timestamp. I think it is Xorg.log rather than
Xorg.log.old though. I didn't have any GL apps running at the time just
xchat gnome-terminal liferea galeon and evolution. I was compiling a
big C++ app (synfig) with -j2 at the time which caused the memory
pressure.

I occasionally get crashes the result is usually that the screen is messed up (purple mess at the top) but the kernel is fine so pressing the power button results in a graceful shutdown. I'm using a Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop.

Local exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in the 'CIDAFM()'
function in the X.Org and XFree86 X server could allow an attacker to
+execute arbitrary code with privileges of the X server typically root.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the 'CIDADM()' function of the code
responsible for handling AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) files. The number of character
metrics is obtained from the StartCharMetrics line of an AFM file and that
value is then multiplied by the size of a single character metric record in
order to calculate the space required to store the metrics. If the result of the
multiplication is larger than the largest value that can be held in an integer
the amount actually allocated will be much smaller. Following this the function
attempts to read as many metric records as were specified on the line into that
memory. As the contents of the file can be specified by a local user and as the
function will stop reading if an error is detected in the input a controlled
heap overflow may occur which may allow the execution of arbitrary code.",19,"0"

This seems a bit drastic it gave the impression that applications crashes while in actual fact this is a set up problem for dbus.

google dbus machine-id seems that there have been lots of bugs/problem assocaited with this. 

Can dbus lib uses a less severe form of error handling? like uses
_dbus_warn() which leads eventually to _dbus_abort if it fatal_warning is set.

But such an ordering is essential for firewall services that need to avoid leaks. I propose the following:

1. Ship an empty network-pre.target.

2. Add to systemd-networkd.service and network.target:

[Unit]
Requires=network-pre.target
After=network-pre.target

3. Document #2 as a convention for other network interface configuration services to follow.

With this in place a firewall service can finally do:

Myanmar3 Keyboard Layout

The basic layout for Burmese included x11 is not flexible (easy to type) and not widely used for typing Burmese. Actually I can honestly say that nobody ever uses that layout.

Until now we are using a custom debian package which overwrites that basic layout (symbols/mm). But since ubuntu (dpkg?) disables overwriting files of other packages (though it can still be enabled using --force-overwrite) it is getting more troublesome to install for non-geek users to install. 

I would like to request to change it to more widely used Myanmar3 layout. It is one of the most popular keyboard layouts for Burmese. It is also the official layout for Myanmar3 Unicode font produced Myanmar NLP. (http://www.myanmarnlp.net.mm/).",2,"0"

"XORG-2075","undefined symbols in various libs/apps in Linux due to incorrect SharedLibFooReqs or other factors","Various parts of the full monolithic 'xc' tree do not link properly to all
of their shared library dependancies.  In many cases these bugs go unnoticed
because they often do not cause any really visible runtime problems on Linux
and I assume on other OS's as well.  In some cases however they do cause
problems and they end up getting fixed eventually.

The bigger problem however as I see it anyway is that there are currently
no automated tests ran to detect undefined symbols at _build_ time and fail
the build or at least warn but I would prefer it to hard fail so things
get fixed instead of ignored.

If the build process was slightly enhanced to detect undefined symbols on
whatever OS/arch/toolchain combinations that have options for detecting this
such as gcc's -Wundef and GNU ld's '-Wl-zdefs' options and hard fail
the build the remaining undefined symbol problems that are hiding could be
fleshed out quickly during a day or so of the development cycle.  The Imake
(or autotool in the future) build process could be automated to test wether
the installed gcc and ld support these commandline options or not and
automatically enable the flags if the gcc/ld support it.

The result would be that on Linux at least and possibly other OS's bugs
associated with undefined symbols due to improper linking would no longer
occur.  Since most of these issues end up not being noticed for quite some
time it would permanently wipe out this class of bug more or less (on 
Linux at least).

I mentioned this to a few people in IRC recently who felt the idea had
a lot of merit for future X.Org releases and suggested I file it in
Xorg bugzilla in case someone with some spare brain cycles was interested
in working the Imake/autotool test(s) and associated Imake config file
doctory et al. into CVS.

Here are the details:

gcc option to warn about undefined identifiers in #if directives is: -Wundef
ld option to warn about undefined symbols at link time:  -Wl-zdefs

Here is a test (from Ulrich Drepper) that can be used to test if gcc/ld
supports the link time options:

cat > test.c <<-EOF
extern void bar(void)
void foo(void){bar()}
EOF

gcc -shared -fpic -o u.so u.c -Wl-zdefs

If the above test *succeeds* the option is not supported and the gcc and ld
flags should not be modified.

If the above test fails the option is supported then -Wl-zdefs should
be added to SharedLibraryLoadFlags by changing:

#define SharedLibraryLoadFlags  -shared

to:

#define SharedLibraryLoadFlags  -shared -Wl-zdefs

This option was added to gcc on 2001-03-17 and so should work with all
stable gcc releases released after that point.  Once it's implemented for
Linux it shouldn't be hard for other OS/arch maintainers to test it on
their systems and if supported there too to enable it for them as well.

This is a simple project that someone new to X development might want to
tackle as an easy way of digging into the Imake system.",377,"1"

My system is Debian 4.0 (Etch) with X.org 7.1.1.

and change the layout to the US layout by pressing both
Alt keys at the same time the key just above the right
shift key acts like it got stuck in the Turkish keyboard
layout. To be specific it prints  and  with shift
instead of \ and | with shift. I found out that this
occurs because of a missing line in US layout's xkb
symbols file which is

/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us    on some sytems

/etc/X11/xkb/symbols/us          on other systems

With LibreOffice 4.2.3 when printing to a remote cupsd over a TCP connection the error message Could not start printer. Please check your printer configuration. is displayed but the document is still printed. This did not happen in 4.2.4. Verified with 4.2.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 and with 4.2.4 RC1 on Ubuntu 14.04.

I think this happens to the first job sent on a particular TCP connection. If I send two jobs in a row I see the message on the first job but not the second. If I wait for the CUPS connection timeout to elapse (default 5 minutes) and send another job I see the message again.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Configure CUPS to use a TCP connection: mkdir ~/.cups  echo 'ServerName 127.0.0.1' >> ~/.cups/client.conf
2. Open LibreOffice and print a document.

"DRI-105018","Kernel panic when waking up after screen goes blank.","I'm currently running on latest Manjaro XFCE with the 4.15 kernel just released and I found that the system would crash when trying to wake up after the screen went blank.

The system is an AMD Laptop (ASUS ROG STRIX GL702ZC) and the problem is 100% reproducible with the following steps:

- Lock the screen leave the screen blank for at least 3-5 minutes.
- Try wake the screen up like moving the mouse cursor.

At first I did not find the cause but after looking into the journalctl I was able to find something that appears to be a kernel panic. It existed since the beginning with the 4.14 kernel and remained unsolved even after upgrading to 4.15 kernel.

The cause seems to be dce110_vblank_set+0x4f/0xb0 [amdgpu] with the topmost call trace being dce110_vblank_set+0x4f/0xb0 [amdgpu].

The bug report here which was closed last December resembled my current issue:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2017-November/016236.html

I've thought about the possibility of it being DC-related as I saw similar bug reports but I was wrong as at one time I was able to reproduce it even after passing amdgpu.dc=0 during boot. The modules don't seem to be related as it happened on fresh installs where I left the screen blank (before I actually adjusted power management options) as I let it download and install packages I wanted in the background.

Additionally I'm able to find some additional errors prior to the crash which might have happened when the screen went blank. It could be done by simply locking the screen and leave it as is. (NOTE: When I locked the screen and then immediately move the mouse cursor to wake it up the crash would not occur. It would only occur if the screen went blank for at least 3-5 minutes.)

For now I could only prevent the panic from happening by not allowing power saving functions to happen especially anything that would turn off the screen. I'm also not allowed to lock the screen it would also blank the screen and the GTK+ greeter could blank the screen in its own way. 

However it's not feasible for running the system on battery for an extended period without any power saving feature given the high total TDP the laptop has and leaving the system unlocked is a bad idea in terms of security and privacy.

By the way given there were a few similar closed bug reports in the past I believe the problem might be a regression.",210,"1"
"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-94407","the description of the ctrl_modifier option is not precise enough","Created attachment 122119
gives a special option a distinctive description

Judging from the description (Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl) the caps:ctrl_modifier option /changes/ the  key into a Ctrl key -- just like the other six options that say Make Caps Lock an additional ....  But it does something more: it also still produces the Caps_Lock symbol.

So the first patch differentiates the description from the other six and tries to describe the functionality concisely.

The second patch then reorders some options so that they have the same order both in the rules file and in the symbols file.",29,"0"

Two issues showed up recently:

1. When receiving multiple events in the same SyncML session with a custom timezone definition importing the timezone worked for the first event but then failed to reuse the definition for the following event. It used UTC instead. Observed on the iPhone Synthesis app fix related to matchTZ() will be available soonish.

2. A VTIMEZONE with TZID including commas is not imported correctly. The TZID needs to be unescaped:

dmesg from UX31A running under 3.10.5 with drm.debug=0xe

This has been reported in ALT Linux bugzilla (in Russian) posting here at Kirill's request as I've confirmed a report by another user on the same hardware I happen to use.

3.10.x kernels up to and including 3.10.5 result in turning off the backlight at i915 module load time on ASUS UX31A (i7-3517U) dmesg with drm.debug=0xe and late module load (not in initrd) is attached external VGA monitor works fine (dmesg and Xorg.1.log available if needed).

Here's a transcript of sysfs knob fiddling over ssh:

root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat actual_brightness 
0
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat max_brightness 
4302
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # echo 800 > brightness       
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat actual_brightness       
4302

and corresponding bits of dmesg (including further attempts at putting 100 and 80 values into brightness both resulted in actual_brightness reading the same values but the screen backlight is still off):

[  877.052934] [drm:intel_panel_actually_set_backlight] set backlight PWM = 4302
[  881.868818] [drm:intel_panel_get_backlight] get backlight PWM = 4302

"XORG-16522","Add configure option to set NOFONTSERVERACCESS (patch included)","Created attachment 17378
Add configure option --disable-fc which disables font server support

In libXfont-1.3.1 there is the configure option --disable-fc which disables the code to connect to a font server. In xorg-server-1.4.2 in confdefs.h there is the #define NOFONTSERVERACCESS but the only way to set it is by passing --enable-builtin-fonts to configure.

I think it can be useful to compile an X server which only supports client-side fonts but does not have them built into the server itself. Therefore I would like to have a configure option to set the NOFONTSERVERACCESS #define.

I attached a patch that adds the --disable-fc configure option which sets NOFONTSERVERACCESS. It required adding one #ifndef in dix/dixfonts.c all other changes are in configure.ac.

The existing --enable-builtin-fonts option implies --disable-fc. This is handled by giving the fc option the default value auto which acts as enabled. If --enable-builtin-fonts is given a warning is printed and fc is forcibly disabled.

An alternative would be to silently disable fc if it was in auto mode and raise an error if it was in enabled mode (explicitly enabled by the user). I usually prefer programs to refuse invalid inputs instead of automatically correcting them. However I looked for similar situations in configure.ac and saw that for example --disable-dga is handled by printing a warning and forced disabling so I conformed to that.",808,"1"
"POPPLER-102880","Missing chars in rendered PDF","Created attachment 134339
PDF which shows the problem

When rendering the attached PDF with actual poppler some chars are not shown. Looking into it I figured out that the included truetype font has no cmap table and try the TrueType 'post' table to handle any unmapped characters is not working correctly because in FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() some chars were skipped.

With xpdf 4.00 the PDF is shown correctly.

Comparing poppler code of FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() with the xpdf code 4.00 I encountered that this bug was probably introduced with a patch I uploaded for bug 84270.

But reverting FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() from poppler to the xpdf 4.00 code doesn't only renders this PDF correctly it renders also the PDF of bug 84270 correctly.

And since the xpdf 4.00 code is cleaner I would prefer to take over this code again!",100,"0"

"XORG-19608","Latest Intel driver (2.6) requests libdrm (2.4.4) - incomplete build directory","I'm having trouble installing the new Intel driver at http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2008Q4.html.
Specifically this is about xf86-video-intel 2.6.0 for an Intel GME965 chipset.
I'm running Fedora 10 2.6.27.9-159.fc10.i686.

I think it all stems from an incomplete libdrm installation due to a missing build directory (linux-core):

In libdrm-2.4.4 directory:
# more README 

    There are two main parts to this package: the DRM client library/interface
    (libdrm.so) and kernel/hardware-specific device modules (such as i915.ko).
    Compiling
    ---------
    By default libdrm and the DRM header files will install into /usr/local/.
    If you want to install this DRM to replace your system copy say:
	    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    Then
	    make install

    To build the device-specific kernel modules:
	    cd linux-core/
	    make
	    cp *.ko /lib/modules/VERSION/kernel/drivers/char/drm/
	       (where VERSION is your kernel version: uname -f)
    Or
	    cd bsd-core/
	    make
	    copy the kernel modules to the appropriate place


I did part one and everything completed normally.  Actually I added make to the process because that's the usual order of operations.
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    make
    make install

However I can't do part 2 because there is no directory called linux-core.  I did see a directory called shared core.  Here's the listing:

# ls
aclocal.m4    config.status  configure.ac  libdrm        libtool    Makefile.am  README
config.guess  config.sub     depcomp       libdrm.pc     ltmain.sh  Makefile.in  shared-core
config.log    configure      install-sh    libdrm.pc.in  Makefile   missing      tests

# cd shared-core/
# ls
drm.h       drm_sarea.h  mach64_drm.h  Makefile.am  mga_drm.h      r128_drm.h  radeon_drm.h  sis_drm.h     via_drm.h
drm_mode.h  i915_drm.h   Makefile      Makefile.in  nouveau_drm.h  r300_reg.h  savage_drm.h  via_3d_reg.h  xgi_drm.h

# make
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

-------------------
So one of two things should be fixed: the README file (maybe there is no part 2 any more) or the linux-core directory needs to be added.

Thanks!  Let me know if you need more info.

"POLICYKIT-25798","polkit-backend-1 headers do not reference polkit properly","Created attachment 32296
clean up polkitbackend headers

Hi I am currently working on PolicyKit bindings for vala and have come across a few mistakes in the polkit-backend-1 headers. For example polkitbackendactionlookup.h references PolkitDetails without including polkit.h. This causes bindings generation to fail as the generator doesn't know about the objects that haven't been #included.

Attached is a patch to fix all issues of this kind. In addition it introduces consistency in #include style (using  instead of foo.h) and makes polkitbackend.h check for _POLKIT_BACKEND_COMPILATION as opposed to POLKIT_BACKEND_COMPILATION which is what the other headers do as well.

The patch was made against release 0.95 and while there have been some changes in git since then I don't think they affect the patch.",227,"1"
"POPPLER-98537","pdftoppm -tiff -gray/-mono generates wrong image","Hi.

pdftoppm -tiff -gray generates horizontally 3x stretched image.
pdftoppm -tiff -mono generates a kind of messed up image.

TiffWriter::writePointers and
TiffWriter::writeRow seem to accept native rowData (1bpp and 8bpp) rather than 24bpp RGB pixel format.

I have fixed it by adding supportNativeMonoRowData to ImgWriter.

My commit/patch is here. This can be used to fix the problem! However the branch pdftoppm-pdftotif also contains my extra stuff like -singletiff option.

"LIBREOFFICE-43984","Update VCL.xcu for Chinese (Traditional) language","Created attachment 54600
Upate the Chinese fonts list to fit the situation nowdays.

Chinese (Traditional) language has two variants zh-tw and zh-hk.

The old VCL.xcu has some fonts which are not common on major platform (Windows Linux and Mac) but used by StarSuite and some outdated free fonts for Chinese (Traditional). It didn't support MacOS X yet so I edit it to fit the situation today.


Goals:

1. Remove fonts provided only by StarSuite: 方正明體 MSung Light TC 方正黑体

2. Remove outdated free Chinese fonts which is not maintained anymore: AR PL Mingti2L Big5 文鼎PL細上海宋Uni AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni 文鼎ＰＬ新宋 AR PL New Sung 文鼎PL中楷Uni AR PL ZenKai Uni

3. Add 文泉驛微米黑 文泉驛等寬微米黑 and AR PL UMing TW or AR PL UMing HK which are almost all the default fonts for Chinese in Linux distributions to appropriate sections and set them to the first priority to let fontconfig can pick it right away.

4. Add 黑體-繁 (Heiti TC) 儷黑 Pro (LiHei Pro) and 儷宋 Pro (LiSong Pro) which are the default Chinese font in MacOS 10.6 and before to the second priority. System will pick those fonts before the fonts come from Windows platform (eg. 微軟正黑體新細明體 (PMingLiU)細明體 (MingLiU)) to fit Mac's look and feel.


I would like it be release at testing builds as soon as possible to let Chinese (Traditional) users to test about this update.",27,"0"

This problem has plagued me for as long as I've been running Linux with this

Whenever there is a lot of display activity I get junk all over the screen. This
seems to be related to how the hardware is handled since I cannot do a screen
shot of the effect. Basically it smears out random stuff from the screen over
random portions. The randomness in this changes constantly so it appears more
or less like static over the screen.

Scrolling or dragging large windows will cause this effect.
Video will cause this effect to the extreme. The smaller I make the video window
the more of this effect shows up. Above a certain size the effect stops. The
higher resolution of the movie the more problems (and larger threshold size).",812,"1"

If you start with a completely empty start menu it adds all components. But few people have that. Assuming that there is only one slot at the bottom of the most used program list it will add base and to the extent that there are other slots it adds components in alphabetical order. 

My suggested fix would be either to add things in reverse alphabetical order or to use the main Libre Office start item.",219,"1"

distortions on external display

I have a notebook with switchable graphics (discrete ATI Mobility Radeon HD 
5650 and integrated Intel Arrandale). The DisplayPort only works with the 
discrete adapter but this limitation also exists in Windows so I guess the 
DisplayPort is hard-wired to the discrete card.

If I use the radeon driver it detects whenever I plug something into the 
DisplayPort. E.g. I have a DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter (for projectors) and 
test it with my LCD monitor that luckily has a VGA input too. xrandr detects 
the connection and suggests the correct resolution and frequency (1680x1050 
@60Hz). But the image is totally distorted. It looks like a old tube monitor 
that runs a too high frequency you can see this on the attached screenshot. What you cannot see is that the distortions move quite fast and are not static.

I switched back to 1024x768@60Hz but the problem persists and the optional 75.1Hz do not make any difference too.

The same settings work fine with Windows so I suspect this issue to be caused by the radeon driver.

Is there any way to see what's going wrong and maybe fix this?

IMHO this needs at least to be handled a bit more graceful - letting the user know what's the problem.

"POPPLER-37189","patch to fix a bad memory access when a character starts to the left of the image","Created attachment 46698
Sample file to show the problem

When Splash::fillGlyph2() draws a character if the starting X location is negative it increments the pointer to the glyph data to start at the position in the glyph data that should go at X position 0.
If glyph->aa is set the glyph data is one byte per pixel and the increment by abs(x start) is correct.
If glyph->aa is not set the glyph data is one byte per 8 pixels and the increment should be by abs(x start)/8 and the loop that scans the data should be offset by abs(x start)%8.
Splash::fillGlyph2() currently adds the same increment of abs(x start) whether or not glyph->aa is set and when glyph->aa is not set drawing a character with a negative X position can cause a bad memory reference.  For example running

everything goes okay except for the fact that the display doesn't get a signal. This can be remedied by executing some bit-banging:

Then the display is enabled however since the driver is unaware of this hack I have to execute it again after switching to the console or suspending. In addition to this the display keeps getting a signal so it won't enter a powersave mode.

extract from kern.log

Hi there

I'm using a X GIT setup that's around 2 days old. I'm experiencing random X server lockups with the kernel still active (I could restart the system via ACPI).
X however was locked I couldn't use keyboard to kill it.

I already experienced this thrice a snip from the kernel log is attached. It seems to have something to do with the i915 DRM kernel module.

The kernel module libdrm mesa and xorg-server were built from GIT. Like I said the age is around 2 days.

Distro is gentoo linux I'm not using any fancy optimization options - so this should not be a problem.

uname -a:
Linux leena 2.6.25-gentoo-r4 #1 Sun May 25 14:57:33 CEST 2008 i686 Intel(R) Celeron(R) M processor 1.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

lspci:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 03)

Each time this happens (X goes static then screen goes black fades like the server tries some restarting comes up but stays black only with the cursor still there) multiple BUGs appear in kern.log.

I separated the occurences with two empty lines each.

Following is my analisys and a possible patch:

ModemManager tries to set default storages for MEM2 and MEM3 only with `+CPMS` providing an empty string for MEM1 argument::

     [1448531013.833175] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=MEME'

     [1448531013.967401] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:792] set_default_storage_ready(): Couldn't set default storage: 'Operation not supported'

Some modems do support NULL arguments (considering that as a request to do not change the correspondant value) but passing an empty string should be considered invalid since it is not a supported value::

     [1448531007.342611] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=?'
     [1448531007.389244] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): '
     [1448531007.418215] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): OK'

According to the previous logs only SM and ME are supported strings so the command should at most be `AT+CPMS=MEME`

However HE910 does not support NULL argument either so I made the following changes in order to provide always the current value of MEM1 if no other value is provided
this way the code works fine with HE910 and should work with the other modems too since it's conservative::

"SYSTEMD-65818","systemd gets stuck in loop with ConditionACPower in timer activated service","Created attachment 80900
backup service

I use the attached service and timer units for backup purposes. The service file contains ConditionACPower=yes because I don't want the backup to run when the power isn't plugged in.

This works as expected as long as the power is plugged in. If however the service is triggered by the timer while the power is unplugged systemd gets stuck in a loop. CPU usage by systemd goes up to about 75% systemd-journal up to 35% and the journal is flooded with the following message:

Jun 16 12:17:42 mus-laptop systemd[1]: Started Backup laptop

Every 10 seconds the following is logged followed by another few hundred Started backup-laptop messages:

Note that this doesn't happen when I trigger the service manually only if it is triggered by the timer. The loop stops as soon as I stop the timer.

systemctl status backup-laptop shows the following while it is stuck in the loop:

    drm/i915: Only unpin the default ctx object if it exists

    Since commit 691e6415c891b8b2b082a120b896b443531c4d45
    Author: Chris Wilson 
    Date:   Wed Apr 9 09:07:36 2014 +0100

        drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

    we have contexts everywhere and so we must be careful to distinguish
    fake contexts which do not have an associated bo and real ones which
    do. In particular we now need to be careful not to dereference NULL
    pointers.

    This is one such example as the commit highlighted above failed to move
    the unpinning of the default ctx object into the real-context-only
    branch.

    drm/i915: Increase WM memory latency values on SNB

    On SNB the BIOS provided WM memory latency values seem insufficient to
    handle high resolution displays.

    In this particular case the display mode was a 2560x1440@60Hz which
    makes the pixel clock 241.5 MHz. It was empirically found that a memory
    latency value if 1.2 usec is enough to avoid underruns whereas the BIOS
    provided value of 0.7 usec was clearly too low. Incidentally 1.2 usec
    is what the typical BIOS provided values are on IVB systems.

    Increase the WM memory latency values to at least 1.2 usec on SNB.
    Hopefully this won't have a significant effect on power consumption.

    v2: Increase the latency values regardless of the pixel clock

intel/fs: Introduce regioning lowering pass.

This legalization pass is meant to handle situations where the source
or destination regioning controls of an instruction are unsupported by
the hardware and need to be lowered away into separate instructions.
This should be more reliable and future-proof than the current
approach of handling CHV/BXT restrictions manually all over the
visitor.  The same mechanism is leveraged to lower unsupported type
conversions easily which obsoletes the lower_conversions pass.

v2: Give conditional modifiers the same treatment as predicates for
    SEL instructions in lower_dst_modifiers() (Iago).  Special-case a
    couple of other instructions with inconsistent conditional mod
    semantics in lower_dst_modifiers() (Curro).

"UPOWER-60214","upower battery level off by power of 10","upower thinks my batter is at 8% when many other indicators say it's at 92% (and that's the level that makes sense). This is on a MacBook Air from mid-2011 (42 IIRC) running Arch Linux (so always a recent kernel) and I've experienced and tolerated this odd issue since I bought it in early 2012.

Anyway as you can see upower thinks energy-full is 10 times higher than it really is but I can't quite see in sysfs why it thinks that.

"LIBCANBERRA-24139","Assumption every GdkWindow has a X window crashes Epiphany recovery dialog","Full bug report including trace:
https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54010

Description of problem:
Epiphany crashed and after I tried to restart it the Recovery dialog appeared.
Then it crashes again regardless of the recover/don't recover choice with
this output on the console:

[reinout@localhost ~]$ epiphany
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module pk-gtk-module: libpk-gtk-module.so: kan
gedeeld objectbestand niet openen: Bestand of map bestaat niet

(epiphany:19360): Gdk-WARNING **: gdkdrawable-x11.c:952 drawable is not a
pixmap or window
The program 'epiphany' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 1188 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
2.27.92
-------------------
irc conversation:
 looks like a libcanberra bug
 it assumes every GdkWindow has a X window which isn't true anymore for gtk
2.18
 so it calls XGetWindowProperty on None window which naturally doesn't work
 chpe: that doesn't explain why this wasn't a  problem before
epiphany crashed does it? Or is that just coincidence?
 maybe it's the recovery dialogue
 maybe canberra tries to play a sound for it?
 possibly
 let me try to disable sound
 bingo that's it",20,"0"

How to reproduce:

Boot without X (runlevel 3) and with drm.debug=0xff
Login as root on the console.
Captured the register dump with: intel_reg_dumper > regs.1
Set-up netconsole (quite a bit of mucking here with firewire to trigger kernel messages)
Captured dmesg with dmesg > dmesg.2.log
I plug an external monitor on the VGA port.
A bunch of messages fly on the netconsole (netconsole.out).
The computer locks up shortly after.  No oops captured.",57,"0"

"XORG-32098","constness of argument names in XInternAtoms() is incorrect.","The type of the names argument to XInternAtoms has been changed from char ** to const char **. GCC chokes on this when passed char ** values.

changing the signature to char const * const * or even char const * const * const would make the correct thing happen in the case where non-const values are being promoted to contness in the call to this function.

Most of these are due to several Calc Function pages that use a common footer to direct the user to openoffice.org website for more help.  Similarly the same search in WikiHelp turns up even more hits because the Calc Func help pages were localized into many languages.  This occurs in in a fresh build of branch libreoffice-3-4-0 - believe it affects all versions. 
Some of the hits are entirely valid - OO.org is used to identify the initial version of OO.org for important features like ODF format support.

    igt/gem_userptr_blits: Fix up last minute API changes

    When the patch was merged the ioctl numbers had to be adjusted to leave
    no holes. Also there was a final piece of munging of the API to
    downgrade unsynced userptr for export over dma-buf.

"SYSTEMD-89048","DOC: the man pages should clarify that systemctl daemon-reload is the way to make systemd reread /etc/fstab","Hi

http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.mount.html#fstab reads that:

Mount units may either be configured via unit files or via /etc/fstab (see fstab(5) for details). Mounts listed in /etc/fstab will be converted into native units dynamically at boot and when the configuration of the system manager is reloaded. In general configuring mount points through /etc/fstab is the preferred approach. See systemd-fstab-generator(8) for details about the conversion.

Once the user modifies the /etc/fstab it is difficult to find out how to regenerate the units. Usual advice given by many is to reload the configuration systemctl daemon-reload which does not do the trick.

Running /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator does not change existing units (systemctl list-units --all) either.

Someone on Arch Linux forum adviced that /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator /run/systemd/generator '' '' should work.

Not obvious from the man pages of systemd-fstab-generator which mentions something in Examples but without any reference to the actual location.

systemd-fstab-generator converts /etc/fstab into native mount units. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated unit files in order to allow the user to override fstab with his own native unit files but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any vendor default from /usr.

Looking at it from today's perspective it may seem clear - just read and understand a buch of man pages. But without knowing the actual command argument syntax I guess I would have to stay with the easy-to-carry-out reboots of the computer. The old style was simply mount -a written directly in the man page.

How about an equivalent for systemd-fstab-generator which would simply carry out the default task which is done during boot?",2,"0"

"DBUS-55729","[PATCH] Add accessor to return the DBusGConnection from the DBusGMethodInvocation","Created attachment 68212
Add accessor to return the DBusGConnection that a DBusGMethodInvocation was invoked on

For NetworkManager we're adding support for a private bus socket so that NM can be used in early-boot environments without a bus daemon running.  That means we're setting up a DBusServer object on a private socket and making dbus-glib aware of the connections that appear on that socket.

Since the authentication paths depend on which DBusGConnection the method invocation comes from as the private socket only accepts connections from root and since messages from the private socket don't have sender addresses we need to figure out which DBusGConnection the DBusGInvocation is associated with so we can short-circuit authentication checks and always allow any connections from the private socket.

Unfortunately we can't get at the DBusGConnection without doing something like:

DBusGConnection *gconn = (DBusGConnection *) context

which is a complete hack.  So I'd like to formalize this since it seems useful :)",58,"0"
"LIBREOFFICE-76486","Uniform Arrangement of the Help Button","Problem Description: 
In some dialog boxes the help button is arranged on the left while in other dialog boxes it is on the right next to buttons like OK and Cancel.
 
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open WRITER

2.1. Go to INSERT -> FOOTNOTE/ENDNOTE
2.2. Go to INSERT -> OBJECT -> PLUG-IN
2.3. Go to FILE -> PROPERTIES -> tab SECURITY -> PROTECT
2.4. Go to TABLE -> INSERT -> TABLE
2.5. Go to TOOLS -> WORD COUNT

versus:

3.1. Go to FILE -> EXPORT AS PDF
3.2. Go to FILE -> PROPERTIES -> any tab
3.3. Go to INSERT -> SPECIAL CHARACTER
3.4. Go to INSERT -> FRAME -> any tab
3.5. Go to TOOLS -> LINE NUMBERING

Maybe it would be good to have a uniform arrangement of the help buttons (left or right) to make it more intuitive and faster to find the help buttons?
What do others think about this?

"XORG-19493","[i945GM] Secondary X session goes white if compiz activated","https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/269509

[Problem]
On this hardware starting a second session and activating compiz leads to a white screen presumably because the second session is assuming DRI is present when it isn't.

[Discussion]
Ubuntu has a 'Guest session' feature which allows starting a second X session.  It is said that DRI is not available for anything but the primary session which is unfortunate but acceptable.  However when starting the xserver on a second session it does not seem to be smart enough to realize it should not try using DRI because it consequently presents a blank white non-interactive screen.

Expected behavior would be for it to realize DRI is unavailable and load without DRI enabled.

Compiz currently works around this by including a check for 'Software Rasterizer' in its startup script.  However we'd like to not need to work around this issue like that as it's kind of a hack.

	Subsystem: Dell Device [1028:0201]

[Original Report]
Compiz recently started by default again thanks to some fixes in gnome-session. Now the old problem of second X session just has white screen is back. Parrotting Michael this is due to the X server pretending that it has two DRI capable screens but it is a known problem that there can only be one compiz X.org at a time.

I'll attach glxinfo output from my primary session (with compiz running fine) and the output from the guest session (where I just get a white screen).

> I tried reproducing it on my 965 box but couldn't would you mind
> listing the exact steps to reproduce it?

for glxinfo:
- boot
- log into GNOME
- glxinfo > glxinfo.primarysession.txt
- start guest session
- glxinfo > /tmp/glxinfo.guest.txt
- switch to primary session with ctrl+alt+f7 (since quitting the guest
  session kills all files of guest)
- copy /tmp/glxinfo.guest.txt to ~
- switch back to guest and close the session

For checking white screen:
 - edit /usr/bin/compiz and disable the abort_* thing in

        # check if we run with software rasterizer and if so bail out
        if check_software_rasterizer then
                verbose Software rasterizer detected aborting

recording of the described behaviour

Description of problem:

I have two screens connected one using DisplayPort one using DVI. The problem also occurs when both are connected using DVI.
Rotating one of the screens by 90° results in a black screen sometimes filled with artefacts. The mouse pointer still works on that screen however no windows show up. This occurs under Cinnamon Plasma and i3 using the onboard tools of the two former ones or xrandr on the latter. The radeon driver spams the syslog with lines like:

This has been discussed in http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2015-February/059291.html  filing it here so it can be better tracked.

Beginning with kernel 3.19-rc1 there are warnings generated by the i915 from the function intel_check_page_flip. A dmesg log from boot to the problem with `drm.debug=13` is attached. This only happens when booting with threaded IRQs enabled by the `threadirqs` kernel flag. 

As pointed out on the mailing lists this is probably caused because in_irq() only tests for real hardware interrupts not threaded ones. Further information here: http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2015-February/059623.html

---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-10 10:33:59 +0000 ----

BUILD IMAGE:         SyncEvolution 1.1.99.5

BUG DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
===========================================================

Evolution shows detached recurrences twice.

EXACT STEPS LEADING TO PROBLEM:
===========================================================
1. get your Google account invited to a meeting series from someone using Exchange
2. have the organizer modify (not delete!) one recurrence
3. sync with Evolution via CalDAV

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
===================
Regular meeting show except for the one modified recurrence which must show the updated information.


ACTUAL OUTCOME:
===================
Evolution shows the meeting twice on the day of the modified recurrence.


USER IMPACT:
===================
Doesn't know which event is the up-to-date one.


REPRODUCIBILITY:
=====================================
100%


OTHER COMMENTS:
===================

Occurs because the detached recurrence generated this way contains a RECURRENCE-ID in UTC. I suspect that this is legal according to the RFC and that there is an Evolution/libical bug here.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-10 10:57:07 +0000 ----

commit c50b45865c5c271b1d3d26cdeb938b8d48f12d0a
Author: Patrick Ohly 
Date:   Wed Aug 10 12:43:44 2011 +0200

    CalDAV: transform UTC RECURRENCE-ID for Evolution (BMC #22594)
    
    Evolution shows a meeting twice on the day of a modified recurrence
    if the meeting series was originally created and modified in Exchange
    then imported into Google Calendar.
    
    The reason is that the RECURRENCE-ID in that case ends up being
    in UTC even if the parent event has a time zone. Evolution and/or
    libical seem to have a bug here IMHO they should recognize that the
    RECURRENCE-ID time is the same.
    
    SyncEvolution now works around this by transforming the UTC
    RECURRENCE-ID time into the time zone of the DTSTART time of the
    parent event. This is combined with removal of X-LIC-ERRORS into
    a new fixIncomingCalendar() method which needs to be called
    whenever a complete VCALENDAR is received from the CalDAV server
    (adding data from a report GET).
    
    This transformation changes the rid part of the item IDs. It should
    be okay in a two-way sync (remove one sub item add another) and
    a slow sync (libsynthesis recognizes the times as equal).

Having a filter list as an extra method is okay (see bug 41908) but it's not the traditional method and silently changing the behavior is a potential security risk.

If in keeping with the (in my opinion ill-advised) shift to capabilities it is deemed desirable to go with a configurable lower limit on numeric user ids and a filter list there should at least be some serious public discussion (as on distro user lists) before the change is implemented and there should be an incubation period during which both the filter list and the nologin shell are recognized.

I personally would prefer the traditional behavior be kept. There is no reason on desktops or servers for /bin/nologin users to be offered the opportunity to log in in most cases. For those that prefer a separate filter list the configuration file could be allowed to override the traditional behavior on a per-user basis whether to show or hide. (Reference bug 41908.)

If the change was made to accommodate wireless carriers who might be deluded about the ability to keep the platform more secure by preventing all non-graphical logins it would be better to add a /bin/guiloginonly default shell value.

Filtering on lack of specified password is a good option but is also contrary to traditional administration techniques. If such behavior is to be included it should be set or unset in the configuration files as well.",84,"0"

"XORG-99220","Depth=32 not redrawn correctly (CopyArea has no effect)","The window manager called awesome by default uses depth=32 for its windows. This causes the following problem. When starting with the argument `--no-argb` which makes it use the root's depth and visual instead the problem does not occur.

* Start awesome
* Start a terminal (Mod4+Enter in the default config)
* Switch to tag 2 (tag=workspace Mod4+2 in the default config)
* Notice that the taglist at the top of the screen now has 2 highlighted
* Switch back to tag 1 (Mod4+1)
* Notice that the taglist *still* has the 2 highlighted

When one now moves the terminal over the taglist (click+drag on the titlebar) the exposed areas are redrawn correctly.

Awesome draws to a pixmap and when done does a CopyArea request to update the window. Expose events are handled in the same way.

I have several reasons to think that this is a bug in the server:

* `--no-argb` / using the default depth and visual makes the problem go away
* Exposure shows the expected content hence the pixmap used for double buffering has the right content
* People reported that switching video drivers caused the problem or made it go away.

Also the following patch fixes the problem. The effect of the patch should be to update all windows with automatic redirection (depth=32 but parent has another depth) needlessly all the time. The word needlessly here shows that something is wrong but I cannot figure out what (the patch should not make a difference but it does!). The damage extension seems to report things correctly but still the composite extension code sees an empty damage area...

Xorg.0.log

My laptop is an HP Envy 17 3D. I am running Gentoo and using vgaswitcheroo to switch between radeon and intel (i915). I have the radeon driver working with some difficulty (see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58894) - i.e. I have to attach an external monitor to get the laptop screen turned on after KDE has started.

I would like to be able to use the intel driver and switch off the radeon chip because it uses much less power. I can do this using vgaswitcheroo but the intel driver gives me 2 problems:

1) The laptop screen stays black after the boot process has completed. If I attach an external monitor I can get a picture on that but the laptop screen just stays black.

2) Moving the mouse pointer to the top left corner (rather the top left square of maybe 1/3 of the screen) the screen starts to flicker from the mouse pointer and downwards.

I also notice that it takes quite a while before KDE displays anything during the boot with the intel driver enabled compared to the time it takes if the radeon driver is used.

"FONTCONFIG-116","ka.orth and Georgian capital forms","I believe that ka.orth (Georgian) should not include the
range from U+10A0 to U+10C5 

Reasoning:

 - Section 7.5 of the Unicode standard says:

        Case Forms. The Georgian alphabet is fundamentally caseless and
        is used as such in most texts. The scholar Akaki Shanidze
        attempted to introduce a casing practice for Georgian in the
        1950s but it failed to gain popularity. In this typographic
        departure the Asomtavruli forms serve to represent uppercase
        letters while the lowercase is Mkhedruli or Nuskhuri. [...] The
        Unicode encoding of Georgian follows the Latin analogy: The
        range U+10A0..U+10CF is used to encode the uppercase capital
        forms (Asomtavruli) and the basic alphabetic range
        U+10D0..U+10FF may be regarded as lowercase (Mkhedruli or
        Nuskhuri).  [...]

 - The font that Microsoft ships with Windows XP that covers 
   Georgian (SylfaenARM) includes only the lowercase forms so
   currently does not get picked up by ka.orth.",0,"0"

    gallivm: fix improper clamping of vertex index when fetching gs inputs
    
    Because we only have one file_max for the (2d) gs input file the value
    actually represents the max of attrib and vertex index (although I'm
    not entirely sure if we really want the max since the max valid value
    of the vertex dimension can be easily deduced from the input primitive).
    
    Thus in cases where the number of inputs is higher than the number of
    vertices per prim we did not properly clamp the vertex index which
    would result in out-of-bound fetches potentially causing segfaults
    (the segfaults seemed actually difficult to trigger but valgrind
    certainly wasn't happy). This might have happened even if the shader
    did not actually try to fetch bogus vertices if the fetching happened
    in non-active conditional clauses.
    
    To fix simply use the correct max vertex index value (derived from
    the input prim type) instead when clamping for this case.

GDB backtrace and register dump of the crash

While running Piglit quick on a R9 290 (see below for the full stack) I encountered a crash in src/gallium/drivers/radeon/radeon_setup_tgsi_llvm.c on line 1153 in the emit_immediate function triggered by running spec/ARB_fragment_program/fp-long-alu. The attached file contains a full backtrace and a register dump. Let me know if you need something else.

This might be a duplicate of bug 82477 (or at least caused by that) but since the crash happend somewhere else I filed my own report.

The reason is that we are using font metrics to compute the stretch ratio for autofit but that collides with nPropr property of SvxFont - it is then counted twice ie. in the case of nPropr == 25 we actually behave as if it was much less and worse only in the horizontal direction.",0,"0"

Xavier implemented this for telepathy-glib:

I need to get MC the CMs and Folks' regression tests caught up and fix anything that I don't like about Xavier's implementation.",1,"0"

HD Graphics 530 when I am switching to full screen window on i3wm and back it takes long time like its on heavy load. When I am watching movie and doing someting else on other monitor it skips frames until operation is done - mostly when I am switching to full screen also on slim also . It doesn't happen on SNA or BLT but  when I switch into SNA or BLT it doesn't render properly my movie when I am switching for example to full screen on my player only player controls goes into full screen the view of the movie is staying at the same resolution it was. Also on SNA and BLT  I get some flickers on when I am typing login into slim manager. 
On UXA also switching tabs on firefox takes lot of time. 
The similar problems I am experiencing on KDE.

So I decided to test the support for monster paragraphs thing.

I downloaded the original test file on Apache Bugzilla[1] and decided to type few characters more.

"XORG-93554","X.org crashes intermittently randomly on Intel graphics","As reported in (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/1522727).

Since upgrading to Ubuntu 15.10 X.org crashes intermittently. The screen will suddenly turn black and after a few seconds the LightDM login screen appears. All unsaved work is lost of course.

A clean install of 15.10 did not help the problem persists.

It happens absolutely randomly. I haven't been able to figure out any pattern related to time or specific user interaction that would cause this except that I believe the crash is always triggered by some kind of input device action i.e. mouse click or key press. The system won't crash if I don't actively do any work.

"PORTLAND-13435","xdg-email - Thunderbird does not support email attachments","On http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/EmailConfig it says Moziila Thunderbird does not support email attachments from xdg-email.

It turns out Thunderbird disabled attachments via a mailto: URL on purpose because they believe it is not secure. [1]

I'm proposing the following workaround: (see attachment)

In open_kde() / open_gnome() look up the email client kde/gnome is trying to run. If the client contains Thunderbird in its name then call run_thunderbird() which parses the mailto url reformats it in a way that Thunderbird accepts and then run Thunderbird.

open_xfce() does not need to do this because exo-open already does this. [2]

    drm/i915: create vmas at execbuf

    In order to transition more of our code over to using a VMA instead of
    an  pair - we must have the vma accessible at execbuf time. Up
    until now we've only had a VMA when actually binding an object.

    The previous patch helped handle the distinction on bound vs. unbound.
    This patch will help us catch leaks and other issues before we actually
    shuffle a bunch of stuff around.

    The subsequent patch to fix up the rest of execbuf should be mostly just
    moving code around and this is the major functional change.

    v2: Release table_lock earlier so vma allocation needn't be atomic.
    (Chris)

"CAIRO-60489","Artifacts being introduced in SVG rendering to PNG in versions later than 1.10.2","Created attachment 74421
Test SVG file for script scaling.py

The 1.12.2 and 1.12.10 versions of libcairo2 introduces a rendering bug that was not present in version 1.10.2. It is possible the bug may also be in later versions.

The rendering problem shows up when using the rsvg utility to convert the attached SVG file to PNG format. (See package librsvg2-bin) 

TO REPRODUCE THE BUG
On my machine I am running Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 which has libcairo2-1.12.2. Save the attached file 'waterfall.svg.gz' and Python script 'scaling.py' into a test directory. Unzip the SVG file with gunzip. Make sure package librsvg2-bin is installed.

File: scaling.py
import subprocess
for width in range (400 900 100):
    print 'Converting to width:' width
    subprocess.call (['rsvg' '--width' str (width) 'waterfall.svg' waterfall.%s.png' % width])

Run the script from the command line. The script outputs 5 PNG files ranging in width from 400 to 800. The first and last PNG do not have any problem but the 500 600 and 700 width files all have major artifacts.

TESTING VARIOUS LIBCAIRO2 VERSIONS
Create a subdirectory 'libs'. Into this directory extract the shared object 'libcairo.so.2.xxxxx.x' for various versions. Select the one for testing by creating a link. This selects the 1.10.2 version:

    ln libs/libcairo.so.2.11000.2 libs/libcairo.so.2

set the library path as follows

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs

Run the test script again and examine the output. You will find that the 1.10.2 version produces images without any artifacts.

This bug has also been reported here with a different wording.+

Rotate documents correctly

I've tried to rotate a PostScript file from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1031838 in evince and the rotation was not quite correct. It doesn't show anything for 90° and 270° just warnings about matrices. So I've tested this also with some other PostScript files and I've seen that the rotation doesn't work for any of them.

I've prepared a patch which performs the rotation by inserting command rotate to the PostScript program right after %%EndSetup and adjusting of offsets accordingly. I've tested the patch for rendering of slices and it works. But I'm not entirely sure whether it will work in every situation.

Everything works well except the dwt is not really working (i could keep moving the mouse pointer using the touchpad even if i keep pressing a key on the keyboard). and so while i am typing the cursor will move away as it looks like a tap is detected accidentally.

At first i was thinking if it is the same issue with this bug 102649. But as Peter mentioned it should be more likely that the dwt didn't get paired with the laptop keyboard as there are two internal keyboards with exactly the same identifiers exist in the razer laptop bug 102039 comment 16.

Shaders with faulty and non faulty versions

I'm the main developer of Ogre 2.1

Our shaders produce incorrect results on Mesa. (we always use std140)

I believe the problem is caused by incorrect packing of structs. It's 05:30 am now so I couldn't double check yet.

I am attaching the Vertex shader and Pixel shader. The main and only difference between the two is that one does shadow mapping the other one doesn't.

The one doing shadow mapping just glitches. By glitches I mean colours are washed out (as if lighting was really wrong) or just black.
This happens with all of our samples where shadow mapping is done.

I believe this is caused by our unusual struct definition:

struct ShadowReceiverData
{
	mat4 texViewProj
	vec2 shadowDepthRange
	vec4 invShadowMapSize
}

struct Light
{
	vec3 position
	vec3 diffuse
	vec3 specular

	vec3 attenuation
	vec3 spotDirection
	vec3 spotParams
}
layout(binding = 0) uniform PassBuffer
{
	//Vertex shader (common to both receiver and casters)
	mat4 viewProj

	//Vertex shader
	mat4 view
	ShadowReceiverData shadowRcv[3] //This is not in the good shader

	//Pixel shader
	mat3 invViewMatCubemap

	float pssmSplitPoints0 //Not present in the good shader
	float pssmSplitPoints1 //Not present in the good shader
	float pssmSplitPoints2 //Not present in the good shader
	Light lights[1]
	
} pass

May worth noting this bug also happens on SW rasterizer because the exact same output can be seen on a virtual machine.

I'm attached the shaders both under Good and Bad folder.

I'm guessing you're gonna need more information from me so let me know what I'm missing. Ideally I would have time to track this down to the exact variable in the wrong offset but I don't have the time (and it's 05:48am already!).

You probably should add our samples to your testing suite. A lot of them don't work with Mesa and would help improve Mesa greatly.
Our code can be found at:
https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/src/dc52e186d53611b20d4f99d30266c56c29099ef7/?at=v2-1-pso
I can provide assistance compiling our samples. (or binary blobs if it's too much hassle)

Just as an example this is how our PbsSample is supposed to look: http://imgur.com/7lCnZ6h
This is how Mesa renders it (incorrectly): http://imgur.com/SfOsBgY
This is how Mesa (correctly!) renders it when shadows are disabled (Note: In the pbs sample there are 3 lights but when shadows are disabled Ogre will only use 1 light): http://imgur.com/mS1i74Y

In other samples activating shadow mapping just results in zero. My best guess is bad offset calculation.

"DBUS-27110","Port DBus-Daemon to Windows CE","Hi

this is a series of patches porting DBus-Daemon to Windows CE using cegcc cross compilation under GNU/Linux.  As Windows CE only provides a limited subset of the Windows API and an even more minimal and broken subset of the POSIX'ish Windows API I approached this port in the following way: Convert the existing Windows port fully to the Windows API replacing remnants of Unix-ish interfaces (_open _mkdir _readdir etc) by their Windows-ish counterparts (CreateFile CreateDirectory FindNextFile etc).  The advantage is that this makes the port more uniform and also avoids confusion (for example POSIXish checking of return values of Windowsish interfaces as happened for MoveFileExA).  If you are not with me on this design decision the whole set of patches needs to be abandonend (or rather: reworked).  The alternative I can think of is implementing the POSIXish interfaces for Windows CE but that may be messy as this may conflict with what's there already.  Please let me know if you feel strongly about this.

I have isolated the changes to the Windows port in a first patch (0001).  This patch is tested not to break the Windows build (the unit tests dbus-test complete successfully and a KDE program still works).  Issues addresses are among others: Use of Windows API instead of POSIXish APIs indirect use of errno (which does not(!) exist in Windows CE and needs to be replaced by Set/GetLastError).

The second patch (0002) makes more code that depends on signal.h and locale.h conditional.  These header files and associated interfaces simply don't exist on Windows CE.

The third patch (0003) adds Windows CE detection to configure.in and also adjusts the winsock library (it's -lws on CE instead of -lws_2 on NT nobody seems to know why this is different).

The fourth patch (0004) then fulfills the promise of the 0001 patch and implements the parts of the Windows API that are missing on Windows CE.  Notably it provides wrappers for the ASCII variants of the interfaces as Windows CE only has Unicode interface variants.  The alternative to switch the dbus code base to unicode is too invasive for this port (but would make large parts of this patch obsolete).

The fifth patch (0005) is an unfortunate work around for a discrepancy of the Windows NT and Windows CE command line parser in the wrapper around main() [Windows standard is to have WinMain as entry point which gets a command line string that is then parsed by the application.] Windows CE and NT have different ideas how to break the cmdline into strings for argv.  In particular Windows NT expects the first component of the cmdline to be the program name (argv[0]) while Windows CE gets the program name from the ModuleName and expects the first component of the cmdline to be the first argument (argv[1]).

The sixth patch (0006) ports the dbus-monitor.c program from tools.

The seventh patch (0007) adds a README.wince to the root directory with further information on the port.

The eighth patch (0008) includes a patched version of libtool for the build.  Current versions of libtool unfortunately don't support Windows CE cross-builds correctly: The libtool wrapper programs do not compile for this platform and there is an error in the detection order.  Note that this patch would become obsolete by upgrading to an upcoming working libtool version (our changes needed for WinCE have been submitted and accepted upstream).

I also have a port of the dbus-launch tool in the works but I want to clear the queue before cleaning that up.  I will append it to this bug report shortly.",88,"0"

    drm/i915: Create a more generic pm handler for hsw+

    HSW has some special requirements for the VEBOX. Splitting out the
    interrupt handler will make the code a bit nicer and less error prone
    when we begin to handle those.

    The slight functional change in this patch (queueing work while holding
    the spinlock) is intentional as it makes a subsequent patch a bit nicer.
    The change should also only effect HSW platforms.

LOGS

Hello

Problem description:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) hangs the GPU.


Expected Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) should not hang the GPU.


Obtained Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) freezes the system for a few seconds but afterwards (3 sec. approx.) I can close the application that caused the GPU hang.
Video output is non-existing in Cheese or Guvcview (I only see the black window where the video should be).
If I still try to take a picture with Cheese for example it will capture the photo correctly!
When playing a movie file I get no video (only sound output is available).


When does it happen: Always (no special steps are necessary to reproduce this error).

dmesg output

Hello graphics team

I am on an almost up-to-date (kernel at 4.9.4 ATM) Arch Linux system with the [testing] repository enabled. My hardware is the old integrated GPU in an AMD E2-2000 mobile CPU (Wrestler [Radeon HD 7340]) using the Radeon r600 driver.

A few weeks ago before Christmas I noticed that a stable tear appeared in movie players and games using OpenGL on X11. This was most likely caused by a package update but I did not investigate further. In hindsight the reason was most likely the package update from xf86-video-ati 7.8.0-2 -> 7.8.99.r13.g404c6475 that I performed on 2016-12-16 (There appeared an Arch bug report implicating this version [1]. The package is currently at 7.8.99.r16.gea30d856 but the problem still exists. As far as I can see nobody else reported this upstream yet.).

I have a 1366x768 display and the tear seems to appear be at a height of ~100 pixels from the top. Also it seems to start at 0x0 (from top left) with a short diagonal to about 100x100 and then reaches horizontally all the way to the right. This tear does not appear under Wayland for me. It also seems to disappear as soon as DRI3 is disabled by setting the xorg.conf option or by setting LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1 before starting e.g. the video player or the game (video player: mpv --vo=opengl --hwdec=vdpau game: Stardew Valley). As far as I remember I had DRI3 explicitly enabled in my xorg.conf without any problems before this package update.

I tried capturing the issue with my cell phone camera but was unsuccessful.

Reading the mailing list I noticed a few recent bug reports due to DRI3 but I did not find one complaining about tearing. Similar reports appear to be quite a bit older. I might have missed something though or somebody else participating in [1] might have reported it in the meantime.

The versions of the packages that might be relevant are:

xf86-video-ati 7.8.99.r16.gea30d856
linux 4.9.4
xorg-server 1.19.1
mesa 13.0.3
llvm 3.9.1

The Xorg.0.log glxinfo output and kernel log should be attached.

Thank you for your work on the graphics stack.

Current behavior:
Export creates a DIV TYPE=FOOTER which does not validate as HTML 4.01 transitional because type is not part of the standard.


Expected behavior:
Create validating HTML code. (Perhaps use CLASS if the content should be styled through CSS or TITLE if it is only needed for readability?)

Logically it also seems to be missing in the API dispatcher [1].

I assume Mesa should not claim to support OpenCL 1.2 via `CL_VERSION_1_2` if at least one of the OpenCL 1.2 functions is not implemented.

full dmesg output with the following extra options: i915.enable_psr=0x2 log_buf_len=10M drm.debug=0x1e

Hi

Since the update from Fedora 22 to 24 and the associated upgrade of the kernel to 4.6/4.7
the screen of my Acer Aspire V3-772G (Intel i7-4702MQ GTX760M) has started to flicker.
The flickering starts immediately when the user login screen appears.

The flickering does happen occasionally when moving the mouse or when having something visible on the screen that moves (e.g. a watch command that has its output changed regularly or a youtube movie..).

The flickering does not occur when passing i915.enable_psr=0 to the kernel.

System: Acer Aspire V3-772G: i7-4702MQ GTX760M (Optimus) no external display.

when saving an document containing multiple empty lines as RTF document the lines have a different font size after opening the document again

Steps to reproduce:
1. create new empty writer document with some text and some empty lines between them

3. save as RTF and close the document
4. open the saved RTF file

Current behavior:

dmesg drm-intel-nightly drm.debug=0x1e before suspend

When resuming my Dell XPS 15 9550 from a suspend the monitor won't turn on again. Tested all quirks available from pm-suspend it does not work.

It's not related to X11 it happens also if you suspend without starting X.

The machine also has an 960M nVIDIA card but the module is not loaded and the card is turned off with the help of the bbswitch module. Have tested with the nvidia driver loaded it makes no difference. No physical output on the laptop is wired to the nVIDIA card (tested with starting X with only nvidia loaded it shows no outputs available).

Tested both vanilla linux-kernel-4.7.0 and latest drm-intel-nightly (currently at 4ef516d46da2ae7091ef0b0b8d05f600d2e85ab8). Nothing seems to happen in dmesg with vanilla kernel but that was tested without drm.debug=0x1e log_buf_len=1M.

It also gets no error state after resuming from suspend:

# cat /sys/class/drm/card0/error

patch for xdg-utils

The latest commit 781023ef997bac433dbc258bd5cfdc1366f2ffa4 not only bumps the version but also adds a t letter breaking syntax. xdg-open uses bashism for years (introduced in commit ba265f969b9061d221915c2528122c44a85ad7c2) and it breaks multigroup desktop files actually (easily verified with Google Chrome sed shows an error because 'localised_name' var receives 3 lines and thus the sed command isn't terminated properly). One of the cases there is [*) and while it works in bash dash uses “[” as a meta-character. I've quoted it to make it work.",0,"0"

What seems to be happening is that dkp_client_get_device returns NULL for the device just removed because it doesn't exist in the hash table. This probably shouldn't make the client crash anyway.

I asked the reporter to monitor the system bus when inserting and removing his device. The interesting bits are summarized below and show that there is a DeviceAdded the first time the device is connected then a DeviceRemoved when it is disconnected but there is no DeviceAdded signal when the device is reconnected. When the device is removed for the second time the DeviceRemoved triggers the crash because the device does not exist in the hash table in the client.

signal sender=:1.813 -> dest=(null destination) serial=52 path=/org/freedesktop/DeviceKit/Power interface=org.freedesktop.DeviceKit.Power member=DeviceAdded
   string /org/freedesktop/DeviceKit/Power/devices/keyboard_5_2

   string /org/freedesktop/DeviceKit/Power/devices/keyboard_5_2

I also asked the reporter to run the daemon with --verbose to capture the output when he does this (attached). This shows that when the device is connected for the second time it is treated as a change event because it still appears in the device list. This is why there is no second DeviceAdded signal:

Greetings

I recently got a second display and have been experiencing reliable GPU lockups when starting full screen games on one of the displays. The steps to reproduce go as follows:

  1) Run gnome-shell 3.8.4 as your desktop interface (this is sufficient at least)
  2) Have a multi-monitor setup
  3) Start a full screen game that only appears on one monitor

The result is several lockups that are eventually freed and errors in dmesg and such. I believe that OpenGL acceleration of the desktop is a necessary prerequisite as this behavior doesn't occur in say fluxbox. But I've observed the behavior with multiple games some of which don't (I think) use OpenGL. At the least I've seen it with Awesomenauts (which may be using OpenGL) and Icewind Dale running in wine (which I would suspect isn't but I may be wrong).

This is definitely related to multi-monitors as well because if I disable one monitor in the gnome system settings the problem goes away. Also if the game does full screen by switching the monitors to mirror one another the problem will not occur (probably because that is equivalent to a single screen setup). I observed this with Battle for Wesnoth.

I had thought this was related to Bug 54226 but was informed that this was unrelated and should post a new bug.

I'll attach my Xorg.0.log dmesg and /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_error_state from after a lockup.

Relevant hardware/software is as follows:

  CPU/GPU: i7 4770/HD4600
  Motherboard: ASrock z87 extreme6
  
  arch linux kernel 3.10.10
  gnome-shell 3.8.4
  mesa 9.2.0
  xserver 1.14.2
  intel drivers 2.21.15

Let me know if you need any other information and I'll attempt to provide it.",1,"0"

"SHARED-MIME-INFO-13817","Raw AAC streams should not be audio/mp4","I've been told that *.aac files are currently reported as audio/mp4 mimetype this seems to related to the mpeg4 container (ISO Media QuickTime whatever you call it today) used widely by iTunes that does quite often contain AAC audio streams (but not limited to iTunes can generate ALAC streams in m4a container).

Raw AAC files with .aac extensions are not usually contained in MP4 format they are as the name suggests raw streams and should then not be reported as being in mp4 format.

There is no neat magic data to identify a file as a raw AAC stream xine-lib does use some content detection but it's not 100% safe and it often have false positives.

"DRI-33851","[KMS Evergreen bisected] Crash on modeset on HP dv6-3050eo laptop","Created attachment 42866
Hack that allows me to boot on recent kernels.

My HP Pavilion dv6-3050eo laptop does not boot anymore with 2.6.38-rc1 or 2.6.38-rc3 kernels. It freezes when doing modeset. It only boots without KMS. I bisected the problem to this commit:

commit 9ace9f7b168fef492f731ba60da5c76bc0776e6d
Author: Alex Deucher 
Date:   Thu Jan 6 21:19:26 2011 -0500

drm/radeon/kms: adjust default clock/vddc tracking for pm on DCE5


Partially reverting this patch allows me to boot with KMS on 2.6.38-rc3. I'm attaching a patch that fixes the problem for me and it also adds some printks.

Here are the results of those printks:

radeon_pm_init clock.default_sclk 10000
radeon_pm_init clock.default_mclk 15700
radeon_set_power_state sclk 10000
radeon_set_power_state clock.default_sclk 10000
radeon_set_power_state pm.default_sclk 900
radeon_set_power_state mclk 15700
radeon_set_power_state clock.default_mclk 15700
radeon_set_power_state pm.default_mclk 15701

I suppose that number 900 (9 MHz?) is causing the lockup but I couldn't figure out where it comes from. (And apparently radeon_pm_resume is never called so that part of the patch may be just noise.)

This laptop is equipped with Intel+Evergreen switchable graphics and there is
no BIOS option to turn off GPU switching. The attached patch allows me to boot
with 2.6.38-rc3 KMS enabled but if I start Xorg and Radeon GPU is active the
system seems to freeze again. (But this might be a different problem.) If Intel
GPU is active Xorg starts just fine.

With kernel 2.6.37 (-rc8?) modesettings works AND Xorg works with both Intel
and Radeon GPUs.

I suppose I also need to add that Linux Radeon 3D has never worked properly on
this laptop. 3D works only on Win 7. R600c can sometimes run glxgears if I'm
careful. R600g usually hard locks the computer right away. But again this
might be a different problem and I haven't been able to test this recently.",0,"0"

"WAYLAND-102385","Forced touchscreen input device remove action via udev does not trigger touch-ups appropriately","We have a system with two touchscreens connected and a modified Weston based on 1.11.1 release. Libinput is 1.4.3. The two touch devices are aggregated into a single wl_seat in Weston.

We need to be able to do touchscreen calibration on the fly by user request without restarting Weston and keep the existing calibration across reboots. As we do not have a protocol extension for touchscreen calibration there is a calibration script that clears the existing calibration  flushes the calibration in udev uses udev API for force-remove and re-add the touchscreen input device launches weston-calibrator refreshes the calibration matrix in udev and uses udev API for force-remove and re-add the touchscreen input device in question. This force-remove and re-add triggers Weston to re-read the calibration from udev. As only one touch device is force-removed at a time the wl_seat never loses the touch capability.

In our case the following process is enough to trigger this:
    
    1) Place finger on touchscreen
    2) Run udevadm trigger -c remove -s input --name-match=/dev/input/event7 (This being out touchscreen input device)
    3) Remove finger
    4) Run udevadm trigger -c add -s input --name-match=/dev/input/event7
    5) Note touchscreen is unresponsive

If there is a touch down on the touch device at the time of its forced removal Weston's DRM backend does not relay the required touch-up events to Weston core to update the touch-down counts. This leaves Weston core to believe there is a touch down which cannot be released anymore leading to essentially dead touchscreen.

Based on the IRC discussion with Peter Hutterer the issue of the missing touch-ups might be a race in libinput. Or not. This bug report is to figure out if there would be anything to fix in libinput or should Weston do something different.

Quoting Peter: if I can reproduce it with a delayed libinput_dispatch() then I'll fix it in libinput for sure because that's what we promise.

It was tested once that if one physically unplugs the touch device from USB while a finger is down then the touch-up came as it should.",4,"0"

"XORG-93539","XInput 2 NotifyPointer events are not sent to the pointer window","In the XInput 2 event dispatching code we propagate focus out events starting from the child's parent up to (but excluding) the ancestor window (see DeviceFocusOutEvents). However NotifyPointer focus out events should also be sent to the window containing the pointer (the child itself) as performed by the core input event system.

This surfaced as a bug in Firefox/GTK3 that caused focus handing to fail due to a missing FocusOut (detail=NotifyPointer) event when focus was moved from PointerRoot to another toplevel after a window's destruction. As a GTK window's focus is changed when a NotifyPointer event occurs on a window this was causing the window to permanently retain focus (according to GTK at least). This does not occur on the core/non-xi2 backend which does send NotifyPointer focus out events to the pointer window.

The events that should occur when moving from PointerRoot to another window are detailed quite well here

"XORG-10296","[PATCH] Backward time adjustment or timestamp rewind may cause server lockup","The commit bb7a39ac13731a80fc2d80487f9da760dd34c3ba introduced this regression.

The execution of timer callbacks in CheckAllTimes may (and does e.g. with synaptics) result in the timers being rescheduled or new timers being set. The TimerSet function uses current now value though. Therefore subtracting the old new from the new timer's expires results in a higher value than delta + 250. As a result the function CheckAllTimers never gets out of the goto loop.

I'm attaching a proposed fix.",14,"0"
"POPPLER-31895","Poppler should't call abort() on error","Created attachment 40546
reproducer

Poppler calls abort() from OBJECT_TYPE_CHECK() and OBJECT_2TYPES_CHECK() if it doesn't get correct type.
The attached PDF makes poppler to crash because there are wrong values in BBox on line 3721. These values are stored as objError but getNum() expects objInt or objReal.
Simple fix could be change of these abort() to exit() (but still not optimal).

"LIBREOFFICE-38316","Hindi Devanagari characters in some fonts with psts encoding are not right","Quick report: I created a unicode compliant hindi font but it renders incorrectly only in libreoffice and openoffice.

The bug:
1. Some hindi characters in words are not rendered properly whereas the same words are properly rendered in QT4 and GTK applications

2. Please see the bug in video action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9f3CrsNjA

How to reproduce:
3. Download Nithyananda Font which has psts entries for िं र् x ि र् x िं (where x is a devanagari consonanat like क प च)
http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Nithyananda+Hindi+Unicode+Font+%28GPL%29?content=142684

Expected Behavior:
3. Should render text as in qt4 or gtk apps.




Additional information:

Most hindi or devanagari fonts e.g. mangal.ttf or arialunicode.ttf etc. do not have complete opentype font substitution table they use anchors to get these characters without the substitution lookup code. the 3 characters/glyphs are:

िं (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign anusvara/bindu) (किं जिं दिं रिं)
र्ि (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign R halant) (र्कि र्जि र्दि र्रि)
र्िं (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign R halant + bindu) (र्किं र्जिं र्दिं र्रिं)

and Fonts which has the code for the above 3 combinations the bug triggers else most common hindi/devanagari fonts do not have the substitution code.
the Fonts which has the code:

http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Nithyananda+Hindi+Unicode+Font+%28GPL%29?content=142684
http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/GISTYogeshN.htm

It seems to me that Libreoffice 3.4 and Openoffice 3.x do not use the code of post base substitution correctly whereas QT and GTK based applications like kwrite and gedit display the above 3 glyphs properly.


Please see a video (3 minutes) of the bug where kwrite gedit and libreoffice writer is shown by typing a few words.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9f3CrsNjA


typing or copy pasting the words in libreoffice also causes the bug:

(please notice if a character starts with ि(small i) followed by 2 consonants then a ं (bindu) र्+character (R Halant + character) र्(character)ं (R Halant+consonant+Bindu) then only the bug is visible)

Zip archive with 4 files for the decribed testing scenario

In the case a CALC document consists of a huge number of cells which contain sheetwise cross-linked cell functions LibO's runtime seems to escalate and leads to extremely slow performance and/or freezing/blocking of the GUI for many seconds or minutes.
The effect concerns LOADING DOC RECALCULATING on cell change event and SAVING DOC.
It looks in such a way as if at any time ALL cells are computed instead of recalculating/refreshing only the changed and depending cells.

It also slightly remembers old BUG 40650 but directly 43804 and 47106. 

The given example will IMHO reproduce the effects.
Test conditions of the following benchmark data:
OS:  Windows Xp Pro SP3
CPU: Intel Core i5-2410M 2.30 GHz
RAM: 3 GB
COMPARED APPLICATIONS: OpenOffice 3.3.0 Excel97 and LibO.

Effects reproduced with LibO 3.4.3 3.4.5 3.5.0RC3 LOdev3.5.2RC-nightlyBuild20120312 on WindowsXpSP3

Test:
Step 1: download zip and extract files
Step 2: try File 1 with OpenOffice
Step 3: extract File 2 and try xls with Excel97 or OpenOffice
Step 4: open File 1 with LibO

RoleWidget::create contains:

But streamWidget is defined as following in the glade file:


Where as RoleWidget is derived from [Minimal]StreamWidget which is derived
from Gtk::VBox so this is clearly wrong.

Adding:
printf(rolewidget type: %s\n g_type_name(G_TYPE_FROM_INSTANCE(w->gobj())))
for debugging shows that this really leads to RoleWidget being instantiated
as an EventBox (yet things still work due to sheer luck).

Notably when playing minetest normally this doesn't always happen but when it does the screen gets a light covering of graphical corruption confetti (photos to follow - had to be taken on a phone sorry).
Currently running a mesa debug build compiled from git at commit b0626c1f306 after seeing if https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105251 had anything to do with it - I think this is related but not entirely a duplicate as a fix mentioned there did stop the test program there from having an effect but did not stop this problem.

In the course of trying to reproduce this problem in a more repeatable manner I decided to take an apitrace (will attach in following messages). Interestingly the brief trace I took did not crash my system during recording of it but now replaying it will fairly regularly cause the same kind of lockup more frequently than the game itself will.
I ran apitrace replay in verbose mode to see whereabouts it stopped to see if this gave an approximate indications of where things starting going pear shaped.  The point at which output ends is well short of the entire apitrace dump as expected from what I saw - and additionally the stderr appears to contain an exception of some kind. See the apitrace.out.txt and apitrace.err.txt attachments (to follow separately).

I haven't yet got a dmesg output during minetest running itself but I have got some runs (spanning from boot to either hard or soft reboot - sometimes xorg was killable othertimes not) from replaying the offending api trace. These will also be attached in follow-up messages.
These appear to have a lot more GPU faults before the messages about timeouts appear.",12,"0"

There seems to be a few different problems

a) in fcxml.c when we pop off FcPopValue it looks to me that we should call
FcValueDestroy on the returned value
b) in fcpat.c when we check to see if a string can be deleted we check to see if
the string is hashed and if it is in the hash then not delete it but when a
string gets hashed a copy is taken of it so the original string becomes
undeletable afterwards. Presumably the intention is to see if the string to be
deleted actually belongs to the hashtable and not delete it in that case
c) in fcxml.c we push a FcVStackPushPattern(parse FcPatternFreeze(pattern)) a
frozen pattern has a ref of -1 and can't be deleted normally with
FcPatternDestroy. I'm unsure of what the proper course of action here is.

With 1.10.0 the build now fails in cairo-xlib-surface.c.  The Solaris Xlib is apparently missing XLinearGradient:

I'll be happy to provide more information if needed.  I'm just wondering if the requirement for Xlib was intentionally increased or if this was more of an accident?",82,"0"

Bug description:

Blank screen on the first intel DDX run right after running FBDEV DDX.
Not even possible to alternate to fbcon. Have to reboot or restart X to get screen back.

This behaviour breaks SuSE installation.

System environment:
-- chipset: Haswell

-- Display connector: DP

Reproducing steps:

- Run Intel ddx and stop it.
- Run FBDEV ddx and stop it.
- Run Intel ddx again.

multiple properties of the same name in different GInterfaces implemented by the same GObject

Currently if you have the same property name in two D-Bus interfaces and you implement both of those interfaces with the same GObject you have to make sure the names don't conflict.  This leads to inconsistent D-Bus interface property names.

Instead allow the GInterfaces to redirect the property request to another property name so you can fake the behavior.",6,"0"

"XORG-20118","xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball doesn't build on Debian lenny","Hi all --

I have a Sony Vaio PCG-R505ECX with the Intel 82830 CGC video system which I have recently upgraded to Debian lenny and was having some strange video corruption issues.

As a sanity check on the hardware I wanted to try a different video driver for the same chipset and soon found my way to the driver at http://www.intellinuxgraphics.com whose latest stable release is the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0.tar.bz2 download.

This file would initially not configure due to a requirement for libdrm version 2.4.4 but the same page provides the tarball for this version of the library and it built fine on my system using ./configure --prefix=/usr/local make make install.

Subsequent to this the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball would then configure but it would not build.  The makefile gets an error attempting to build i830_lvds.c.  The error starting from the build line for the problem file is:

  Debian lenny has version 7.1 of the X.org server and provides the associated header files and so forth in a -dev package.

  Is this just too old of an X.org installation to build this driver?  If so can you point me to an older version of the driver?  The chipset in question is rather old so I don't imagine there's a real requirement for new software but I was unable to find any archives of previous xf86-video-intel tarballs which might work.",4,"0"

Attachment when working

Hardware setup:
  ASUS P5K-VM
    ICH9
   82G33/G31 Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
   DVI plug in card

In 2.6.32 the system works reliably with or without the plug in card providing dual channel

In 2.6.35 X fails. Interestingly (this is Fedora 14) you get the graphical bootup display just fine but not the X after it

Just pre 2.6.38-rc1 it oopses but the oops seems fixed

In 2.6.38-rc1 it's even worse and you don't get that either in fact the moment KMS triggers it goes to pot

I've tested both the failing case with our without dual monitors with or without monitors plugged in and from cold or warm boot. The behaviour is somewhat erratic - different kinds of fail etc.

Bisecting doesn't seem to help - it just produces a series of kernels that don't boot or fail due to other problems - seems the bisect distance is just too great to be useful.

It's not the userspace that makes the difference - FC14 X was used in all cases.

The box produces mtrr warnings but removing those by cutting down RAM etc don't change the behaviour",0,"0"

After the patchwork integration to wayland and weston repositories the bot seems to no longer announce commits.

I suspect something got lost in the git hooks. We would like to have the bot working again.

"LIBREOFFICE-70232","footer affected by header left/right sharing in UI and ODF/DOCX formats","Created attachment 87240
ODT describing and exhibiting the problem.  LO4.0.4.2 properly sees two different footers but 4.1.1.2+ sees the odd page footer for both pages.

If you create a footer with different content for left and right pages upon re-opening the document the odd page footer is seen on both pages.  I think the problem might be related to the header settings since changing those will also affect the footer.

Simplest steps to reproduce:  create a two page document with a footer.  Format the footer and turn off Same content left/right and create two different footers. Save document as .odt or .docx.  When you open it again you will see the same (odd page) footer on all pages.

Workarounds: 
1.) also create a header that also turns off same content left/right
2.) save as .doc format
3.) in certain instances setting page properties - Page tab - Page layout: mirrored (instead of the default Right and Left) has helped - but not always.  It doesn't seem to work once the problem has already been seen.


Changing the header settings will affect the footer.   For example so far the header has been disabled.  If you enable the header (but leave same content left/right enabled) then you will immediately see that the even footer is replaced by the odd footer.  Turning off the header will similarly remove the even footer.


I'm not sure when this bug was introduced but it does not exist in 4.0.4.2.  It existed in 4.1.1.2 and still exists in 4.1.2.3. A very similar bug is https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69635. I mentioned this problem as a comment already in a somewhat similar bug 68418 but I'm creating this new bug report since the details are different and that report is targeting the next release instead of being a regression.  I'm marking this as somewhat important since it affects documents created with the default settings (Page format: left and right pages).",303,"1"

    llvmpipe: make the front-face behavior match the gallium spec
    
    The spec says that front-face is true if the value is >0 and false
    if it's <0. To make sure that we follow the spec lets just
    subtract 0.5 from our value (llvmpipe did 1 for frontface and 0
    otherwise) which will get us a positive num for frontface and
    negative for backface.

"LIBREOFFICE-83955","TRACK CHANGES: Customizing the changes toolbar","Created attachment 106396
modified changes.xml

As a continuation of the work joel made in bug 47677 I would like to further improve on the changes toolbar. Below are the steps i took in order to achieve the final customization results.

Step 1: Addition of missing buttons
-----------------------------------
Two very important buttons were missing from the toolbar - Next Change (.uno:NextTrackedChange) and Previous Change (.uno:PreviousTrackedChange) - and Zeki suggested the addition of Compare Document (.uno:CompareDocuments) and Merge Document (.uno:MergeDocuments).

Step 2: Hiding of confusing buttons
-----------------------------------
There are two buttons labeled comment - one is a track change comment (.uno:CommentChangeTracking) and the second is the standard comment (.uno:InsertAnnotation). As the toolbar is for track changes the standard comment should be hidden in this toolbar to eliminate confusion (also the standard comment will likely be coming to the standard toolbar - bug 83118).

Step 3: Set toolbar to 'Icons & Text'
-----------------------------------
A combination of icons and short labels are useful for this few entry floating toolbar. Possibly when new unique icons can be create for these buttons maybe the labels wont be as important.

Step 4: Shortening text names
-----------------------------------
Here are single word text labels for the various multi word buttons

Protect - .uno:ProtectTraceChangeMode
Previous - .uno:PreviousTrackedChange
Next - .uno:NextTrackedChange
Accept - .uno:AcceptTracedChange
Reject - .uno:RejectTracedChange
Dialog - .uno:AcceptTrackedChanges
Compare - .uno:CompareDocuments
Merge - .uno:MergeDocuments

Step 5: Addition of uno icons
-----------------------------------
Until there are custom created buttons for these icons here are useful icons i was able to get from the current uno icon set

.uno:ShowTrackedChanges - .uno:AddWatch
.uno:TrackChanges - .uno:RecSave
.uno:PreviousTrackedChange - .uno:ScrollToPrevious
.uno:NextTrackedChange - .uno:ScrollToNext
.uno:AcceptTracedChange - .uno:ZoomPlus
.uno:RejectTracedChange - .uno:ZoomMinus
.uno:ProtectTraceChangeMode - .uno:ChainFrames
.uno:CommentChangeTracking - .uno:EditDoc
.uno:AcceptTrackedChanges - .uno:InsertObjectFloatingFrame

-----------------------------------

I've included in the attached file my modified xml toolbar file as the buttons were reorganized to better suit the new buttons added. Compare and Merge Documents were left as hidden by default for users to enable if they so wish.",7,"0"

It appears that something flashes on the dialog before it goes away but this
happens too fast for me to read.


This should probably fail with a usage message since this case does not match
the documentation. It could also be fixed so that the -c is optional (much like
sudo).

3. Go to cell B3 and insert a comment = C1 and then go to cell B4 and insert a comment = C2
4. Select the second row (on the row name 2 on the left) and make a right mouse click and select INSERT ROWS ABOVE to insert a row

Interim Result: 
A row is inserted and the cells and comments are moved down correctly but if you move the mouse over the cells to show the comments single blue lines from the comment box remain (they disappear when scrolling up and down).

5. Now press the keys CTRL + Z to undo the insertion of the row

Result: The inserted row is deleted but the comments are moved up one more row (to cell B2 and B3).

The build ran smoothly until:

There are a few replacements for vasprintf out there which could probably be used. How does libspectre prefer to handle platform-specific stuff?",141,"0"
"XORG-98811","iceauth segfaults on invalid input","Created attachment 128106
My proposed patch

The 'add' command leads to a segmentation fault on invalid input.

Two arguments to 'add' can be quoted but the quotation check does not
properly parse a single double quote:

$ echo 'add 0  0 0 0' | iceauth
Segmentation fault
$ _

This happens because the code does not properly check if the argument
consists of just one quote. Technically it is true that the first
and the last characters are double quotes. Therefore it also takes a
check to verify that the length of the string is at least 2.",489,"1"

The new intel driver likes to report errors in the hardware state after

Using Xv just makes it happen faster and completely disables the output
(no log currently). Without Xv the effects includes
- glyphs are replaced by rectangles
- background image looks like memory corruption and
- wrong colors.

This is using a PAE kernel which means no GEM.  I understand this is a compat path but it seems there's some issue when using the fake bufmgr and the effects seem quite bad.  I asked Bastian to try NoAccel will report back.",80,"0"

"SYSTEMD-90788","systemd-nspawn: return key does not work in some programs","I have a container with a user set up to run the fish shell.

machinectl login container does give me a login prompt and starts fish. Unfortunately the return key does not do anything in that setup but Ctrl-J does work to trigger commands.

Changing the shell to bash helps somewhat: That shell recognizes the return key as expected. Starting fish from bash does end up with a broken return key again. A bash started from fish does work.

Other programs are effected as well: Sudo won't accept the return key in the password prompt git has similar problems whenever asking something and I am sure other programs display similar problems. Ctrl-J works in all places I ran into.

When I use nsenter  --mount --uts --ipc --net fish as well as sudo and git work as expected.

Any ideas?

This is stty -a inside the nspawn-container:

-echoprt -echoctl echoke

The difference is AFAICT:
eol eol2 -icrnl -ixany -imaxbel iutf8 -iexten -echoctl

stty -F /dev/ptmx is identical inside and outside of the container --
but I am not sure whether that is what you were asking in the second
part of your reply.

I tried running stty eol ^J -F /dev/pts/0 inside the container and
got a SIGSEGV. It works outside the container.",374,"1"
