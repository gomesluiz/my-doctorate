terminal output

I tested with the trial version of Age of Mythology as I don't have the full version so can't say whether or not the full version of the game is affected.

The problem: performance is considerably slower in the game since Wine 1.5.7. This can be observed during the cutscenes in unit animations or when scrolling the screen.

According to my testing the problem appeared in 1.5.7 and is still present as of wine-1.5.9-186-g1f6febe. The result of the regression test:

Steps to reproduce the problem with the trial version:
1. download and install the demo (installing msxml4 is not mandatory with current Wine)
2. start the demo with aom.exe. Background animation in the menu is kinda slow. Click on   : a prologue video begins to play and you can observe how slow the rendering is. You can observe the same laggy performance during gameplay too.

Call of duty 4 with 3D Mark patch only (+d3d trace)

After applying the 3D Mark patch (see bug 9210) the game will start to load and crash before entering the menu.

In 1.0 rc3 I was possible to ear sound while having a black screen or a message box displaying :
DirectX encountered an unrecoverable error.
Check the readme for possible solutions. 

With 1.0 rc4 the game just segfault right after the splash screen.

I have an nvidia geforce 9600gt with the driver 173.14.05 and is performing well with other 3D games in wine.

I made some test changing the offscreen rendering method and the video memory size without any change in the result.

I'm attaching a trace with +d3d with the 3D Mark patch only and another one with applying also the NVidia patch.

conclusion

Under Wine using CreateDIBSection 
for a 160*160 4bpp(16color) will result in a 16bpp
(65536color) bitmap creation wich will mislead the following <a href 
= #cmd3>SetBitmapBits. So our conclusion is that something may go wrong 
with CreateDIBSection intepreation of <a href 
= #pfb>Wine.

testcase

Hi all

I tired to enable visual style[1] for dialog in shell32.dll and comdlg32.dll. Normally a dialog will be themed by visual style when comctl32.dll v6 and InitCommonControls() was used.
I implemented a dialog in a dll and used 'Activation Contexts'[2] to let the dll depend on comctl32.dll and call InitCommonControls() but when the dialog was called by another program the dialog didn't be themed.

testcase.tar.gz is testcase I wrote for reproducing this bug.
You can reproduce the bug follow:
1. Install and enable a visual style theme in winecfg
2. Download the testcase unarchive it and make
3. $ wine main.exe click the 'OK' button. You can see button in the main windows was themed but two buttons in the dialog was not themed. (as picture testcase_wine.png showing)

Expected result:
The dialog also is themed as picture testcase_windows.png showing.

The patch has been submitted. It makes sense (at least to me :-) and I tested
it with a bunch of apps too.

And yes the window insisting on being on top is a feature and separate from
this bug.

Screenshots and scarangel error file

Hello

I have been using ScarAngel v2.5 in Ubuntu 7.10 for months Ok (of course ScarAngel works also Ok in Windows XP) with previous version of Wine (I think it was Wine 0.9.54).

However in Kubuntu 8.04 with the 0.9.60 version of Wine ScarAngel
v2.5 always crashes (while starting). Not matter if I try to start it
from the NTFS Windows XP partition but also it crashes if I download 
this eMule mod to (and try to start it from) my home directory in Kubuntu.

Here I attach you 2 screenshots and also the error file made by ScarAngel.

Otherwise the eMule v0.48a works fine in Kubuntu 8.04 with the latest
version of Wine. Anyway I do prefer to use ScarAngel as it's better
the ScarAngel mod than the original eMule program.

Also I can't install previous versions of Wine in Kubuntu 8.04.

wineconsole in emacs mode crashes when pressing Ctrl + y (paste buffer) while the buffer is still empty.

In a fresh wineprefix:

cairo on win32 to see if it works -- it doesn't. The sample code is attached

If the path ends in a backslash Windows leaves it intact while WINE strips it

programs which rely on this undocumented feature being present (like Heroes of

with stuff like C:\progdirfilename looking filenames instead of
C:\progdir\filename. Those with the good wits of checking/adding backslashes
don't )

This bug applies to the Steam version of game as I can't reproduce the problem with the non-Steam demo available from the developer (Subsoap).

The crash occurs quite frequently but not always at the same point. Sometimes it happens on game start after the developer logo is shown but before the main menu could appear.
Another way to reproduce the crash is to click on one of the buttons in the main menu then go back to the title screen. The generated backtrace is always the same.

This happens with ALL investment accounts.  Also data seems to be all there because Quicken still shows correct amounts in sidebar.  You just can't go in the register and record more transactions however ONLY for investment account registers. All other accounts/registers work fine.

"WINE-12052","Flatout 2 dinput_test: crashes if joystick axis mapping is enabled different joystick sensitivity","because Wine currently maps joystick hat as axes (which makes playing IL2 really difficult) I've been trying to use axis mapping. However some applications crash on startup if axis mapping is enabled AND POV is mentioned somewhere.

I'm using Thrustmaster USB (2960623) joystick.
for jstest device information see jstest_info.txt.

Under wine device feels different: joystick seems to have different sensitivity and small unexpected deadzone (which doesn't exist on windows). 

Without axis mapping joystick seems to work mostly fine but joystick hat is being mapped as axes not as Point-of-view control. dinput_test works normally and reports 2 failrues (see dinput_test_normal.txt for log).

When I try to use following axis mapping (to make hat work in IL2):
XYZPOV1Rz dinput_test crashes on second test and hangs while printing backtrace. see dinput_test_crash.txt. For dinput and trace debug data see dinput_test_trace.txt (Aquired using WINEDEBUG+=tracedinput wine dinput_test.exe.so joystick)

With this mapping Flatout 2 crashes after intro movies.
see flatout_2_crash.txt

With this mapping IL2 works fine but doesn't recognize hat controls anyway.

With another mapping:
XYZPOV1
dinput_test crashes in the same way. 
see dinput_test_crash2.txt for details. It looks like crashes occur only when POV1 is included in axis mapping.",53,"0"

(One interesting note: A Find done not-whole-word will miss a second
version of the word in a row. Ex.: in blahblah only the first blah is
found while if RichEd20.dll is not loaded the Find is almost entirely
malfunctional. It's possible those issues are partially connected to
some problem with offset position numbers used to start the Find. In
both the control and API the RTB text has a zero-based offset system
but Wine could be starting text at 1?  )

I haven't been checking it in awhile but today I did then had to trace it back to 1.5.26.

After a bisect it came to commit gdiplus: GdipMeasureCharacterRanges should treat empty layout extents as infinite when StringFormatFlagsNoClip is specified..
Clipping went broken again resulting in invisible text.

Minimal fix attached and sent to wine-patches.

See initial post

Hi there

using FEAR 1.08 with DX8 shaders enabled (ingame option). Wine is patched to use the nvts fragment pipeline and not the ARBfp one (it crashes with ARBfp because of this bug: http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15858).

Hardware used: NV GFFX 5900
Drivers: 173.14.12

FEAR has a lot of visual errors so I found it best to start with obvious problem that show up on the console as WARNs ERRs or FIXMEs.

After loading a savegame and right before getting ingame I get some of these FIXMEs:
fixme:d3d:context_check_fbo_status FBO status GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DIMENSIONS_EXT (0x8cd9)
fixme:d3d:context_check_fbo_status 	Color attachment 0: (0x2a041cf0) WINED3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 512x512

fixme:d3d:IWineD3DDeviceImpl_ClearSurface >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION_EXT (0x506) from glClear @ device.c / 5129

I'm looking for some advice how to encircle the root of the problem. Adding Stefan Dösinger and Henri Verbeet to CC since they probably know how to debug this kind of thing.

List of visual errors I encounter:
- Random polygons popping up looking like shadow volume leftovers
- zbuffer-like precision issues
- lighting issues

Logfile is attached but AFAIK it doesn't contain anything useful besides the output I already pasted here.

"WINE-4920","Regression: winecfg and many other stuff broken (crash with an unhandled exception after a while)","The patch
http://source.winehq.org/git/?p=wine.gita=commith=9873494ced8405113381266b4d99c2a9f3002cb1
introduced weird behavior: all applications that are installed on my system 
are crashing after a while with an unhandled exception and with theming 
enabled some controls look weird and even contribute to the crashing. Here's 
an example backtrace for winecfg:

wine: Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x00000060 at address 0x60 
(thread 0009) starting debugger...
WineDbg starting on pid 0x8
Unhandled exception: page fault on read access to 0x00000060 in 32-bit code

I know that theming is broken and unsupported however applications crash also 
without theming and before this patch everything worked fine.

I hope that Alexandre Julliard will revert this patch as soon as possible 
because it is really critical since it breaks _every_ application including 
winecfg and regedit. I couldn't even use regedit because it crashed when I 
tried to edit a registry entry!",8,"0"

"WINE-20755","Minor display problems in Mafia","There are some minor display problems in Mafia. In particular at the very beginning of the demo when people are sitting around a table their eyeballs seem to pop out of their heads. This is probably due to the fact that Mafia uses a W-buffer while Wine handles it as a Z-buffer (this can be seen in dlls/wined3d/state.c).
Moreover I get this fixme message:
fixme:d3d:state_zenable W buffer is not well handled

Would it be a lot of work to add support for a W-buffer in Wine? (the WGL_EXT_depth_float OpenGL extension might be used)",1081,"1"

this is more an experts request but it should also help getting better diagnosis (logs) from users.

There are apps and games that crash when being relay traced because they employ intrusive API hooking schemes that can't cope with Wine's relay thunks.

The game dll calls 'WINMM.joyGetNumDevs'.

Original relay thunk emitted for that API:

--- snip ---
F6F38234   push    esp
F6F38235   push    1Dh
F6F38237   call    __wine_spec_get_pc_thunk_eax
F6F3823C   lea     eax [eax+35270h]  descriptor lookup

F6F38243   call    dword ptr [eax+4]
F6F38246   retn    0
--- snip --- 

The hook engine copies all opcodes that are potentially overwritten by the 5-byte long jump to an intermediate thunk.
Hence the call to '__wine_spec_get_pc_thunk_eax' is copied too - leading to the actual problem.

A long jump is written to the relay thunk entry which jumps to another trampoline located at the intermediate thunk area.

This obviously can't work because '__wine_spec_get_pc_thunk_eax' relies on being called from original relay thunk code.

Because Steam game overlay renderer hook engine relocated this essential part of relay thunk code the returned address will always be wrong.

You can fix this problem by padding the relay thunk entry with enough 'no-op' opcodes to not have '__wine_spec_get_pc_thunk_eax' relocated by hook engines.

The method works and AFAIK has no side-effects.
I used a patch in my repo for some time now to cope with such stubborn apps/games (mostly DRM related).

"WINE-40540","ReadIntervalTimeout is ignored if there is data in the buffer when ReadFile is called and no data arrives after that","Created attachment 54371
Copy of code where error occurs in Appload.exe

I am running on wine-1.9.8 (Staging).

Program is connected to a USB VCP serial device as COMnn. The behavior of overlapped reads is different between Windows and Wine.
A Serial write is sent to the device which triggers a response. The code below is waiting for the response. The response is 8 characters pretty much immediately.

Under Wine when I step with the VS2008 debugger remotely the ReadFile returns with IO_Pending and I see the eight characters in the read buffer. The call to WaitForSingleObject blocks until it times out returns TIMEOUT and the read process is considered failed.

Under Windows ReadFile also returns IO_Pending read buffer unmodified. The call to WaitForSingleObject returns Success. GetOverlappedResult succeeds with read length of 8. Life is good.

If I set dwToRead to 8 the code works correctly under Wine. When it is at 64 we have problems under Wine but not Windows.
ReadIntervalTimeout in COMMTIMEOUTS is 1000 so after one second without new characters the ReadFile should be considered complete and WaitForSingleObject should return. This appears not to be happening under Wine. Is this fixable under Wine?

Example code attached.

App is called Appload and is available here: https://wiki.opticonusa.com/techsupport/en/Appload

To run the app and demonstrate the issue you would need an Opticon barcode scanner or a mock up of a scanner on /dev/ttyACM0. App does an enumeration of COM devices so Wine needs registry mods as described here: http://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2013/03/getting-x-ctu-in-wine-to-detect-your-serial-ports/

I can likely provide whatever a credible developer needs if the example attached is not sufficient.",48,"0"
"WINE-348","using DGA with directx program crashes with X error BadColor","Running a directx app namely games specifically Fallout 2 and StarCraft with
DGA causes wine to abort apparently after displaying one frame (or possibly as
soon as the game attempts to change colors or pallete?) with an error such as:
         
X Error of failed request:  BadColor (invalid Colormap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  89 (X_StoreColors)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x160000d
  Serial number of failed request:  3700
  Current serial number in output stream:  3959

The same configuration works with wine 20010510 but not 20010824.
(These are packages I happened to still have around in my apt archives...)
In synchronous mode wine does not abort visuals and sound are OK but there's
no input the keyboard and mouse do nothing and one has to log in remotely to
kill wine.bin.

I couldn't find any bugs in the database with a similar description. If you need
more info please email me.

I tried to run Capella 2002 on Suse Linux 8.0 via wine.
Problem: at startup there's a welcome-screen popping up.
I can see the application-windows behind it but there's 
no way to get them in focus. (On windows the welcome-screen
disappears after a few seconds).

You can try it out for your self. There's a free demo available
at www.capella.de it's name is cap2002demo.exe.

"WINE-21422","winedbg cannot find local symbols in EXE.","While trying to debug:

http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21388 (test.exe - attachment #1).

i found this bug in winedbg. winedump finds all of the symbols but winedbg cannot do the same.

so: break __do_global_dtors cannot find the symbol.

I tried to debug winedbg/dbghelp.dll a bit to find the problem and found some hints (i am not sure if all of it is correct):

1) Module_get_container() does not return the correct module. It returns /lib/libc as the container for test.exe. This does not seem right.

If i hack myself around this i get to:

2) It would seem that winedbg/debughlp.dll only loads export symbols? As the EXE has no exports then no symbols are found.... is this right? What about all of the other symbols?

Furthermore if i force the debugger to break at the correct place the debugger seems to show the wrong disassembly. Not sure if that is the same bug or a different one.",165,"0"

Unfortunately ntdll's 32 bits relay_call clobbers ECX (=0) hence the exception after returning from KERNEL32.GetCurrentThreadId().

Preserving ECX in relay_call() lets the app successfully +relay traced (already tested).
Technically EDX might need to be preserved for callers too but this app can live without it...

"WINE-26417","Starcraft 2 - DirectX Mouse Capture broken (fullscreen and windowed)","When playing starcraft 2 mouse capture seems to be broken in both windowed and fullscreen mode. Mouse capture is important in SC2 because moving the mouse to the border scrolls the screen. This seems to stem from two separate problems. 

Windowed mode: Since SC2 gives you more relative viewing area when running in widescreen mode I tried running in a widescreen window in my fullscreen monitor. However I can't get the mouse to stay inside the screen while playing either with the default mouse capture setting or setting wine to emulate a virtual desktop and using fullscreen mode in SC2. 

Fullscreen mode: When using dual-head mode (Twinview on nvidia) and playing SC2 at the native resolution of one of my monitors the mouse doesn't stay on that monitor. It still jumps over to the other monitor whichever side it's attached to. This is annoying but not as bad as the first case since the mouse is captured on 3 sides.)

The mouse works fine when running in one monitor in fullscreen mode which is the only way to play at the moment.

To reproduce: run SC2 in windowed mode or in fullscreen mode with emulate virtual desktop or fullscreen mode with multiple monitors. Might be problem with the DirectInput emulation but I specified unknown since I'm not sure.",362,"0"

Symptom/Failure:

The Witcher 3 or Crysis 2 (see https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44146) in menus using 3.2 with new buffer patch from https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42592 when browsing the menu before launching the game (here: TW3) the FPS is capped at 60 even though Vsync is turned off in nvidia-settings and the game.

Interestingly the game seems similarly to be semi-stuck/capped at ~20 fps when running.

How to reproduce:

1) Build recent master or 3.2 with the following patch https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42592

2) Disable Vsync in e.g. nvidia-settings.

3) Launch the game

4) Observe FPS while in the first menu menu

What should happen:

Using wine-staging 2.21 or older FPS runs into the 100s when in the menu without Vsync.",23,"0"

1. I did a regression test between 1.3.17 and 1.3.18:

commit 6eed4c4241ae30f9e0af2581555c5ce6c25623f3
Author: Dmitry Timoshkov 
Date:   Tue Apr 5 18:31:27 2011 +0900

    winex11: Move the SendMessage(WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_MAXIMIZE/SC_RESTORE) call after the window extents check.

2. No other bug report suffers from this commit.

3. Revert of this patch on top of wine-1.3.22-203-gac90c1b makes that problem go away.

while the command is wrong it's still interesting!

P.S.
wineconsole has basicly the same results only that it opens a box to play with.

I do not get the error if I compile it in a 32-bit chroot.  When ignoring the

run fine.

I did some digging into configure.ac and found the cause of the warning:

Apparently the AC_CHECK_LIB call for FT_Init_FreeType is failing

As you can see:  Not only do I have FreeType2 (which seems to work fine
compiling every other app that needs it) I even upgraded from the latest CVS to
see if it corrected the problem.  It didn't.

I know almost nothing of autotools/autoconf.   Is this a bug in the 64-bit
AC_CHECK_LIB or could there something wrong with the parameters being passed to
it that would still work on 32-bit?

Here's how the output of freetype-config --cflags and --lib varies between my
32-bit chroot and my 64-bit environments:

32-bit:
------------
evil@pluto:~$ freetype-config --cflags
-I/usr/include/freetype2
evil@pluto:~$ freetype-config --libs
-lfreetype -lz

64-bit:
-----------
evil@pluto:~$ freetype-config --cflags
-I/usr/local/include/freetype2 -I/usr/local/include
evil@pluto:~$ freetype-config --libs
-L/usr/local/lib -Wl--rpath -Wl/usr/local/lib -lfreetype -lz

I'm wondering if all that extra stuff in the libs variable is messing with
AC_CHECK_LIB's results.  I tried to override the libraries myself but I have
another problem in that whenever I make changes to configure.ac and run
autoconf configure.ac > configure I get a lot of SED errors like this:

   ...
   config.status: creating dlls/ws2_32/tests/Makefile
   sed: file ./confstattYvqXN/subs-4.sed line 14: unterminated `s' command
   config.status: creating dlls/wsock32/Makefile
   sed: file ./confstattYvqXN/subs-4.sed line 14: unterminated `s' command
   ...

I'm guessing there's a parameter that I'm unaware of that I need to be using on
the autoconf command.

screenshot

Description: 
Riven is an adventure game originally released in 1997. In the game you can change locations by moving the mouse pointer to the edges of the screen and pressing LMB. The game offers 3 settings for screen transitions (fastest normal and best) they alter how smoothly the transitions take place.

The problem:
When I'm turning left or looking upwards the screen gets garbled (see attached screenshot). Interestingly transitions to other directions (right forwards downwards) work correctly.

No demo available.
Workaround: disable screen transitions in the option menu.

This feature worked in 1.3.28 but not in the current git (wine-1.3.28-308-gae80430):

wine 1.3.28 log (good)

Framemaker 6.0 has been working fine with wine for a long time. After updating my ubuntu distro to 12.04 (beta) it only prints blank pages. My tests summarizes as:

Wine 1.3.28 (Ubuntu 11.10): works fine
Wine 1.4 (Ubuntu 12.04): only prints blank pages
Wine 1.5.1 (Ubuntu 12.04 + wine-ppa): only prints blank pages (same result)

Same result in different machines (i386 and amd64) printing to postscript file or PDF (native or with cups-pdf driver).

The program have an option to print to a file. I have tested this by using Generic Postcript Driver included with the program and other printers installed. In either case the PS file is generated and seems to have correct headers and footers but lacks the content (so the blank page). I attach some examples.

notepad.exe prints correctly (I also attach a PS output).

Wine 1.4 and 1.5.1 generate exactly the same PS output. PS output from 1.3.28 has identical headers and footers but also includes the contents (so it works).

The program has an option to save as PDF that works fine in wine 1.3.28. But in 1.4 and 1.5.1 it gives a Internal errors - invalid parameters received in a window and only generates a .tps file (a PS pre-elaboration I guess).

Tooltip text is drastically cut off which is a big problem

------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2003-02-10 13:03 -------
This is being caused because this sequence of events is taking place. Early on
the app creates two DCs for the tooltip with a default size of 66x20 pixels. One
is an offscreen DC for working in (ends up being 0xa18 on my system) and the
other is the DC that is used to actually display the tooltip on the screen
(0xa14). When it comes time to show the tooltip the app moves and resizes both
DCs and paints and writes in the text to the offscreen DC. It then copies this
into the screen DC and sends a signal to make it visible. Up to this point
everything is fine. 

When the window is made visible some events are received from the X queue
which catch up the app. It sends two resize events to the offscreen DC the
first resizes back to 66x20 which effectively clips the rest of the tooltip
and the second resizes it back to the correct size. Unfortunately the contents
are now corrupted but the app is assuming the offscreen DC is ok. The corrupted
offscreen DC is then copied to the screen DC. 

When the tooltip is hidden and redisplayed the same sequence of events occurs.
Except this time the DCs were already at the correct size for the tooltip so
no resizing back to 66x20 occurs and the offscreen DC is not corrupted this
time. Even when the window is closed and reopened it continues to use the DCs
it has already created so no problem occurs.


------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2003-02-10 15:48 -------
And it looks like this patch fixes this bug. I am not real sure why this code is
here so will have to study more before submitting. And there are already lots
of patches setting in the queue already :-) 

An X ConfigureNotify event is a notification that a window has just been
changed. So it is not clear to me why Wine immediately then changes it again. I
will have to test with a bunch of apps to see if I can figure out what (if
anything) it is needed for.

Watch out for word wrap.

I didn't try your first fix but the second works!!  This is great for Visual 
FoxPro and Wine... 
 
One thing though not sure if this should be a separate bug report or not. If 
I display some ToolTipText and then switch to a different application the 
ToolTipText will be displaying on top of the foreground app's windows as well. 
Actually the ToolTipText will be on every desktop workspace on top of all 
other windows. I had previously noticed this phenomenon for dockable windows 
that were currently undocked in the VFP IDE so I'm assuming this is a 
separate issue entirely and will likely file a separate bug report in a couple 
weeks...

console log

The Void is an adventure game developed by Ice-Pick Lodge (Russian title: Turgor).

Both music and speech (voices) are stuttering/skipping heavily in the game on my system. Cutscenes are not affected (they're playing audio correctly).

The problem can be observed right away in the main menu: the background music is skipping so frequently that only every other second of the music can be heard.
The same happens during dialogues in the game: in a spoken sentence only every other word can be heard the rest is skipped (it's very annoying I must say).

Workaround: using ALSA with emulation mode (music/voices are playing correctly).

No such problem when using OSS.

"WINE-11607","Blood 2: The Chosen keyboard repeat problem","Hi there

I'm filing another Blood 2 bug. This one is input related more precisely about keyboard input. I know that the Blood 2 informations on the net mentioned the support for DirectInput devices but I'm not sure this is a dinput bug. So I'm leaving this to unknown for now.

To the problem:
I installed Blood 2 through wine and did no patching (version is still 1.0). Also the copy protection was not removed the executable should be clean.

Starting the game and entering the configuration menu I noticed it was very hard to setup the keys I wanted to use in the game (like moving forward backward etc.)

When running Blood 2 natively you select a action in the menu you want to map. You press ENTER and the game engine waits for you to press another key which it uses for mapping.

Now when running wine I had to be REALLY quick when pressing the mapkey. Like some milliseconds later it was really no fun to config the game. When I wasn't quick enough for an action the ENTER key itself is mapped.

Now the interesting part. When not releasing the ENTER key after pressing it and then pressing the mapkey the process works.

I suspect that the ENTER key generates two events for the game. Pressing and releasing and the game interprets both events as seperate key presses so ENTER gots mapped to everything (because the engine thinks it's pressed twice).

So either this is X related or a bug in the wine's keyb implementation.

Thanks

Mouse positioning within text is not possible as the cursor will not go beyond the first inch of the left margin of the text input field no matter where I click within the viewable text field.

I have attached a .gz file with the following snapshots
wine-snapshot1.png - shows the program operating normally using wine 1.1.15
wine-snapshot2.png - shows the program during text edit using wine 1.1.24. Note the input field is unreadable in the Description column.
wine-snapshot2.png - As above but have tabbed the cursor to the Quantity field the text I typed appears but if I try to re-edit it by clicking my mouse anywhere in the text the mouse cursor sits in the middle if the word rendition and the text input field is unreadable again.

I have edited snapshot3 to draw attention to the icon text as well which you will see is the same in snapshot2 but no problem in snapshot1.

I did save a terminal output file of the complete wine cshbk502d.exe install process followed by winetricks dcom98 as is required to get this program working but I copied the wrong text files to my LAN and am unable to recreate them for time restraints. If you need them I will repeat the process through vbox and attach them.

1. Install the demo as usual.
2. Launch the game with ../Bin/ClonesGame.exe. You will receive an immediate crash in quartz/filtergraph.c as can be seen in the attached log.

Download the demo version from http://download.cnet.com/Phantasy-Star-Online-demo/3000-7539_4-10243432.html

Bug 1: The game runs in fullscreen mode but the Ubuntu menu bar and task bar hide a bit of the game display.

Bug 2: If several programs are running it is typically possible to switch between them by pressing Alt-TAB -- but the game won't show up! I only see the other programs I'm running.

Bug 3: The game changes my screen resolution from 1366x768 to 640x480. If I start the game press enter at the title screen and then exit my screen's resolution changes back to 1366x768 when I'm exiting the game.

Now try another thing: start the game press enter at the title screen and then new game. The stage will load. Now press the escape key and then exit (ゲーム終了 if you're using the default Japanese language setting). You should now be back at the title screen. Now you can repeat: enter and then exit. This time the screen resolution *doesn't* change back to 1366x768 and it is necessary to manually go to the display settings to fix the resolution.

Bug 4: If I Alt-TAB to another program the game still hides that program unless I'm also changing workspace.

Bug 5: The game is a 4:3 game but the image is stretched out on my 16:9 display. When using the same hardware but rebooting into Windows 7 I get a 4:3 image with black bars on the left and right sides. Thus Wine and Windows behave differently. Maybe this is because of a setting I'm not sure.

None of these bugs applies if I'm using the emulate a desktop setting in Wine's configurations. They only apply if this setting is unchecked.

When launching the game there is first a dialogue box with settings for fonts and other things. The bugs don't apply to this dialogue box. Press the button in the dialogue box and the game will start and then the bugs will apply.",351,"0"

"WINE-17666","WinARM make crashes","Due to some mysterious problem with ARM GCC mismatch in the FP settings that
nobody never specified I cannot use Linux native arm-elf-gcc.

I found that the WinARM version works under Windows and therefore
as almost the last resort (the last one is to use Windows)
tried to compile under Wine. It failed.

The error message looks as:
make: Interrupt/Exception caught (code = 0xc0000005 addr = 0xf7d3f54a)

Importance: Wine was the last workaround I could think out
I will switch to Windows for development.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Get WinARM-20060606. It is available in a number of places google gives:
http://winarm.alexthegeek.com/WinARM-20060606.zip
http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/WinARM-20060606.zip
Unpack it as C:\WinARM.

2. Get the project: go to olimex.com and find the STR-H711 board page
get the OpenOCD-projects100.zip archive with the projects.
http://www.olimex.com/dev/str-h711.html
http://www.olimex.com/dev/soft/arm/OpenOCD-projects100.zip

It includes a number of projects we need str_711 from it.
Unpack it as C:\workarm\str_711.

3. Run the tools.

3a)
wineconsole cmd

3b)
Z:\home\mg>set path=C:\WinARM\binC:\WinARM\utils\bin%path%
Z:\home\mg>path
PATH=C:\WinARM\binC:\WinARM\utils\binC:\windows\system32C:\windows

3c)
Z:\home\mg>c:
C:\>cd workarm/str_711
C:\workarm\str_711>

Now you can run `make clean` or manually clean it and run `make`

3d)
C:\workarm\str_711>make clean

"WINE-20053","Team-Fortress 2 and other source games suffer from black menu and missing UI textures in dx9 mode","When starting TF2 in directx9 mode (that is starting it normally out of the box) the menu is black (no background image) and there are no HUD elements in game. Other than this it appears to work fine and looks great in Dx9 mode and would be platinum status if you could see your UI.

Disabling pixelshaders in winecfg causes the game to load with a visible background on the main menu but the game immediately bails telling you your graphics card is not able to run the game.

-dxlevel 81 forces the game into dx8 mode where everything works but this is a major visual quality regression.",923,"1"

"WINE-30313","Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 Trial requires ISAXXMLReader feature namespace-prefixes","Hello

Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 Trial fails due to missing support for  ISAXXMLReader feature namespace-prefixes

Prerequisite:

Set WinVer to >= Windows Vista for installation due to MSXML6 (SP1) requirement.

Running the app after installation exhibits an error message about trial being already expired (most likely time bombed).
Just add any 23-digit number as product key to prevent this e.g.:

(one liner):

"WINE-7430","Wall Street Advisor 1.27 won't start / Windows Script Control install problem?","http://koolestone.blogspot.com/2007/02/linux-rocks.html
mentions that this app doesn't work on wine so I gave it a shot.

With wine from git as of 6 Feb:

Running 
$ wine Wall\ Street\ Analyzer.exe 
yields the suspcious looking error
  err:ole:get_inproc_class_object couldn't load in-process dll
LC:\\windows\\temp\\IXP000.TMP\\'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Windows
Script\\Windows Script Control'\\msscript.ocx
err:ole:create_server class {0e59f1d5-1fbe-11d0-8ff2-00a0d10038bc} not registered

The app seems to want mfc42 and wsh installed so
I installed those first and while it reduced warnings
in the installer it doesn't prevent the problem.

grep ocx ~/.wine/*.reg shows lines like
@=C:\\windows\\temp\\IXP000.TMP\\'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Windows
Script\\Windows Script Control'\\msscript.ocx

The file msscript.ocx does not seem to be installed even though
the installer ran the subinstaller for Windows Script Control
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d7e31492-2595-49e6-8c02-1426fec693ac&DisplayLang=en

So that subinstaller seems to both fail to install the control
and puts the wrong path into the registry.

I was hunting around for small windows programs to display bitmaps via GDI so that I could test the bitmap display code in Wine (to follow an afterthought I had relating to bug 14868). Since I wasn't able to find anything I decided to write my own (attached) then run it through Jason Summers' bitmap test suite (http://entropymine.com/jason/bmpsuite/reference/reference.html).

pro1.c - simple source that demonstrates the AllocConsole problem

MSDN library includes sample code for console applications
(http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa263818.aspx). The source is
available at: http://www.helsinki.fi/~sund/console_vs6.zip . The source
compiles easily with winelib after --cuiexe transformations with winemaker.

The first example is about freeing and allocating a new console. These
are basic operations that each reasonable console application should
perform.

The problem with wine is that input and output for console are disabled
after a (second) call to AllocConsole. That makes most interactive
console applications unusable.

The problem can be replicated by running the sample code application
with wineconsole and by selecting the first example from the list.

To make even easier replication possible I have attached a simple
source that demonstrates the problem (works smoothly in Windows).
I used the following commands to compile the attached source:

err:d3d:IWineD3DImpl_CheckDeviceType unsupported format WINED3DFMT_X8R8G8B8

Having looked at the function in dlls/wined3d/directx.c I noticed something a bit strange.

The function contains a line of code that reads:


for (it = 0 it < nCfgs ++i)

The function above it contains a very similar line which seems to be doing the same check.

for (it = 0 it < Adapters[Adapter].nCfgs ++i)

I added the Adapters[Adapter] part to the function where the error was occuring and can now switch to windowed mode without getting an error message.

I installed Altap Salamander 3.04 x64 in LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 and did not apply my registration keys to reproduce a normal testing environment.

  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 wine ~/Downloads/as304x64.exe

I ran it normally and encountered a crash please see below for the basic output.

  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Altap\ Salamander/salamand.exe

Then I added WINEDEBUG=+relay to the command and produced a trace where AS' own crash reported kicks in. I deleted it for the second trace.

  rm ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Altap\ Salamander/utils/salmon.exe

I will send the traces separately. They are not immediately needed but they might serve as a future reference as I think Altap Salamander only started cleaning the environment recently. I have not been able (unlike Wylda!?) to run Salamander for a very long time and I _really_ miss it.

For future debugging I am ready to participate on IRC. I also have a Git version installed if a good soul creates a function stub :-)

    wined3d: Try to avoid redundant constant updates.
    
    This gives a minor performance improvement. For example in 3DMark03 Game Test
    1 this gives about a 4% improvement in the Counter Strike: Source stress test
    it's about 1%. (NVIDIA GF9600M Intel T9550 1024x768).

It seems the app wants only version information but additionally passes langlen by reference (.NET code).
Both verlen and langlen ref values get set by MsiGetFileVersion() during first call.
verlen is properly increased by app (NULL terminator) but langlen ref value is ignored by app -> passed again unmodified at second call.
Wine returns ERROR_MORE_DATA because it thinks the app also wants language information passing insufficient langlen leading to app failure.

Game installs fine from the CDs but needs a NO-CD crack to circumvent the copy protection it has.

Various d3d7 errors are displayed on the shell (reported in the attachment) but they are not blocking the menu from displaying and working correctly.
As soon as I choose to start a multiplayer game or a skirmish the game shows a screen for a bunch of seconds then crashes to desktop.
If I choose to start a new campaign I can select which campaign to start (there are 3: Rimtech Milagro and Neuropa) but after this the game crashes to desktop because of an unhandled exception (as you can see in the log attached).

gets loaded (if one is to believe the Output window in VS).  If no frq.dll

"WINE-17195","Multiple applications and games need support for named pipe message mode (NamedPipe datagrams need to be _really_ datagrams)","ok after a little bit of investigation i think i understand the pipes code enough to be able to say what's going on and i'm seeing something like this:

process 1:

recvpipe = CreateNamedPipe(\\pipe\fred)
ReadFile(recvpipe buffer 
printf(length) ===> 43
ReadPipe(recvpipe buffer  /* no data */

process 2:

sendpipe = CreateNamedPipe(\\pipe\fred)
length = 9
WriteFile(sendpipe buffer 
length = 34
WriteFile(sendpipe buffer 


what's happening is that the data being sent down the pipes isn't being done as datagrams.  the implementation is using a stream-based fd.

the solution is: you _must_ implement a protocol on top of the pipes which sends the length (as a 32-bit int whatever) which is read off the fd followed by the data stream of _exactly_ that length.

_must_.  there's no two ways about this.

the protocol of Pipes is unfortunately a combination of both datagrams and streams.  datagrams because the lengths of data sent are absolute and inviolate.  streams because the data order and reliability are _also_ absolute and inviolate.

you can't use datagrams (because they're unreliable).  you can't expect all unixen to support datagrams on top of unix sockets (if that's what's being used).

so - you have to send the length as part of the implementation of the pipe-data-send.

sending a length will also solve the issue of trying to send zero-length pipe datagrams.

as a first implementation you _might_ be able to get away with assuming that when someone asks for some data they _will_ provide a buffer big enough.

Back again!
I think I found an importent information!
I installed HalfLife again! Perheaps you know: HalfLife Setup plays a Sound File
at the beginning of installation.

When HalfLife Setup tries to play this soundfile this high amount of error
Messages starts appears ... (the same happens when starting the game HalfLife).
After this Soundtest a new Window become opened:
Setup has determinated that some system components may be less than requirements:
Digital Sound:     WAVE Support Requirred

Whats's this ? Who i can install this WAVE Support?

example patch to add loadperf.dll and simple UnloadPerfCounterTextStringsW stub preventing .NET 1.1 installer exception

Hello

VS.NET 7.x installers modify AeDebug which results in error message box from .NET Framework 1.1 installer due to an unhandled exception.

With default AeDebug Auto=1 and standalone .NET 1.1 installation you won't notice it because this exception doesn't affect overall success result of  installer.
You can capture output from console to see winedbg actually spawned.

VS.NET 7.x installers add/modify the following JIT debugging keys:

--- snip ---
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger
Auto: 1 -> 0

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger
Default: cordbg.exe !a 0x%x8
--- snip ---

Extract from .msi file:

..
--- snip ---
 
You can simulate the behaviour on clean ~/.wine if you manually set AeDebug/Auto=0 (default is 1) and then execute the standalone .NET 1.1 installer.

Before I start I would like to say that I am aware that maxis came out with a
linux version so please do not flame me. The purpose of this bug report is to
fix wine.

Sim City 3000 is the only program I have that seems to use this but it uses it a
lot. It fills up any debug log with fixme's. So I decided to do some
investigation. I wnt ont Microsofts web site and I found this entry for

> DirectDraw SDK documentation) as the color key for the source surface. If an 
> override is not being set then dckDestColorkey does not contain the color 
> key. The driver should test the surface itself.

What this sounded like to me was that if I made DIB_DirectDrawSurface_Blt ignore
  the DDBLT_KEYSRCOVERRIDE flag then the worst result would be that it used the
wrong colors. With this in mind I went into dlls/ddraw/dsurface/dib.c and 
changed it so it in fact ignored this flag. The result was better then I expected.

At the beginning of the game there is a unique menu system that was invisible
because nothing was being drawn. When I made DIB_DirectDrawSurface_Blt ignore
the flag the menu system showed up almost right (at least it isn't invisible
anymore). This minor change improves how the whole game works. In fact there are
very few places that this does not make the game look better. It seems that in
this case at least the only thing it is used for is to mask out portions of the
area that is being drawn.",7,"0"

"WINE-743","WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE handling broken ? (was: Problem in winpos.c which ends in an infinite loop)","I tried to install the game Zork : Grand Inquisitor ( probably a win16 app) and
the installer crashed.
With the debugger I Obtained the attached log.

As you can see
1) CreateWindowExA is called (9170)
2) X11DRV_CreateWindow send the WM_CREATE message to the window (9168)
3) the window procedure of the app is executed (9162) and call
SetForegroundWindow (9161)
4) WINPOS_SetActiveWindows is then called (9160) and send the WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE
(9159)
5) When the windows procedure receive the message (9153) it call
SetForegroundWindow (9152)
6) return to 4

Commenting the lines (see attached diff) in winpos.c wich send the
WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE avoids
the infinite loop and makes the installer work.
The installer runs perfectly under Windows 98.

It seems that the app's windows procedure does not expect a WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE
message.

"WINE-24299","Starcraft 2: Custom maps with dialog labels using style ABChoiceBackButtonText crashes game","Created attachment 30620
Modified map that doesn't crash

When using some custom map SC2 may crash. With the latest version of the Multitasking Trainer by stet_tcl it does crash as soon as you select the race. By trial and error I found out it was the Enable coach mode: button that made it crash. What makes it different fromt other labels is that it has a style applied to it. That style is ABChoiceBackButtonText. Some other style such as ABChoiceButtonText seem to work fine. If I remove that style specification from all strings in GameString.txt (using Ladik's MPQ Editor) using some sed command the map will run fine.

I've attached a version of the map that induces the crash (with a single ABChoiceBackButtonText label) and a version that doesn't crash. Those should only work as expected with enUS N.A. retail copies as the enGB locale has it's own version of the GameStrings.txt file that I don't think I have modified.

Note that I can't see the ABChoiceBackButtonText style in the list of styles available from the Starcraft 2 Editor don't know if it's related. 

I've included wine's output for both a run of the crash inducing map and the one that runs fine. I haven't been able to run it with WINEDEBUG=+all Sc2 seems to terminate prematurely in that case.

Some other maps also crash for me (ie. The Unit Tester) but I don't know if it's related.",1730,"1"

Wine: 20050524 Debian package.  Wine works fine.

Acemoney (a home accounting program) displays a 'register' for each account 
listing transactions.  By default these transactions should be sorted by date 
order however under wine they are not:  they appear to be displayed in the 
order in which they are entered (and therefore presumably are stored in the 
data file).

The 'Date' column contains a sort arrowhead (indicating that the default sort 
is selected I suppose) though the data is not sorted.  Clicking on the column 
header also does not sort the rows.  Clicking on another column does not re-
sort the rows with the order of the new column.

Column resizing works fine and clicking on the column header does 'depress' it 
like a button but nothing else happens.

Sorting works fine on Win 2000 and Win XP.  Data is not affected and I can 
move between wine and Win XP without causing any corruption.  It is simply the 
display of the data.

I tried switching to a native comctl32 (via a config file) but that failed to 
load and wine/acemoney exited code 1.  Switched back and it works again.  I've

I installed both version 0.9.20 and 0.9.21 to see if the problem was fixed.  The
problem is now worse.  Diamond Mind Baseball loads information from files in a
folder called rptdes.  You can see if it was successful by going to
Reports->Standard and seeing if anything is in the listbox.

Diamond Mind also uses those files (or similar ones in another folder - not
sure) to populate the playing screen.  So now because the files are not getting
loaded I get the message Error loading the report design information.  And
then the program crashes.

I installed Crossover Office.  It appears to use Wine 20050830.  Diamond Mind

"WINE-1805","InternetCrackUrl incorrectly sets dwUrlPathLength","Hi

During some application testing we discovered that WinE does not correctly
mimic the WinINet function InternetCrackUrl. The real WinAPI sets the
dwUrlPathLength member of the URL_COMPONENTS structure to additionally hold
the extra info of the given URL if the extra info is not requested as a
separate component. Although this behaviour is not well documented by the
Win SDK it is for instance implemented on WinXP Win2000 and WinME and
therefore might be considered to be intended by Microsoft.

The following lines of code demonstrate the problem:

   LPCTSTR lpszURL = _T(http://www.myserver.com/myscript.php?arg=1)
   URL_COMPONENTS url

   // call 1: crack out url path and extra info
   ::ZeroMemory(
   url.dwStructSize = sizeof(url)
   url.dwHostNameLength = 1
   url.dwUrlPathLength  = 1
   url.dwExtraInfoLength = 1
   ::InternetCrackUrl(lpszURL 0 0 
   // dwUrlPathLength is 13 holding /myscript.php

   // call 2: only crack out url path
   ::ZeroMemory(
   url.dwStructSize = sizeof(url)
   url.dwHostNameLength = 1
   url.dwUrlPathLength  = 1
   ::InternetCrackUrl(lpszURL 0 0 
   // now dwUrlPathLength should be 19 holding /myscript.php?arg=1
   // while WinE still sets it to 13

OK it is of course no great deal to write code that correctly runs on real
Win systems and on WinE (2-3 lines did it). But programers who rely on this
behaviour will for example wonder why their applications don't transmit any
HTTP GET parameters when they call HttpOpenRequest with lpszObjectName set
to the URL path component returned by InternetCrackUrl...",521,"1"
"WINE-23487","Buccaneer: freezes when changing screen resolution","Created attachment 29315
standard console log

The game Buccaneer: The Pursuit of Infamy (an arcadish Pirates! clone) becomes unresponsive when changing in-game screen resolution. This occurs both in Wine's virtual desktop mode and in fullscreen.

If you  untick the 'Fullscreen' option in the game (so it runs in windowed mode) the freezing doesn't happen and I can switch resolutions successfully.

The game uses the Torque engine there are D3D9 and OpenGL rendering modes available. However selecting OpenGL rendering from the options menu doesn't have an effect: the game always resets itself to the default D3D9 renderer.

You can check out the issue using the demo (122 Mb download size) I added the link to URL.

How to reproduce the issue in the demo:
1. Install the demo and start it by T3D.exe. The game will notify you about the latest update you can install it the game will restart after updating.
2. Go to 'Help & Options' in the menu then select 'Settings'.  Change the screen resolution (default is 1024x768) and press 'Apply graphic changes' >> the game will hang although music is playing on and htop shows the game executable still consumes 50-60 % CPU.

Workaround: playing the game in windowed mode.

I attached the console output when the game freezes. I added winedebug=-dsound to the command line to suppress the tons of dsound related fixmes in the log.

Ensure you have these fonts: simsun.ttc gulim.ttc etc. or change the values with proper font name. This gets the CJK fonts display properly.

When I close (click quit/exit in the menus) Warlords Battlecry III it gets an unhandled page fault. So rather than closing it crashes. Severity does not seem overwhelming as it has not failed to flush its files due to these crash.

I have made no special changes (no patches) to my installation to play this game. The AppDB suggests installing some native DLL files which I haven't done - since single player version ran fine without.

In Lotus 123 (v9) if you highlight across two cell horizontally then go the Edit Copy 123 will crash.  This makes 123 unusable under Wine (why the major severity).  

Also Linux acts really weird until your kill the 123 process

Often items in the rightmost column seems fully visible. However clicking on

listview code considers that the item was not fully visible and thus scrolls 
left by one column to make it fully visible. 
However I think this can be confusing. Also this does not appear to be the

the bug appears in Wine-20040121 and before (don't ask how long). I'm

When starting a game (i.e. telling HL to load a map) the Loading splash
screen is displayed but then the screen is no longer updated the splash
screen stays there until a redraw of the window (i.e. by hiding or
minimizing) is forced. The screen is then repainted in black and stays
black. The game itself however is running fine (you can tell because you
can hear sound when the intro starts or your footsteps when moving
around). When escaping to the menu the menu works.
Judging from a '--debugmsg +all' there are quite a lot of calls to
CreateRectRgn CombineRgn etc.. so those are probably involved in
drawing (I'm not a windows programmer myself). 'REGION_DumpRegion' is
also called a lot (btw: this does nothing more than producing trace 
messages. Is this a bug?). Finally there are calls to BitBlt GetDCEx
and consorts but not as many. I can provide a full log but it is 5 MB

As you can see the URL is a screenshot of a bug that occurs whilst running
Editplus under Wine. What happens is Editplus has a feature which allows you to
save a file and it uploads directly to a server via FTP. A status window opens
to show the percent of the file that has been uploaded. The problem is with
large files it always gets stuck on 100%. The upload is successful but the
status window stays on 100%. In order to get rid of it you have to click
'cancel' every time. The uploaded file is fine but it's just very annoying
having to wait around and click cancel when it gets to 100% every time you
upload a file.

I am using Wine 1.5 and have installed Microsoft office 2010 X86 version. The problem is that when I copy something from onenote and try to paste on linux application i.e gedit open office or even on Wine apps i.e MS word ONENOTE crashes and restarts.

This makes it impossible to copy anything (mainly text) from ONENOTE to any other app. Same bug has been reported before (Bug 18242) for ONENOTE 2007 but it is abandoned at this moment.

It is because of this bug smoothly working ONENOTE becomes unusable. Strange this is but no such problem occurs with other products such as MS word presentation 2010.

I hope that this bug is fixed ASAP.

Wine log for xdnd

Operating System: Kubuntu 10.04 LTS with KDE 4.4.5 / i386 / nvidia grafics driver

Bug is related to winamp a windows music player (www.winamp.com). Other applications may be affected by this bug.

Problem:
Every File drag and dropped to the playlist-window of winamp will duplicated. It generates double entries for every file dropped to the playlist-window.

Version of wine:
This bug has been introduced since version 1.3x. In wine 1.2 everything is fine.

Details:
If you drag drop a file to the main window of winamp no duplicate entries will be generated. But if you drop a file to the playlist-window (a window within the winamp application) you will get two entries (duplicated). So it seems to me that the bug is connected to how the drag drop code specifies the target window.

"WINE-3270","Problem with minimized top-level windows","When running PokerStars client app (downloadable from PokerStars.com 3M
download size) in 'Managed' mode (default) main window often becomes not only
minimized but also resized to 1x1 pixel without any option to restore it back.
With Managed=N or Desktop parameter the problem doesn't occur doesn't
occur either under CrossOver. Problem reported for Gnome/KDE/xfce. 

Steps to reproduce:
- download client from pokerstars.com (3M) install client as 
'wine PokerStarsInstall.exe' (goes smooth)
- start client (should be started from the same directory where .exe resides - 
either as wine PokerStarsUpdate.exe or as wine PokerStars.exe) main window
will be shown. 
- double-click on any table in the list table will be opened and main window
will be minimized (and in fact sized to 1x1). 
- Now click on 'Leave Table' button on the table this table window will be
closed but main window will stay 1x1 sized and won't ever be restored. 
- There is a wierd workaround  (at least under Gnome seems to exist under other
managers either) - if _before_ closing the table window you will click on
main-window-image-in-taskbar once (to remove 1x1 window 'moving' it to the
taskbar) closing table window will restore main window properly.",986,"1"

A number of possible solution:
1. Apps shouldn't find themselves as duplicates (identifiable by their numeric ID).
2. An error message should appear when attempting to merge an app with itself.
3. It certainly shouldn't delete all objects at a bare minimum.

commit  a1e4758f076190dbef7d06f9e10241d0aabe3788
Author: Dan Kegel 
Date:   Tue Nov 6 16:52:19 2007 -0800
It crashes with WINEDEBUG= (access to 0x04030205) and WINEDEBUG=warn+heap (access to 0x55555559) and an assertion aborts the program with WINEDEBUG=+heap.
It crashes when compiling (GCC 4.1.1 from Debian stable) the whole Wine DLLs programs and executables with -O0 -O2 and -O3 so that is probably not due to a compiler optimization screwup.


I've been discussing the issue for a while with Dan and he is able to reproduce the problem.
However all commit a1e4758f... does is fixing two memory leaks. Therefore neither of us feels that the change in this commit should cause a crash. There may be a problem somewhere else. Since it touches the heap subsystem I'm putting severity to major.


While commenting tests in order to reduce the testcase by looking at the traces I found that a crash can be triggered (but not reproducably...) with the single:
test_aligned_realloc(256 512 16)
(everything before and after this line being commented).
Strange.


Attached is a tarball I sent to Dan which contains:
* a script to run the test in various situations. Compilation is not part of the script if you want to run Valgrind you have to edit the location of valgrind to match the location of Wine-improved Valgrind ( http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_and_Valgrind )
* traces created by the script
* I noticed that a 'invalid arena magic' warning is triggered by warn+heap before the crash occurs so I made a trivial patch that adds printing of the invalid arena magic values.
I think it helps debugging the issue by showing the exact kind of overwrite that occurred: 1-byte 2-byte 4-byte which bytes of the arena are affected etc.
With warn+heap (crash) the arena magic is 0x00555555.
With +heap (assert failed) the arena magic is 0x55555555.",8,"0"

We get several mails from people willing to translate some parts of Wine

We should have a common framework set up for doing this very regularly 
consistently and well. 
 
I'd suggest that we create a web page for every language with a database backend 
which creates a new translation ticket for every documentation patch of Wine for 
every language involved (one ticket page per language). 
(e.g. by Alexandre CC'ing documentation patches to this system) 
 
Then everyone who is involved with translating documentation could commit the 
translation for his language into the *foreign language Wine cvs tree* 
and close the corresponding translation ticket on this language webpage. 
Once a month an automated build process would take the entire foreign language 
CVS tree and build new documentation for the web page to download. 
(the idea would be that the main Wine CVS tree would still only contain English 
docu with a short hint at where to get foreign documentation in the README file) 
 
Someone would have to be willing to develop this for us though. 
Any takers ?

I cannot use the mouse to select an area in the generated image to zoom in. In Wine there are two windows opened when you generate a new fractal. One of them is completely black the other one displays the actual image but cannot be activated (the window title is always greyed out).
In Windows only one window is opened which shows the image and the mouse can be used to draw a rectangle and zoom in. That's not working in Wine.

How to reproduce the issue:
1. Unzip the application then run it. Make sure you're running it in Wine's fullscreen mode in virtual desktop mode the various windows in the application are drawn behind the main window.
2. Click on Generation >> New in the Control window a new fractal is generated.
3. Now you should be able to draw a rectangle on the generated image highlighting an area to zoom in but that's ineffective in Wine.

A screenshot of the game under Wine and the WINEDEBUG=+err log follow below.

2. Detailed ground textures cause heavy flickering

It appears as though the detailed textures are drawn as additional polygons
slightly above the lowres-ground model. The flickering looks like the
classical z-buffer error where polygons are sometimes rendered above and in
the next frame below the ground.

3. The overlay in the minimap and in construction menus is not transparent

The camera direction is drawn as a gradient transparent polygon on top of the
minimap in Windows. Under Wine this polygon is opaque. Same applies for the
selections in the construction menu.
See screenshot below.

I get a crash on changing the sound driver setting. To reproduce:
- Download and unzip the snes9x archive.
- Run snes9x.exe. You'll get a dialog saying Unable to initialize XAudio2 since Wine doesn't support that. Click OK.
- Select Sound->Settings... change Sound Driver to Snes9x DirectSound and click OK. The program crashes. Since it saved the DirectSound setting to snes9x.conf you get an immediate crash if you run snes9x.exe again without deleting or editing snes9x.conf.

The crash seems to be related to the sample rate. The default playback rate is 32 KHz. For me if I change Sound Driver to DirectSound and Playback Rate to 48 KHz there is no crash. I can load a SNES ROM and play it with (albeit crackly) sound. The crash happens when selecting any other playback rate.

(There is no graphical output in the default Direct3D mode which I'll hopefully file another bug for. You can select Video->Display Configuration... and change Output Method to DirectDraw to work around that.)

This looks like a regression. A regression test gave this:

Patch to greatly reduce numerical noise in scanf conversion of doubles and long doubles

If I compile the test_scanf.c code attached below using gcc test_scanf.c under MinGW/MSYS  on wine-1.3.26 I get the following results from running the a.exe executable that is created by that build under Wine.

bash.exe-3.1$ echo 1.1e-30 |./a.exe
1.1e-30 is input string
 1.1000004917384256455392e-030 = 3f9b64f8772f16505258 is long double value
 1.1000004917384256198806e-030 =  39b64f8772f16505 is double value
     1.1000004917384e-030: 13:  1.1000009834770454030908e-030 = 39b64f881a45deaf
    1.10000049173843e-030: 14:  1.1000009834770755310078e-030 = 39b64f881a45df5b
   1.100000491738426e-030: 15:  1.1000009834770715022747e-030 = 39b64f881a45df44
  1.1000004917384256e-030: 16:  1.1000009834770711519501e-030 = 39b64f881a45df42
 1.10000049173842562e-030: 17:  1.1000009834770711519501e-030 = 39b64f881a45df42

I annotate the above lines of output to demonstrate what the test application does.

1. Read a string from stdin (in this case 1.1e-30) and output the result.  

2. Transform that string to a long-double value (80-bit floating point) using sscanf with a format string of %Le and output that result in decimal and hexadecimal. The decimal result (in this case 1.1000004917384256455392e-030) immediately demonstrates the bad numerical significance loss in sscanf since the answer has a relative error of ~5e-7 rather than the expected relative error of order ~1.e-20.  The 64-bit mantissa in the hexadecimal representation of the long double is shifted to the left _on output_ by one bit to simulate the hidden bit that occurs for double values to make hex comparisons with the corresponding double in line 3 easier.

3. Transform the string to a double value (64-bit floating point) using sscanf with a format string of %le and output the result in both decimal and (unshifted) hexadecimal form.  The decimal form (of 1.1000004917384256198806e-030) demonstrates a relative error of 5.e-7 rather than the expected relative error of order of 1.e-16.

4-8.  Use sprintf to write the double-precision form of the number to a character string in rounded form using a precision of i where i ranges from 13 to 17. Transform that string to a double value (64-bit floating point) using sscanf with a format string of %le and output the rounded string the value of i and the double result in both decimal and (unshifted) hexadecimal form.  This test indicates how much precision is required for the conversion from double to a rounded string in order to read back a double that is the same as the original double.  In this case at a precision of 16 and beyond sscanf provides consistent results but they are not the same as the original double because of the large numerical noise in the results from sscanf.

I then applied a patch (attached) to wine-1.3.26/dlls/msvcrt/scanf.h that fixes this numerical precision issue for conversions of doubles and long doubles by the scanf family of functions.  (Note wine-1.3.26/dlls/msvcrt/scanf.h and wine-1.3.28/dlls/msvcrt/scanf.h are identical so this patch should apply for wine-1.3.28 as well.)  What the patch does is make sure all calculations during the conversion are done in long double precision with results scaled in such a way that all calculations except a possible multiplication or division at the last are done with integers stored in long double form.  These changes assure exact results for input numbers between 0 and 2^65 - 1 that can be represented exactly in long double form and results with minimal numerical noise in other cases.  Here are the same test results for this patched test case:

bash.exe-3.1$ echo 1.1e-30 |./a.exe
1.1e-30 is input string
 1.0999999999999999999835e-030 = 3f9b64f86cb9cefaf7a0 is long double value
 1.0999999999999999165078e-030 =  39b64f86cb9cefaf is double value
     1.1000000000000e-030: 13:  1.0999999999999999165078e-030 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
    1.10000000000000e-030: 14:  1.0999999999999999165078e-030 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
   1.100000000000000e-030: 15:  1.0999999999999999165078e-030 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
  1.0999999999999999e-030: 16:  1.0999999999999999165078e-030 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
 1.09999999999999992e-030: 17:  1.0999999999999999165078e-030 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf

The results are vastly improved by the attached patch for the scanf family of functions.  Now the relative numerical error for %Le conversion to long double is reduced from 5.e-7 to 2.e-20 and the relative numerical error for %le conversion to double is reduced from 5.e-7 to ~1.e-16.  Furthermore the round trip test of converting  a double to rounded string form and then back to double shows exact agreement. (For other tests with repeating decimal input such as 1.111111111111111111111111111e-30 exact agreement was obtained for a rounded precision of 16.)

Just as a matter of interest here are the results for the same test application (compiled with gcc for Linux) on Linux:

software@raven> echo 1.1e-30 |./a.out
1.1e-30 is input string
  1.0999999999999999999835e-30 = 3f9b64f86cb9cefaf7a0 is long double value
  1.0999999999999999165078e-30 =  39b64f86cb9cefaf is double value
      1.1000000000000e-30: 13:   1.0999999999999999165078e-30 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
     1.10000000000000e-30: 14:   1.0999999999999999165078e-30 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
    1.100000000000000e-30: 15:   1.0999999999999999165078e-30 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
   1.0999999999999999e-30: 16:   1.0999999999999999165078e-30 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf
  1.09999999999999992e-30: 17:   1.0999999999999999165078e-30 = 39b64f86cb9cefaf 
which is identical with the patched wine result except for the 2-digit exponents.

When I created JPL binary ephemerides (consisting of roughly 1.5GB of doubles) from JPL ascii ephemerides with my ephcom-2.0.2 software on Linux and on Wine-1.3.26  built with the attached patch I got exact agreement between the double data for the Linux- and Wine-produced binary ephemerides in most cases.  However 0.04 per cent of the time the double values on the two platforms differed at the 1.e-16 relative difference level which is consistent with scanf errors in the two cases differing on average by one in the last bit of the long double representation.  By chance such small differences would propagate to the double representation (with 11 bits less in the mantissa when counting the hidden bit) roughly 0.04 per cent of the time. So I feel this patched scanf family of functions does very well against the Linux equivalent.

I have classified this apparently long-standing bug after a lot of thought as critical.   The reason for that classification is the scanf family is a fundamental building block for any platform and the numerical precision of the scanf family for double values is critical to a lot of applications (such as ephcom-2.0.2 where I first discovered the issue).  One could argue that a workaround is available (Dan Kegel noted this on the wine-devel list) of using Microsoft's version of msvcrt.dll rather than the Wine version.  So this is not critical because of the availability of that alternative msvcrt.dll.  However there is a chicken/egg problem here.  Presumably some of those apps that use the Microsoft version of msvcrt.dll do so because the scanf numerical precision bug in Wine's version is giving them trouble.  Anyhow applying this patch going forward is fundamental to Wine as an independent platform so that is why I chose to use a critical classification as a first approximation subject of course to any reclassification Wine developers want to make for this bug.",415,"0"

Maybe somebody knows exactly which DLL dependencies I should set? Could 
somebody post a sample 
~/.wine/config that is known working with Terragen 0.8.44? So far debug does not look 
like it is 
throwing the final error message any ideas? Is Xwindows v3.3.6 okay? Terragen 
0.8.44 and DCOM95 are 
now installed. Terragen loads in both of the following cases:1) Using builtin comctl32 
the 
left-column child window select buttons are not all visible just part of the first one. In 
the 
Landscape child window the terrain-sculpting buttons do appear with good icons 
but 
funny text (that text was supposed to be Small Med Large I think).2) Using native 
comctl32 the left-column child window select buttons are all properly visible. But in 
the Landscape 
window the terrain-sculpting buttons do not appear at all. In both cases there is 
another problem - 
I think it is a general case. From the Landscape child window click Surface Map then 
in Surface 
Map click Edit ! 
 
Color then wine Terragen just locks-up. Landscape -> Surface Map -> Tex same 
lock-up. 
Cloudscape -> Edit Cloud Color same lock-up. Water -> Edit Diffuse/Transparent 
Color same 
lock-up. Killing the wine Terragen process seems to be the only recovery (back to the 
console). All 
the rest seems working fine including nice rendering. So if anybody has the .srf file 
format spec in 
full detail that alone might be enough.

Researching the main issue - the application startup problem. 
The problem occurs because application tries to create a COM object using not 
registered class ID. This is a class ID from the OLEAUT32.DLL provided with the 
application. You can fix the problem by registering the dll. 
To register the dll run command: 
regsvr32 OLEAUT32.DLL in the application directory. 
Try to do this instead of installing and using additional dlls.

These installers do not get a button in the taskbar while they're running. I tested this in several versions and found that this is a regression that happened sometime between 0.9.54 and 1.0.1. However I was left with several skipped commits at the end of my regression test. Of those this looks like the most likely culprit:

"WINEHQ.ORG-594","Getting wine-cvs patches in text format","This may not be the WineHQ web site proper but this is the best match I could
find.

The wine-cvs mailing list makes it possible to see each patch that is being
commited to the Wine CVS. However these patches are returned as HTML: '<' is
replaced with  etc. This makes it impossible to apply these patches to a
tree.

E.g. see:
 * the email
   http://www.winehq.com/hypermail/wine-cvs/2002/04/0183.html
 * the patch
   http://cvs.winehq.com/patch.py?id=1019336844871205116462992

It would be nice to have a URL which one can wget and then feed to 'patch -p0'.
This can be done in two ways:
 * the current script could be modified to return a 'text/plain' file (it can
still keep the Changeset info & co as this would be ignored by patch)
 * or the emails could have two URLs on of which returns the text version of
the patch",156,"0"
"WINE-29306","Telltale's games launcher unusable (can't click on buttons)","Created attachment 37898
terminal output

The launcher used by several games from Telltale Games used to work reasonably well in Wine with only Gecko installed (at least those games could be started).
Now the launcher is unusable mainly because none of the buttons in the launcher can be activated thus the games cannot be started. Additionally the launch button appears off-screen only the left part of the button can be seen.

Workaround: winetricks ie8

Steps to reproduce the problem with the demo:
1. Install the demo for Strong Bad Episode 1.
2. Launch the demo by Homestar101.exe and wait for a couple of seconds until the launcher is fully loaded. You can notice that the green  button is off screen. The biggest problem is that that button is unclickable (as well as other buttons in the launcher).

This is due to

I recently resumed some investigations with Windows on ARM apps/installers and ran into a problem due to a kernel 3.2 -> 3.0 downgrade.
The kernel downgrade was necessary because Freescale left Linaro some months ago stalling/halting all Linaro projects targeting i.mx platforms (the last kernels were still buggy as hell anyway).

Back to a Linux 3.0.x kernel now which is being actively developed/maintained within Freescale.
Unfortunately all wine builtins simply segfault on startup.

The code that fails:

NtAllocateVirtualMemory() fails to reserve that range but no return value evaluation takes place hence the initial start address value is still taken.
Dereferencing of user_shared_data (USER_SHARED_DATA) causes the segfault.

(TASK_SIZE = 0x7F000000) -> arch_get_unmapped_area() will not accept address 0x7ffe0000.

I worked around by moving to a 3GiB/1GiB user/kernel virtual memory split -> CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET=0xC0000000.

Anyway the reservation failure should be handled gracefully by either refusing to run (at least on x86 platforms) or accept a new address range.

I don't know if USER_SHARED_DATA at 0x7ffe0000 exists/makes sense for Windows on ARM platforms.

To reproduce this problem easily minimal test program is created. See attached archive cmd_call_batch.tar.xz.

Here are technical details of the problem. To appear following conditions need to be met: 
- bat-script is called using CreateProcess
- name of bat-script is quoted
- some parameters of bat-scrits are quoted.

For example

test2.bat param1 param2

wine runs bat-script using cmd.

Windows XP:
GetWindowsDirectory = C:\WINDOWS
GetSystemDirectory = C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

Wine:
GetWindowsDirectory = c:\windows

The differences are the case of the names returned (particularly the drive

the response of the 32-bit directory name for GetSystemDirectory.

Some deeper investigation revealed that the GDI's DIB exception handler is involved in this problem. Here's the scenario:

1. Thread A calls a GDI function. The function takes the gdi_section.
2. Thread B raises an exception (could be a C++ exception). The call_vectored_handlers() function is called to call the handlers. The vectored_handlers_section is entered.
3. Thread B execues the X11DRV_DIB_FaultHandler() which eventually leads to a call to GetObjectW() and in turn GDI_GetObjPtr(). The last one blocks on gdi_section.
4. Thread A throws an Access Violation exception in the DIB functions. The call_vectored_handlers() function is called but this time it blocks on vectored_handlers_section

A possible solution would be to replace the vectored_handlers_section by a RW lock. This would ensure that multiple exception handlers are called simultaneously while still maintaining consistency in case the vectored exception handler list needs to be changed.",45,"0"

same procedural content engine and pretty much all of them function as intended
and don't exhibit that bug.
Essentially:
1-upon starting the render window is correctly dimensioned as full screen (800x600)
2-after content generation bar reaches completion 3D starts running in full
screen correctly
3-after the first screen blackout the render window is truncated on the left
(+-20% of screen) and bottom (+- 30% of screen)

Playback goes well anyway only minor defects such as overly strong HDR-like
effect and some missing fonts in the background (but only some - this may come
from a build defect as other fonts appear)

Problem occurs in both GLSL and ARB modes (they seem identical otherwise). It
has been made for Geforce2-level hardware.

It once seemed to be very sensitive to sound emulation (required OSS driver
emulation) but now works with ALSA with 'standard' acceleration.

No error message in console when the bug occurs (only thing appearing is the
frame buffer size stub - making available RAM 128 Mb changes nothing) - as such

Hello

I have a windows application that uses CryptoAPI.

When I encrypt/decrypt the same data on Windows everything works fine. When I encrypt/decrypt the same data on Wine everything works fine too. The problem happens when I encrypt on Windows and decrypt on Wine. I made a simple application to show that encrypted results differ.

Wine version: 20020411-6 (obtained a couple of nights ago from Ximian)  
 
I had to rebuild my system from a HD failure last week. Latest Wine 
version doesn't seem to work with Quicken Deluxe 99:  
 
Program installs ok. I can open up my restored data files. I open the register  
and begin to enter a new entry. I enter the date press TAB enter the check  
number and press TAB. Quicken freezes up. I can quit the program by going back  
to the shell I launched Wine from and pressing control-c. I also note that CPU  
utilization JUMPS when this happens from 8% to more than 50% (using top to  
monitor).  
 
Also I notice that if I use the mouse and not the TAB key I can get by that  
point and continue entering data. When I get to entering the check amount  
Quicken tells me to enter a number in nnn.nn format. Well I did! Furthermore  
even opening the little Quicken calculator doesn't work. No numeric entry in a  
currency field is understood.

Jeff Part of the problem that the developers with of wine face is that we need 
bug reports for programs that we do not have access to. So bug reports for any 
program are nesessary and appreciated. However at this point the ximian release 
of wine is 3 releases behind. Winehq releases a new version of wine usually 
about once a month.  
 
Development in wine is very active and this bug might be fixed in a more current 
release. For that reason it is recomended that you install from tarball or 
better yet CVS. 
 
Building Wine from source is harder to do than installing from Ximian. I know 
that for sure since I use ximian. Its one sweet package manager. That being said 
though the amount of extra effort is not IMO that much.  
 
 
If ugrading your wine does not fix the problem a trace (wine --debugmsg +dialog 
...) would be usefull.

Thankyou for the additional information. If you still see this with the latest 
release of wine at least we have a couple of places to look at. I think that 
this one is the most interesting This is from Steve Varadi first post 
 
> fixme:shdocvw:WBOC_GetControlInfo stub: LPCONTROLINFO = 0x4209df18 
 
If I recall correctly shdocvw defaulted to native builtin and only recently 
(within the last couple of months) changed to  the following. 
 
shdocvw     = builtin native 
 
 
This looks like a regression as well. In his next postSteve Varadi wrote the 
following 
 
> This way Quickenw is unusable. I never experiented this kind of problem with 
> Quicken. It was working more than five years for me under wine. 
 
> Could anyone give some hints what went wrong?? 
 
So I think that using a native shdocvw.dll might solve your problem but it 
won't fix wine.  
 
 
------- Additional Comments From JeffMay  earthlink.net  2002-07-23 19:35 ------- 
Additional information: I was asked to replace the builtin shdocvw.dll with a 
native version which I did.  No change in behavior.  I then ran wine -debugmsg 
+dialog QW.EXE from the Quicken program directory.  Here is a copy of the

Additional clue: I just noticed that when Wine locks up after pressing TAB to 
leave the NUM column and after I press CTRL-C to exit Wine reports: 
 
/usr/bin/wine: [: too many arguments 
Wine failed with return code 
/usr/bin/wine: [: too many arguments

Latest update... (sorry it's been so long family emergency came up over the weekend) 
 
The bug still exists but has a work-around. I updated my Wine configuration to use 
only native DLLs. 
I then  
ran Quicken noting on the can't find xxxxx.DLL messages. My wife's machine runs 
Windows 
98 so I was able  
to experimentally move the missing DLLs to the .wine/fake_windows/Windows/System 
directory. 
Everything now  
seems to work. When I get back home tonight I'll make a list of the required DLLs 
there was about 
six that  
needed to be brought in.

So we need to know which dll's these were. That should help a little 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From JeffMay  earthlink.net  2002-07-31 19:51 ------- 
Here are the native DLLs I had to employ to make Quicken work right: 
 
ADVAPI32.DLL 
COMCTL32.DLL 
COMDLG32.DLL 
GDI32.DLL 
MSVCRT.DLL 
SHLWAPI.DLL

"WINE-2699","richedit behaves incorrectly with ES_DISABLENOSCROLL style losing functionality","Fully reproducible. A richedit control with the style ES_DISABLENOSCROLL (same
#define value as ES_NUMBER) accepts no keyboard input at all. This alone may
account for a large number of richedit-based applications that just won't work
under Wine.

I have determined that toggling this single style flag makes a richedit control
unusable. I compiled two bare bone applications with MSVC++. The only difference
between the applications was the ES_NUMBER style for the richedit resource (same
value as ES_DISABLENOSCROLL in order to disable scroll bars instead of hiding them).

Under Wine 20050111 (running on Slackware 10/GNOME) the test application with
richedit style ES_DISABLENOSCROLL did not accept any input while the other test
application without this flag functioned normally.",9,"0"

Bug #43923 has a similar issue except that bug occurred only in Wine-Staging. Since Wine-3.0-rc1 the game crashes in vanilla Wine too just after starting it.
Tested with the Origin version (installed in a 32-bit prefix) and with the Steam version (in a WOW64 prefix).
Tried the game in Windows XP and in the default Windows 7 profiles.

"WINE-20112","Cannot install Directx on Fedora 11 with 64-bit wine","Background:
Using Steam I'm trying to start Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition. Before it can start for the first time the program tries to install DirectX. This is not successful so the game cannot be loaded.

Have tried installing the DirectX setup files manually and via winetricks but with no luck.

Using wine package 1.1.29-3.fc11 @updates-testing

Error returned:
Trying to load PE image for unsupported architecture (AMD-64)
wine: could not load LC:\\windows\\temp\\DX1a3d.tmp\\infinst.exe: Bad EXE format for 

Investigation details:
The problem seems to be related to wine choosing the correct binary to begin with then being unable to run a 64-bit binary which is also part of the install (i.e. it uses wine32 all of the time when some of the time it should be using wine64).

Looking at the behaviour of wine it correctly identifies that DXSETUP.exe is a 32-bit file and uses wine32 as expected. However there is an executable file that is supposed to run as part of the install:

infinst.exe: PE32+ executable for MS Windows (GUI) Mono/.Net assembly

This is a 64-bit file so wine32 chokes on it and the install fails.
Is this restricted to Fedora 11 or is it common to any wine environment where wine32 and wine64 are present?

The infinst.exe application can be run successfully using wine64 infinst.exe and simply returns:
fixme:heap:HeapSetInformation 0x7f98ba590000 0 0x7f98bcd4fd10 4

If wine32 infinst.exe is run it returns:
Trying to load PE image for unsupported architecture (AMD-64)
Trying to load PE image for unsupported architecture (AMD-64)
wine: could not load LH:\\Download\\Windows\\DX\\infinst.exe: Bad EXE format for 

Additional information:
The temporary folder (shown above) that is created when the files are extracted disappear too quickly to be looked at in detail. I got a better look at infinst.exe by extracting all the cab files with:

#!/bin/sh

I left out multiple non-failing 'InitializeSecurityContextA' calls denoting different connection stages/phases.

The failing call to 'ApplyControlToken' returning 'SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION' is mostly harmless.
The last call to 'InitializeSecurityContextA' -> 'schan_InitializeSecurityContextA' also fails returning 'SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE'. .

That's on the connection/protocol tear-down path (SSL close notify message).

fContextReq = 0x811C -> ISC_REQ_STREAM | ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY | ISC_REQ_CONFIDENTIALITY | ISC_REQ_SEQUENCE_DETECT | ISC_REQ_REPLAY_DETECT 

Unfortunately the failing protocol sequence on tear-down path wasn't even responsible for the problem.
It took me some good hours to debug this out as the error code is internally maintained and propagated through some objects until the C++ exception is finally raised.

At one time during SSL connection sequence the client code checks if the required context attributes are met.
It specifically looks for 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' while Wine returned 0x100 ('ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY').

You need to handle (return) more context attributes at least 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_REPLAY_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_CONFIDENTIALITY' 'ISC_RET_STREAM' in addition to 'ISC_RET_ALLOCATED_MEMORY'.

"WINE-17222","Extreme slowness in multiple games - nVidia/KDE4/openSUSE","For many of the last few releases of Wine (somewhere not long after 1.0) I've experience extreme slowness across multiple systems and multiple games that wasn't present pre-1.0 or in 1.0 itself.

Specifically I've noted slowness that makes gameplay impossible in:

- Age of Empires (1997)
- Birth of the Federation (1999)
- Age of Empires 2 (1999)
- Medieval 2: Total War (2006)
- Star Trek: Legacy (2006)

The slowdown is significant and affects as you can see a wide range of games on three machines that I own all of which are more than capable of playing certainly the first few titles on the list.

Of the three machines I own and have tested Wine on the following are common threads:

- Running openSUSE 11.0 or 11.1
- Running latest Wine (1.1.14)
- Desktop environment is KDE4 (though no improvement running with GNOME)
- All nVidia cards (but range from an old FX5200 through to an 8400)
- All using Wine KDE4 and nVidia from openSUSE repositories.

That aside they have nothing in common. Two are 32-bit one is 64-bit. Two are running relatively old graphics cards one is running a fairly new one. Two are Intel machines one is AMD. Two have 512MB of RAM one has 2GB.

I like to do my bit for Wine by filing bug reports for various apps but this slowdown is hindering me somewhat! I don't know a great deal about how to start debugging but if someone can suggest to me how I can help diagnose this problem I'd be more than happy to help :)",193,"0"

cause buffer overflows in msvcrt.*printf.

There are safeguards of sorts in pf_vsnprintf but they only check the field
width which is not even relevant for one of the two cases as the 64-bit integer
code uses the (safe) pf_fill function to expand the number.  (Checking
flags.Precision here instead of flags.FieldWidth when deciding whether to
dynamically allocate memory for the representation of the number before padding
and changing the behaviour of pf_integer_conv which is also unsafe would
eliminate this buffer overflow.)

The other case is more complicated as a formatting string is reconstructed and
sent to the system sprintf.  The 40 character buffer allocated (unless a larger
minimum field width is specified) can easily be overrun with large floating
point value converted with the 'f' specifier for example or again any value if
the precision given is large.  More advanced calculations or use of snprintf is
required.

Additionally when extra memory is allocated pf_vsnprintf uses the pointer to
the static buffer instead of the dynamically allocated one in the HeapFree call.",1,"0"

I'd like to tell that MaxPayne (both 1 _AND_ 2) Don't run anymore Under
Wine-20031016 and Wine-CVS_200310?? (where '??'' >= '16')...

I'ven't Changed my Wine's config - since 20030911 but still Max Payne 1 - that
i _Known_ to run well under Wine-20030911 (and also some older versions i've
tested) ceased to work. maybe the Recent split of NTDLL_KERNEL -> NTDLL KERNEL
broken some things up ?

i did this to try and get an extra info. : wine MaxPayne.exe >& MaxPayne-trace.log

"WINE-32674","Fotostation does not play video","Created attachment 43105
Partial output from Fotostation build 528

Hi everyone

I tried to get a Photo management software called Fotostation 7 to work. AppDB entry is at: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=23409 and I filled out what works and what doesn't. (I am the maintainer of this application)

I had problems playing video. The application requires Quick Time which installs okay. I used version 7.7.1 for this. Also I had problems sending info to Fotoware. I have attached my console output could you please look into this?

Thanks.",112,"0"

relevant trace which shows ioctl status code propagation bug

Hello

while testing my proof-of-concept patch which makes SafeDisc v2 (yuck!) finally work I stumbled across a nasty ioctl status code propagation (completion) bug in wine server.
Wasted several hours on it .. I was suspecting SD issue whole time but its a wine server bug :(

Attached is relevant trace (WINEDEBUG=+seh+tid+relay+ntoskrnl+server wine ./BfVietnam.exe)

Before the bug is triggered the SafeDisc security driver makes several device ioctl requests which return 0xC0000001 (unsuccessful) on purpose e.g. reading debug Drx registers with index that does not exist.
This is intended to fool reversers :-)

The next operation - checking IDT entries should succeed - but does not (as seen from calling client).
The kernel driver completes the operation successfully and returns irp.IoStatus.u.Status == 0 with xxxx bytes in output buffer.
I verified it several times by debugging the kernel driver.

Upon driver ioctl call return get_next_device_request() is triggered again in ntoskrnl event loop which sets the return data (and status code) -> set_ioctl_result().
This queues an APC waking up the client (alertable state).

The client process device ioctl completes with 0 (FALSE) which is wrong.
Further debugging showed that ioctl_completion APC (dlls/ntdll/file.c) returns the errornous status code in get_ioctl_result() when woken up by server.
This error is then propagated in server_ioctl_file() to result in wrong NtDeviceIoControlFile() return code.

What puzzled me is that ioctl->status is correctly set by set_ioctl_result() (=0) but get_ioctl_result() - called within client context - yields the previous error code (0xC0000001 of failed request).

This is either a problem of global vs. thread local error status (global_error vs. current->error/thread) or the ioctl call data is the wrong one.

The following patch works for me letting SD 2.x continue - though i'm not sure if it's right:

When it doesn't work it's broken from the very beginning. At the Sierra intro movie it will not have any sound. Then there will not be any sound throughout the running of the program. There are no other noticeable issues during play. But also when this happens upon a normal exit of the app via its menu system it will normally (always?) hang in the console window after it closes its application window. In the few cases when there is sound upon startup exiting normally does not hang.

Choosing different audio drivers in winecfg seem to have any affect. 

Running 'wineboot -s' or 'wineserver -k' doesn't seem to help either.

For a while it seemed like switching the default settings Windows Version in winecfg back between 'Windows XP' and 'Windows 2000' would help but usually not. Probably just a coincidence though as sometimes it will run fine anyway and it certainly doesn't work every time.

"WINE-8440","Heavy Weather runs too slow / possible serial port baud rate issues?","When running HeavyWeather inside of wine - the app starts - but when the app
comes up - it uses 100% of the CPU.  And it's really really slow.  When the GUI
comes up - it makes requests via the serial port to get the data for about 15
different fields that are displayed.  With an older version of wine (same
hardware) - this took about 2 seconds to get all 15 fields.  

Now it takes about 5 seconds _per field_ to get the data.  Eventually all of
the fields fill in - but CPU usage stays locked at 100% - and any interaction
that I try to have with the application is really slow.

The application then crashes within 3 to 4 minutes.

While the application is running this is printed out on the terminal:

err:file:GetOverlappedResult PENDING status after waiting!
err:file:GetOverlappedResult PENDING status after waiting!
err:file:GetOverlappedResult PENDING status after waiting!


The trace (that I'll attach shortly) indicates a really slow baud rate has been
selected:

000d:trace:comm:dump_dcb bytesize=8 baudrate=2400 fParity=0 Parity=0 stopbits=1


The application doesn't provide any configuration for baud rate.

It's basically unusable in its present form - and this is a regression - it used
to run much better in wine.

On the mailing list Detlef Riekenberg indicated:

>If the App has no options to configure the Serial Port
>it may use the default COM-Settings.

>Old Wine versions returned always 38400 as Baud-Rate and

"WINE-40373","Double free in RPCRT4","Created attachment 54078
idl file

RPCRT4 can double free parameter allocations from NdrStubCall2

The specific situation where this happened is the following:

- The idl file was lsa.idl from ReactOS (file attached)
- The function was LsarRetrievePrivateData
- The parameter was EncryptedData
- It happened in cleanup of marshalled parameters within NdrStubCall2 after calling this function

What happened:

- NdrStubCall2 iterates though the marshaling phases
- On STUBLESS_MUSTFREE:
  - params[i].attr.MustFree is TRUE for parameter i = 2 (EncryptedData)
  - call_freer() is invoked with a pointer pointing to the parameter (pointer to the parameter location!)
  - param->attr.IsByValue is FALSE so pMemory = *(unsigned char **)pMemory
      pMemory is now equal to the value EncryptedData (a pointer to a pointer)
  - NdrFreer[pFormat[0] & NDR_TABLE_MASK] (NdrPointerFree) is called
  - NdrPointerFree calls PointerFree
  - desc = pFormat + *(const SHORT*)pFormat
  - (attr  (In the observed case this is NULL since the function returned NULL in that OUT parameter)
  - NdrFreer[*desc & NDR_TABLE_MASK] (NdrPointerFree) is called with current_pointer (doing nothing since it's NULL)
  - Pointer is not within pStubMsg->Buffer
  - attr & RPC_FC_P_ONSTACK is not set (this is different on midl!)
  - NdrFree(pStubMsg Pointer) is called freeing the pointer
 - On STUBLESS_FREE:
   - params[i].attr.ServerAllocSize is != 0
   - HeapFree(GetProcessHeap() 0 *(void **)pArg) is called on the pointer that was freed before.

I cannot say exactly what is wrong here but I see 2 potential problems:
- The type for the parameter has different flags between midl and widl (the parameter data is the same) where widl is missing the [alloced_on_stack] flag:
midl:
/* 2076 */	
			0x11 0x14	/* FC_RP [alloced_on_stack] [pointer_deref] */
/* 2078 */	NdrFcShort( 0xffb6 )	/* Offset= -74 (2004) */

widl:

"WINE-3636","[LaunchINFSectionEx - stub] MDAC 2.7 installs but its DLLs never get unpacked","A lot of VB apps use MDAC (http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/mdac/downloads/).
They tend to include mdac_typ.exe the mdac installer and run it but
unfortunately
Wine doesn't seem to run it properly. (I'm testing using mdac 2.7 sp1 fwiw.)

First the MDAC installer refuses to run unless the registry key for IE6
is present.  (OK that's easy to work around... if you're a programmer.
It probably ought to be a winecfg pulldown.)

Second even if the MDAC installer runs all it does is install a bunch of
directories under c:\windows\RegisteredPackages.  The DLLs needed
by the VB app are locked up in .cab's in those directories. 
In the app I'm trying to install the installer then fails with
err:module:import_dll Library MSDART.DLL (which is needed by
LC:\\windows\\system32\\msadox.dll) not found
 Something somehow is supposed to be triggering an unpack but it's not happening.
(See http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/delivery/download/download_node_entry.asp

When starting some applications (e.g. the game Master Of Orion 2) Wine sets the
resolution to something smaller (640x480?).

In a way that CtrlAlt+/CtrlAlt- do no longer work for correcting the resolution.

And not in a way that it was possible to play the game.

"WINE-29373","Window decorations lost in virtual desktop mode","Window decorations (title bar borders) are missing when certain full-screen games/apps are running in virtual desktop mode.

One example is Crystal Cubes (a small freeware Tetris clone download link added to url):
1. Create a new wineprefix set a virtual desktop sized to 1024x768.
2. Install the game use winetricks to install native d3dx9_36.dll
3. Start the game (by default it is running in full-screen mode) and see that window decorations are missing.

Further decoded:

I haven't found information on register X18 being used for TEB hence this is another guess.
There is no initialization of X18 in caller chain and even in the whole app code.
Running the whole .text segment through disas only reads through ADD and LDR instructions can be found.

err:d3d:IWineD3DImpl_IsPixelFormatCompatibleWithRenderFmt Unable to check compatibility for Format=WINED3DFMT_R16G16_FLOAT

After looking in the wine code I have found out that what happens is that Civ calls the function IDirect3D9Impl_CheckDepthStencilMatch (no error of the application on that)

The implementation of wine then calls IWineD3D_CheckDepthStencilMatch which then calls

IWineD3DImpl_IsPixelFormatCompatibleWithRenderFmt

for each format that the adapter supports until it finds a supported format:

Problem:

IWineD3DImpl_IsPixelFormatCompatibleWithRenderFmt tries to match the supported pixel format of the adapter with the requested format.
If the supported pixel format of the adapter is of type WGL_TYPE_RGBA_ARB it tries to getColorBits of the format even if the format to try is a  floating format getColorBits responds with an error and same does IWineD3DImpl_IsPixelFormatCompatibleWithRenderFmt. Certainly the answer is correct (FALSE) but the problem is that it fills the screen with ERR that are due to wine checking things for which there is no need as they are directly false.

Possible solution: to do IWineD3DImpl_IsPixelFormatCompatibleWithRenderFmt right away check if:
cfg->iPixelType == WGL_TYPE_RGBA_ARB and format_desc is a floating format then return FALSE right away no need to fill ERR

same if
cfg->iPixelType == WGL_TYPE_RGBA_FLOAT_ARB and format_desc is not a floating format then return FALSE right away no need to fill ERR

If you do not like this solution getColorBits could be modified so that it does not file an error for floating point formats but just responds with 0 for all bit sizes when the format is a floating point without filling an error.

What do you prefer?

Can somebody propose a patch with this kind of behaviour or something better so that my Civ4 does not respond with this myriad of errors?

The myriad of unnecessary checks and of reports of ERR causes a some slowness that can be quantified eliminated unnecessary checks.",57,"0"

"WINE-22466","Zombie Driver: graphical glitches when using hardware vertex shaders","Created attachment 27522
graphical anomalies in the game

In Zombie Driver (retail version patched to 1.1.4) you can observe the following two issues when hw. vertex shaders are enabled in Wine: 
#1 all characters (a.k.a. zombies) in the streets have strange colors (white-pink/white-yellow)
#2 grey lines are across the screen when in-game shadows are turned on.

The game is based on the Ogre3D engine.

Workaround: disable vertex shader support in winecfg's graphics tab.

How to reproduce the bug:
After installation make sure you have the latest (1.1.4 as of writing) version of the game. Launch the game a configuration window will popup. Start a new game by selecting 'Story mode': cruise the streets in your car until you come across some zombies >> watch them in strange colors.

Note #1: there is a demo available for the game (still at version 1.06) in which the issues are not present (using the same Wine version and configuration of course). I suppose one of the changes in the game's graphical engine causes the glitches in the rendering. The issue can be observed from patch 1.1.1 onward.

Note #2: the game will automatically install OpenALDirectXPhysX and some MS VC++ libraries. You need to set 'openal32.dll' to 'native' in order to start the game properly.

Note#3: if you have game version 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 I suggest upgrading to the latest 1.1.4 version. The patch corrects some stability issues which can be observed in Wine too (the game hangs in an early stage).

regression but no idea what makes this regression.

"WINE-12689","Input messages lingering in server slowing down wine","Created attachment 12347
testcase for problem

Attached testcase illustrates the problem. The problem was originally found in a fan-developed Forsaken mod. I couldn't get feedback on this on wine-devel so I'm opening a bug for this. Close if it's not a bug or is non-fixable.

How to reproduce: hold a key and move mouse over the window preferably also clicking mouse buttons main loop latency steadily increases from 10 to 50 (and even 100) in a short time. In a game this means going from 100 fps to 20 or 10 just because of input messages. Has to be noted that in the actual game the rate of slowdown seemed at least 2-3 times faster when just holding one key and moving mouse for reasons I don't know but the testcase still should enough to show the problem.

What the testcase is doing is bad practice it's basically refusing to process certain types of messages and PeekMessage just once during a loop is probably bad as well but that's what the game was originally doing in its main game loop. There are several concerns about it:

1) No slowdown happens on Windows either in game or in this testcase. No matter how much I move the mouse holding key and clicking madly it shows same stable 15-16 ticks latency in the testcase. I don't know what it does but somehow it handles this situation better than Wine.

2) Can this (broken) way of doing things be exposing some inefficiency in message handling maybe something that could use optimization? I tried to put debug hacks into queue_hardware_message() it seems that when slowdown is already VERY bad in Forsaken (10fps) message queue in wine server has about 400 or maybe 600 messages. Is that kind of processing overhead per message inevitable? (This is happening on AMD Athlon(tm) 3200+). Perhaps somebody who knows that part of code well may be interested in looking into performance issues in this case. Because if 400-600 messages in the queue slow down the application to a crawl then who knows perhaps it decreases performance of more well-behaved but input-intensive apps as well just less drastically (holding one or several keys to move all the while aiming with mouse and abusing mouse buttons is a common thing in games so there can be quite a few input messages flooding the server).",1234,"1"

Prerequisites:

---
1. clean WINEPREFIX
2. sh mywinetricks -q wmicore
3. sh winetricks -q dotnet20
4. download .NET 3.0 Framework installer from: http://download.microsoft.com
/download/4/d/a/4da3a5fa-ee6a-42b8-8bfa-ea5c4a458a7d/dotnetfx3setup.exe
(sha1sum: 
a566bcd2ffffc3842a95adc57f7df3f8cd11577f)
5. export _SFX_CAB_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST=1 (workaround see bug 9158)
6. wine ./dotnetfx3setup.exe

It might take a while until all required packages are downloaded using BITS.

Note: If you need to redo steps backup the directory dotnetfx304506.30 from
c:\\windows\\temp to a different location remove ~/.wine copy
dotnetfx304506.30 again to c:\\windows\\temp to prevent BITS from
downloading over and over again.

The WCF installer still fails:

Oh joy LSA again ...

There already exist other bugs falling into same problem domain example: bug 16418

If developer resources are short maybe this could be part of some SoC project: making transition from current approach towards LSA rpc interface and lsass (and fleshing out stubs of course).

http://www.hsc.fr/ressources/articles/win_net_srv/msrpc_lsarpc.html

I fleshed the stub a bit just for proof and it gets the WCF installer further.

"WINE-28039","IAudioClock_GetPosition must ignore underruns (MacOS)","GetPosition is critical because the new winmm on mmdevapi layer relies on it for its buffer management. Currently neither winealsa nor winecoreaudio entirely fulfill GetPosition's contract.

GetPosition yields the stream position of the sample that is currently playing through the speakers. My tests show that it ignores underruns and is therefore not identical to a clock.  One can derive at least 2 tests from that:

1. GetPosition <= elapsed time * samples/sec (cannot hear the future).
2. GetPosition <= sum of samples fed to the device.
3. GetPosition == sum of samples once all have been played.
4. Getposition is monotically increasing (except when Reset).

Actually GetPosition does not yield samples replace the above with GetPosition / GetFrequency * samples per sec to be correct.

My tests attached to bug #27937 show that:
- winecoreaudio fails test 3 (then 2).
- winealsa with dmix fails test 1 during the first seconds of play.
- winealsa with pulse fails test 1 much worse.
See bug #27937 comment #1 and 2 for log snippets.

On MacOS GetPosition appears to continue to grow in the presence of underruns violating 2 and 3.  Hence the name of the present issue.


Note that underruns are unknown to WINMM. A perfectly legal use is:
waveOutOpen()
waveOutPrepare(hugeboomheader)
waveoutPrepare(clickheader)
waveoutPrepare(ouchheader)
waveoutPrepare(beepheader)
then write the headers as the conditions arise (arguably dsound's mixing would be more adequate).  Guess what happens when GetPosition grows playing nothing between 2 beeps?",571,"1"

--- snip ---

It seems if WinVerifyTrust fails that way the caller is not supposed to clean up e.g. calling WinVerifyTrust with WTD_STATEACTION_CLOSE -> WINTRUST_DefaultClose.
The web installer never does - hence the handle + additional data is leaked.

This leaked file handle later leads to a sharing violation when urlmon tries to copy the new file from download cache to destination (DownloadBSC_OnStopBinding):

--- snip ---
0031: create_file( access=c0010000 attributes=00000040 sharing=00000007 create=1 options=00001040 attrs=00000000 objattr={rootdir=0000sd={}name=L} filename=/home/focht/.wine/dosdevices/c:/windows/temp/21006.01/1033/VS_PRO/wcu/vc90sp1/vc_red.cab )
0031: create_file() = SHARING_VIOLATION { handle=0000 }
...
--- snip ---

After 3 download + replacement tries it gives up.

Properly internally cleaning up (closing the file handle ...) helps the installer/urlmon to replace the file.

I was trying to use a statistical program called PAST under Wine. It use to 
run OK but recently (with new Wine versions - wine-20030508 rpm version for 
Mandrake 9.1) I get some problems related to variant array allocation.
Following is the feedback from the program owner Oyvind Hammer 
(oyvind.hammer@nhm.uio.no). The Program site is 
http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past

--------  quote ----------
To be precise the problem is as follows. In Delphi I do
a:=VarArrayCreate([1213] varDouble)
This should allocate a variant array of size 2x3. And as
expected when I query the dimensions of the array in
Windows I get
VarArrayHighBound(a 1) = 2
and
VarArrayHighBound(a 2) = 3
However under Wine I get the reverse meaning that
Wine has allocated a 3x2 array:
VarArrayHighBound(a 1) = 3
and
VarArrayHighBound(a 2) = 2
This causes Variant index out of bounds when I refer
to the cell a[13] for example.

Terminal output

Clicking one of the items in the menu bar without moving the cursor (so it remains hovering above the menu bar item not the menu itself) usually results in garbage appearing in the status bar. Hovering over a different item in the menu bar can make this garbage text change (to other garbage). Once in a while the status bar will be blank instead (which is the expected behavior).

"WINE-40253","Build regression: Can't remove fonts: is a directory (--with-wine64 shared wow64)","I've updated my git tree with 1.9.5 and now I have this error while

setup):

It says fonts is a directory and can't be removed.

I do out-of-tree builds. The 32bit directory doesn't exists when I run
configure. After running configure the 32bit build tree is there and
contains a fonts directory with a single Makefile in it.

I had no such error with Wine 1.9.4 and I don't have it when compiling
stand-alone 32bit Wine or the 64bit shared wow part.

Wine displays strange rays in some places. It is easy to reproduces in the sewers (right at the beginning) where water splashes from the ceiling: the rays are displayed in addition to the water effect.

The attached screenshot was made later into the game but shows the same thing.

patch v1

The setup32.exe of EG (Evangelisches Gesangbuch) fail before end of setup. The reason is on unxpected result on DdeClientTransaction. The second reason is probably programming error of this app.
The app works as fallow:
- DdeCreateStringHandleA with Progman
- then DdeClientTransaction with hszItem == Pragman and hszTopic == Pragman.
- after this it parses the data returned by previous command.
at this stage it will try to parse NULL pointer and fail. At this point i would say it is an app problem. But it works on windows and looks like it returns NULL in really rare cases.

On my machine (PC Clone Mandrake Linx 9.0 Wine 20021007 installed via RPM  
from the Cooker tree) Wine crashes with a segmentation fault any time I try to 
run it from a user who does not exist in /etc/passwd. All the actual human  
users on my network are authenticated via LDAP from another Mandrake box so  
they don't need entries in /etc/passwd (although I've created them now so we  
can run Wine). 
 
This was a bear of a problem to find I had thought originally that only root  
was able to run Wine due to some config problem. I'm not sure what prompted me  
to try to create a local dummy user and test it. I'm also not sure if the error  
is only related to LDAP or if it will happen with any alternate authentication  
(NIS winbind or whatever) since all I have to do is stick the user  
in /etc/passwd to get it to work. 
 
I should point out that I also had this problem with Wine 20020804 which came  
with Mandrake 9 - I upgraded to the latest package on Cooker to see if it fixed  
the problem before I discovered what the problem was.

ttf-wqy-microhei:
0.2.0-beta-1

WenQuanYi Micro Hei is used as a replacement of SimSun in Ubuntu Wine package SimSun is the default GUI font for Chinese version of Wine/Windows.

After 5a45e3474141536b02cfc4e924be3aacbd6ad2c5 ( usp10: Implement GPOS Pair Adjustment Positioning Subtable. )  the glyph pitch is wrong when display string with ScriptStringOut using WenQuanYi Micro Hei.

The simplest way to reproduce this bug is :
1. Make sure WenQuanYi Micro Hei is installed and set as replacement of SimSun 
2. Open wine iexplore with LC_ALL=zh_CN.utf8
3. type some characters into the address bar for example '/' '' '.' 

Expect result:
The pitch between different glyphs should be a suitable value
Actual result:
The pitch between two '/' is larger then normal pitch between two '>' is even larger pitch between two '.' is zero pitch between two '<' is negative.

winetricks usp10 workaround the bug.

serial ports: turn off IEXTEN when ICANON is turned off

(man termios for details)

When wine sets the parameters on a serial port (set_line_control()) although it turns off ICANON it does not disable IEXTEN. On Linux it probably isn't a problem because the tty driver disables IEXTEN behavior when ICANON is off but on FreeBSD the tty driver still gives special treatment to the input stream when ICANON is off but IEXTEN is on.

Simple fix: where ICANON is turned off also turn off IEXTEN.

The problem is evident when running the Nirvis CDJ application which communicates with Sony CD jukeboxes via serial port and a Slink-e controller. Without this fix it mostly works but there are occasional subtle failures (e.g. identification of some CDs fails).",3,"0"

able to run this class of applications.  I've been trying to run Progress Client
with Wine for about three years now and this is the last thing stopping me!

I'm running this on a Debian 'woody' system with X 3.3.6 using the Wine nightly
builds (currently stamped 20001205).

Here are the logs from the console while I run this:

"WINE-15603","Screen periodically erased in Starfleet Command II","Every few seconds the game will freeze and and the screen will be overwritten with a random solid color starting from the top.  This clearing of the screen happens slowly over the course of a few seconds and you can see as the bitmap is erased one scanline at a time.  After the screen is cleared the display will refresh and the game will run normally for a few seconds.  This repeats continually.

This occurs with Wine 1.1.4 and 1.1.6.  The game runs fine under Wine 1.1.2.  No other versions were tested.

This occurs in Fedora & Kubuntu (both x86_64) using NVidia drivers.  No other systems were tested.",187,"0"

The Comment fields do not work properly. First when I open an existing pdf document with Comments and click on the Comments tab at the bottom left corner of the screen the text of the existing comments is not shown. (The username is shown but not the comment.) Hovering the mouse cursor over the comment does bring a popup yellow window that reveals the comment.

Also creating a new comment fails. It creates the comment but the text is not saved so when you go back to the comment you just created the text has vanished. This is obviously a show stopper for those of us who need to use the comments functionality.

"WINE-22384","DbgHelp doesn't support DWARF-2 on Mac OS X","Mac OS X has long had support for DWARF-2. Unfortunately the current implementation of DWARF-2 support in DbgHelp is tied to ELF. This means it can't directly be used on Mac OS X because Mac OS X does not support ELF.

I understand that getting things to work on Linux first takes priority over getting them to work on Mac OS but right now we Mac users are stuck with the inferior stabs format. Plus I get the feeling we're going to need this for 64-bit support. Also DWARF happens to be the default format on 10.5 and up.

I also understand that the scheme that Apple uses is different from ELF systems. Not only does DWARF-2 stuff get its own segment (__DWARF) but when the binary is built the DWARF stuff is put into a dSYM companion bundle. On top of that the dSYM bundle isn't even generated automatically for multi-file builds. This means that:

- We have to invoke dsymutil to create the dSYM bundle.
- We have to install the dSYM bundle (if present) with each binary.
- We have to find the dSYM bundle to get DWARF-2 debug info.

I would be more than willing to help with this. (This might have even made a good SoC project. Too late now...)",1900,"1"

They make you fill out a form with garbage then send a download link which is pretty annoying but nothing I can do about that.

Okay so you get a file called pads_viewer.zip (md5: 33506279ebee7e998b334376618177ff) unzip it and then run `wine PADS9.5_Viewer_mib.exe`

It crashes with terminal output:

The install document says that it requires MSVC 2008 SP1. I installed that using winetricks.

I'm using wine 1.6.1 installed by homebrew. My install is probably ok since many other programs work.

"WINE-19747","Protel99SE-SP6 advsch.dll causes access violation (read @ 0000)","Protel99SE is a Win98 / WinXP application (also called Design Explorer) used to create/open a project database of schematics and pcb layouts then operate on these files with various servers. The main servers are sch & pcb.
 sch is essentially a drawing package tailored to electronic schematic design.
 pcb does the same for pcb design.

pcb primarily uses advpcb.dll and works fine under wine.

sch primarily uses advsch.dll and it is this library which creates an access violation when called.

The sequence of events was :-
1. Protel99SE opened correctly and retrieved the last database loaded MyDesign.ddb
The database contained 3 files FC0000_.PCB first.PCB & First.Sch
2. First.Sch was then mouse clicked to open it.
3. Design Explorer started the schematic editor sch.
4. After some time an Application Error window popped up reporting:-
 Exception EAccessViolation in module AdvSch.dll at 000C81D6.
 Access violation at address 016A81D6 in module 'AdvAch.dll'. Read of
 address 00000000.
5. The checkbox OK was then clicked
6. Design Explorer was closed.

The following terminal command was used to produce the debug file proteldebug.txt. Apologies for the massive size but I wasn't sure what was relevant and what wasn't.

errol@934engenia-desktop:~$ WINEDEBUG=+relay wine c:\program files\Design Explorer 99 SE\Client99SE.exe 2>&1 | tee proteldebug.txt

A copy of the terminal window follows which resulted from the following command:-
  wine c:\program files\Design Explorer 99 SE\Client99SE.exe WINEDEBUG=+loaddll
This is much shorter showing only the exception resulting from the call to AdvSch.dll and the subsequent stack dump & backtrace.
The sequence of events is the same as described above.

(Again apologies for pasting it here but only 1 attachment can be made as far as I can tell to this report.)

"WINE-18001","Mass Effect Xlib: unexpected async reply","Created attachment 20378
Patch for missing OpenGL locks in dlls/wined3d/context.c

When running Mass Effect 1.0 with Wine 1.1.18 on RHEL 5 and Core 2 Duo T7500 it frequently crashes with Xlib: unexpected async reply caused by multiple threads to access the same GLX surface. Enabling tracing for d3d shows that this happens at least in the vincinity of context_bind_fbo and
context_apply_attachment_filter_states (dlls/wined3d/context.c). These functions lack OpenGL locking via ENTER_GL()/LEAVE_GL().

Applying the attached patch apparently fixes the problem.",1492,"1"

crash with no dll overrides

La-Mulana will crash on startup due to incomplete dmusic support
If dmusic (and its related dlls) are set to override to native dlls but no native dlls are supplied the game will run but without music. Sound effects will work fine.
If native dlls are supplied for dmusic dmime dmsynth and dmband the music will work as well.(This produces a slew of fixmes from dmstyle and dmloader yet the builtin implementation of those two dlls are good enough for the music to work)
If no overrides are set the game will attempt to use the builtin implementation in wine and will crash.

The ONLY dll override necessary to make the game run without music(whether or not you supply a native dll) is WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dmime=n

with WINEDLLOVERRIDES left at  we get a crash:



Other crashes occur if of those 4 dlls listed above dmusic is left as builtin and the others all native or if dmusic is left native and all the rest builtin. The crash is slightly different if dmloader is native.

La-Mulana is freeware and can be obtained from http://lamulana.super-turbo.net/LA-MULANA.zip
The japanese to english translation patch inside that .zip file works fine in wine.


P.S. Somewhat unrelated: with the builtin implemnentation of dmband (and native dmusic dmime and dsynth all others builtin) the console messages indicate that it is certainly trying to play the music and is incrementing through the music files (which are directmusic .sgt files) but is unable to actually produce sound",1124,"1"

"WINE-13958","Services: handle null display names properly when populating SCM db entries","Hello

there is a bug in services code when one or more services have no display name set (null).
If CreateServiceW() is called it checks for existing services using 
scmdatabase_find_service_by_displayname().
Unfortunately this internal helper doesn't handle the null service name properly while iterating resulting in exception and messy side effects (although mapped to rpc exception it isn't propagated properly).

Following is service db dump with such cases:

If I change the values using regedit they are read by winedbg and wcmd but they 
seem to be ignored by both programs when creating the window. The only registry 
settings that seem to be used are those for the font settings. 
 
It concerns me that both winedbg and wcmd would share the same registry settings 
in the first place since they are totally different programs and in my mind 
should have setting that are independent to each other.

values are saved if you ask (from the right menu) to be be saved (otherwise they only 
change the 
current session) 
I know this is braindead but it's how MS interface is designed (I may change it) 
as of today registry values are stored only in wineconsole 
it may also evolves into a per application settings (defaulting to wineconsole's if none 
is present)

I am using the correct menu (I understand how it is supposed to work) but this

it is not saved.

"WINE-6153","Wine 0.9.20 breaks Everquest 2","Wine 0.9.19 allowed Everquest 2 to run as far as entering the 3d part of the
game (ie putting a character in the world) at which point there was a crash in
the EverQuest2.exe 

However it looks like 0.9.20 has broken this so that you cannot get that far.

When running normally  you get back ground music and about 3 full screen
images are displayed followed by a login prompt.  With 9.20 you only get a
black screen. (music still plays.)

Replacing the wined3d.dll.so with the 0.9.19 version allows it to work again so
it appears that something in the 0.9.20 build of this dll is causing the problem.

So far it appears the issue was not introduced by changes to directx.c or

fixme:font:WineEngRemoveFontResourceEx :stub

I noticed the error ever since I compiled and installed Wine 0.9.18. The same
problem exists in the 0.9.19 version. I get the same problems in Visual Fox Pro
6.0 itself. It manifests itself when I try to edit the code of an object like a
form grid etc. Instead of appearing the code window that is to appear remains
hidden but is available in the window list. The problem also affects other
windows in Fox. After I select a different window it appears and only after
doing that I can select the window that was to appear in the first place. I hope
that you will be able to recreate this bug and fix it. For me it is a very big
problem because I use Wine in a small company to run Visual Fox Pro software.
And I'm sure it is a problem for someone else. I hope you will look into it in
the next version.",84,"0"

"WINE-1406","16-BIT VB 3.0 APP -- NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR ENVIROMENT","Bug comments restored from Gmane.org:

I have been hoping to see this working with baseline WINE releases for about 2
years now. It's not a high priority but it's a curious problem. One particular
application I have errors out with a NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR ENVIRONMENT message
on startup. I do not have the source code for this application.

The application itself is a 16-bit VB 3.0 application used to access an online
database. The header indicates it's an MZ type executable and the imports show
it's based on VBRUN300. There's an NE marker in the header as well. Another
application with exactly the same header (but a different app nonetheless) works
just fine.

The WINE trace shows the following as the cause:

err:local:LOCAL_GetBlock not enough space in local heap 0dc7 for 140 bytes


Now all that said if I uncomment the FIXMEs int memory/local.c and prevent the
call from returning 0 in LOCAL_GetBlock it works fine (for a while at least).
So I guess the question is why are the FIXME's in that function still FIXME's
after all this time. I'm sure there is a reason for not uncommenting this code
but if anybody could shed light on this or get the FIXME's accepted it would be
really appreciated.


------- Additional Comments From marc_lavergne  yahoo.com  2003-04-22 21:40

I did some more digging it appears that the local heap is hitting the 64K
barrier on an attempt to grow it. The application actually fails in GrowHeap
around line 500 where the check to see if oldheap > 0xfff0 eval to true and a
FALSE gets returned. The error just bubbles up from the call to GrowHeap in
GetBlock. All the heap pointers and size values seem normal so it's really
running out of space. Fair enough so the question becomes WHY is the heap NOT
being exceeded in native Win98 but IS being exceeded in WINE. It only makes
sense that some cleanup of the heap happens under native Win that is not
happening under WINE. I'm a little at a loss from that point though. I assume a
heap walker like program would be helpful.

Probably we put things on the local heap that don't belong there.
Try to find out what items there take up the most space.


------- Additional Comments From marc_lavergne  yahoo.com  2003-04-23 07:26
-------
Makes sense. Can you recommend a program that will let me see calls to the local
heap under Win9x and I will try to track  it down. The error occurs early during
startup so accounting for the allocations by hand is a possibility. I'll compare
it to the calls I see under WINE and post back.

On another note there's a an application that starts with the problem VB
program auto-magically under Win98 WSASRV.EXE (Windows Sockets Asynchronous
Request Server). It appears it is being launched by one of the VBXs. This
program does not start with the working VB 3.0 16-bit prog. 

Also I took a look at the heap using HEAPWALK.EXE but it didn't show anything
of value besides a rough count of 1.8M for the total heap size when running
under Win98.

Since there's a workaround moving this to a normal severity. I haven't had a
chance to revisit it but I will get the heap alloc trace done shortly.
Workaround: modify LOCAL_GetBlock in memory/local.c to prevent arena==0 exits.
Not a permanent fix since it introduces an unhandled condition and is the wrong
way to do things anyhow.",782,"1"

The ChooseFont dialog when not using Unicode has an option to select which 
script will be used when the font supports more than one. This option is not 
implemented in WINE at the moment. 
 
In principle it shouldn't be too dificult to implement. All that needs to be 
done is adding a combo box to the dialog layout and filling it out with the 
result of GetFontUnicodeRanges. There is only really need to check for those 
ranges that correspond to the defined charsets (SYMBOL_CHARSET 
SHIFTJIS_CHARSET etc.). 
 
There is however some need to tweak the resources. For each of these charset 
you probably need: 
1. The demo text to use (locale independant). 
2. The display name to use (i.e. - SHIFTJIS_CHARSET is Japanese if the current 
locale is English RUSSIAN_CHARSET is Russian if the current locale is 
English etc.). 
 
It is my experience that under Windows 2000 ChooseFontW puts this combo box 
in but disables it (ugly).

foobar2000 crash handler log (alt-f)

Not-really-duplicate of Bug 7205 reported in 2007 and closed in 2008.

I'm using foobar2000 1.3.10. I first encountered this issue on Ubuntu 16.04 Cinnamon and Wine 1.6.2 x64 on a (I think) 32-bit wineprefix.

# Setup

* I also replicated this issue in Wine 1.9.10 32-bit (PlayOnLinux).
* To (hopefully) avoid foobar2000-specific tweaks I used [Install dialog] -> _Install a non-listed program_. Then I created a new app profile and 

# Instructions

* Install foobar2000 1.3.10.
* Open foobar2000. Press [Alt-F].

# Results

* foobar2000 crashes. The internal crash handler catches the crash and pops up a dialog.
* I clicked View Report and saved a crash log.
* Note that this bug is somewhat random. I've experienced GUI corruption Wine crash handler foobar2000 crash handler or no issues at all.

# Notes

* [Alt-Enter] crashes.

* [Alt] *focuses* the menu bar without crash. [Alt Enter] opens the File menu without crash.
    * Afterwards [Alt-F] etc. still crashes.

* Clicking on any menu opens that menu without crash.
    * Afterwards [Alt-F] etc. does NOT crash.
* Clicking the right-click menu keyboard key opens an undo/redo menu.
    * This also prevents crashes.",831,"1"

When you install the game and try to run it it will not save your settings and will keep giving you errors about not being able to save your settings and to check your permissions. Linux ownerships/write setting are fine so Wine seems to be creating a bug somewhere along the lines.

last 100 lines of +relay

Open the source code file eg.
/usr/src/wine-1.2-rc6/dlls/user32/winproc.c
Open the File Navigator window with Ctrl-F9 (left side pane)
Try double-clicking a function name in this pane.
You get:
Access violation at address 00559FCA in module 'EditPadPro.exe'. Read of address 00000018.
After closing this message you can go on. The function we called positions the editor at the right place and places focus in the right pane. It works as expected. The only thing is this message.

This may be connected with windows switching / activating / deactivating as it is a 2 pane app.

Prerequisites:
After installing the demo app http://download.jgsoft.com/editpad/SetupEditPadProDemo.exe follow the guidelines from AppDb http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20710 to properly configure it for wine. Just 2 simple steps.

Additional info:
The same result as double-clicking can be achieved by clicking once and following it with the enter key. This does not cause any problems.
Trying to locate the same function name many times doesn't bring the access violation banner any more. 
It appears only when you try to follow a new function. After that the function is freed from the annoying message box.

I contacted Jan Goyvaerts the author of the app. He is familiar with wine and he says this is a wine bug.

What else can I provide to make it solved? Brothers programmers this editor is a powerful crossplatform tool for editing code. It's worth investigating some time.

Title screen of Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor

This bug prevents Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor from being playable.

From my AppDB report:

What works
Game seems to start smoething that looks like a failed attempt at displaying the title screen shows. Mouse seems to work Alt+F4 to quit works. 

What does not
Display is completely broken. Everything is squeezed into the bottom-right triangular half of the screen and the squeeze is perspective correct so to say. It looks like a projective transformation of the original screen rectangle into a degenerate quadrilateral with left edge collapsed at the bottom left corner. That hints strongly at a borked projection matrix somewhere. 

The problem started occuring probably somewhere during the 1.2 release candidate phase and is still present as of 1.3.5.

Please improve AppDB so that it confirms test data being saved and added for review queue! Transition page with saved click to continue email with copy of report or web2.0-ish yellow javascript baloon is needed to make submitting data less confusing.

Crystal Key 2 (The Far Realm) is an adventure game developed by Kheops Studio in 2004.

The game shows a black screen on startup for a second or two then it crashes (instead of showing the company logos).

Workaround: screen resolution must be set to 800x600 before launching the game (that's the game's own resolution) or setting a virtual desktop sized to 800x600.

No demo available.

The problem is that Clang supports CFI but the version of GNU as shipped with OS X does not. When configure checks for CFI support it uses Clang and marks it as supported this means that later on -fasynchronous-unwind-tables is passed to winegcc and then to winebuild which generates the CFI lines and tries to assemble using /usr/bin/as which rejects them.

The problem can be solved by using clang -c as an assembler instead of as when the C compiler in use is Clang and not GCC. I verified that this fix works using a quick and dirty patch to winebuild but it needs to be properly conditionalized.",359,"0"

Installing Cisco Security Manager (CSM) 4.2 on ubuntu 64bit fails but when installing it in 32bit ubuntu it installs and runs fine.

I followed the directions to install the replacement advpack.dll and update it in the wine libraries as well as installing java in the wine environment prior to installing CSM.

available at:
http://sdg.ocs.ou.edu/builds/final/win/WeatherScope/WeatherScope-1.3.exe)
It's becoming quite usable but there is an issue with the mouse I'm trying to
shake out.  In the program when you right click on an object and bring up a
context menu after selecting an item from the menu the object behaves as
though you are holding the left mouse button and dragging the object around. 
This is especially annoying if you select the properties item from the menu.
This pops up a dialog box but you can't interact with the dialog box because
the object still essentially has control of the mouse.  Double clicking the
object which also brings up the properties box does not produce this
problematic behavior.

Looking at a +msg +message log it looks like X sends a right button up
message but this message is never dispatched.  I'm guessing this is because a
popup menu is engaged.  My guess is that since the button up is never sent the
program thinks the user is dragging the object.  If I knew where to look it in
the Wine source I'd try to see why the message isn't dispatched.  At any rate
this behavior is not observed on Windows.",3663,"1"

plain terminal output

The game becomes unresponsive when sounds are enabled and Alsa is set to full hw. acceleration (default).
The easiest way to reproduce the issue in the demo by choosing  from the main menu then click on . Another occurrence of the problem is when you try to create a new game: the game hangs after you've entered the name of your ship and commander.

Workaround: Alsa with 'emulation' mode.

Note #1 (when testing): in-game music must be disabled otherwise the game hits bug #2748.
Note #2: if you encounter mostly black screen after starting the game you need to change ORM to backbuffer.

To reproduce the problem in the demo:
1) Install the demo as usual.
2) Launch the demo by StarFury.exe the first time: this will create the corresponding registry entry for the game. Quit the launcher and fire up regedit. Look for the key under HKCU/Software/Malfador Machinations/Star Fury. Change the value of 'Play Music' from true to false.
3) Launch the demo again (now with disabled music). In the main menu select . When you've seen enough of it click on : the game will hang.

The problem didn't occur in Wine-1.3.16:

--- snip ---

The reason of the crash is that msxml3 doesn't check the node set for NULL (xpath query result) before looking at count of nodes.

This->result->nodesetval->nodeNr 

Such code is dangerous.
The NULL check of 'This->result' isn't enough because the node set can be NULL too.
All occurrences should be replaced by 'safe' libxml2 macros.

Max Payne 2 uses a lot of full-screen single-colour blending effects that
usually fade in and/or out. In Wine these effects are rendered as full opacity
making it impossible to see if you're getting shot.

During Part 3 Prologue there is a point where the screen is blended with a dark
red at low opactiy. This effect does not go away until you get to a certain
point (where it MAY change to a differend blend). It is impossible to see where
you are going and thus the game is rendered unplayable. Fortunately you can
still escape to the menu.

It's odd in that if I play the game after the bad commit it seems to have small bursts of working fine and running smoothly then starts lagging out / chugging along again shortly. With 1.3.18 however it works fine continuously. I ran a regression test and found the culprit. The bad commit description suggests drivers over 270.xx should be fine but it isn't the case for this particular game for me. Other games suffer no such problems.

    wined3d: Give GL_ARB_map_buffer_range another try.
    
    Nvidia's 270.xx.yy driver series fix the glMapBuffer alignment issues that caused major
    performance problems. If the user is using an older driver we now drop the VBO instead of using
    doublebuffered loading which means that we fall back to the current behavior(no dynamic VBO) as
    needed. Dynamic VBOs are needed on Nvidia drivers for GL_ARB_instanced_arrays.

    gdi32: Fix palette of 1bpp DIB in GetDIBits.

    Windows always generates a black/white palette for 1 bit DIBs
    generated from DDBs. Copying from the current palette only takes place
    for color DDBs (not explicitly mentioned in MSDN) and only if depth
    equal (MSDN states it explicitly).

    gdi32: Use supplied hdc for DIB_RGB_COLORS if it's valid.
    
    This is about fixing regression introduced with 2854884a428e222cbb9078d875068a72f25365c4.
    Initial patch fixed MSVS 2005 toolbars blackness this one doesn't break a fix
    and fixes regressed Animation control glitches (and probably reported games related problems).

I could revert the patch cleanly on Wine-1.3.15 and that fixed the problem (although text is missing again on the buttons with the reverted patch)

That's where snapshots can be useful: take a snapshot for each configuration we need to test and then let the TestBot start the VM from the right snapshot.

There is a catch though: while it's possible to run the tests in two VMs in parallel for a given VM only one snapshot can be active at a time. There's two consequences:
* TestBot must know about snapshot and not try to simultaneously run the tests in two snapshots belonging to the same VM.
* If in the base configurations (those all Wine patches run on) we have a VM with ten snapshots it means we will need to run the tests ten times *sequentially*. That VM is quickly going to become a bottleneck. So we should still limit the number of snapshots per VM at least in the base configurations.",1991,"1"

You need to rename/remove intro.avi from the installed game when testing because it causes an early crash.

When installing Commandos - Behind Enemy Lines I do not see any start menu entries in my Ubuntu (gnome) menu of wine.

I'm sure on windows both folders are merged and displayed together.

As I move the mouse across the user interface in Steam client or activate a menu item or scrolling through the installed games' list in the library text in the user interface periodically disappears and reappears.
Also can be reproduced in the login window: as I begin typing in the input fields text disappears then reappears.

Disabling dwrite.dll or launching Steam with 'no-dwrite' parameter is a workaround.
Reproduced in fullscreen and virtual desktop mode and with running Steam in Windows XP and Windows 7 modes.

This is mentioned further down in winedbg(1) but it would be so much clearer if the man page the info process command and other documentation consistently used wpid as  http://www.winehq.org/docs/winedev-guide/debugger does.

When doing a clean cvs install for a Mandrake 9.0 PC without windows

/usr/src/wine.  The messages I get are:

I saw a few people mention this problem and even a fix in the patches mailing

if these people thought it might be appropriate for a bug report.

After going through /usr/src/wine and verifying that there is no problem because 
of a cd command /usr/src/wine/programs/regedit/regedit was checked to see there 
is something wrong with the launch of wine.   
 
Apparently a number of activities have taken place to make wine launchable from 
within the source directories. The following message suggests that launching 
from /usr/src/wine near the end of the script 
/usr/src/wine/programs/regedit/regedit is not being properly handled:   
 
        Warning: could not find wine config [Drive x] entry for current working          
directory /usr/src/wine starting in windows directory. 
 
Is the intention to launch wine from /usr/src/wine without changing dierctory to 
the windows directory? 
 
Then this message appears: 
 
        /usr/src/wine/miscemu/wine: cannot find 'programs/regedit/regedit.exe.so' 
 
/usr/src/wine/programs/regedit/regedit.exe.so does indeed exist.  Is there a 
broken link that is missing here? 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From johane  lysator.liu.se  2002-11-12 04:20 ------- 
Increasing severity since registry install is not possible for the normal user 
right now. 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From marcus  jet.franken.de  2002-11-12 04:34 ------- 
This is in fact a configuration problem. You need to have /usr/lib/wine somewhere in 
your WINE drive 
list or regedit.exe will not be found. Just assign Drive Z to / or similar. 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From tony_lambregts  telusplanet.net 2002-11-12 
13:47 ------- 
I am pretty sure that this is not the right way setting drive Z to / is 
potentionaly dangerous. Also regedit(no extention) is installed to 
/usr/local/bin. In fact all the unix executables i.e notepad progman 
winemine... are installed there too. So perhaps it would be better if  the 
following was in the default config. 
 
 
[Drive Z] 
Path = /usr/local/bin 
Type = hd 
Filesystem = win95 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From julliard  winehq.com  2002-11-12 14:40 ------- 
You should not have to list the bin directory in your drive config and 
wineinstall should be able to run regedit in any case. This is a real bug 
please reopen it.

When JavaScript is disabled (which I have set as a default) the Bugzilla and Forums buttons are no longer accessible due to the search bar overlapping them.

Even without JavaScript it shouldn't be too hard to better position the search box (which is less valuable than the Bugzilla and Forums links it is hiding).

As a worst-case scenario if changing the positioning for some reason is not possible the z-index should likely be adjusted so the search goes underneath the buttons.",0,"0"

causes the complete screen to be upside down as soon as the game is entered but not while in the menus.  The position of the picture in picture rectangle mentioned in that other bug is still at the bottom left and its content is correct (hence you could play the game looking solely at the tiny picture...).

Wait text at the bottom and the score and icons at the top are drawn correctly so it's not the entire screen that's upside down it's only the 3D part (i.e. almost everything).

Curiously hitting the esc key to access the on-screen menu redraws the screen normally. (Perhaps the app takes a screenshot and draws the menu in that bitmap?). Resume the game and the scene is upside down again.

In newer versions checked during regression testing the situation was a little different: the screen would sometimes flip at certain camera positions but be upside down most of the time. In 1.3.18 it's constantly upside down.

Test project (VS2005) of a simple RPC client/server to repro the problem

Rpc clients that specify variables or the return value as a comm_status or fault_status variable normally do not guard their RPC call with a SEH try-except clause. After all using comm_status or fault_status variables is usually done because with these variables  SEH try-except can be omitted as any exception from the client side or server side part of the call is transformed into an error value that is assigned to the comm or fault status variable. However the current implementation of NdrClientCall2 unconditionally raises exceptions which an RPC client using comm_status and fault_status variables is not prepared or expected to handle. As a result such RPC clients crash immediately if any error occurs during the course of an RPC call. Find attached a VS2005 project of a simple RPC client and server that can call a variety of RPCs with different comm and fault status behaviour on client and server side that can be used to reproduce the problem.

     server: Store a mapping instead of a file for process dlls.

     server: Fix sharing parameters for debug event files and don't fail if the file can't be opened.

this causes a crash in wineserver if programs are executed in the Borland Delphi debugger. This is because the hFile object returned in the debugging event refers to duplicate (again created by dup_fd_object) of mapping->fd. Borland Delphi then tries to use SetFilePointer() and ReadFile() on that object and at that time wineserver dereferences the NULL fd_ops in the fd object and crashes.",0,"0"
