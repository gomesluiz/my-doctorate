Hi

I think this bug will only concerns the french localization of Camino because. In the seach bar (top right corner) theire is a possibility of searching in Le Jargon FR.

Unfortunatly Le Jargon FR have changed its URL. It was http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/ and it moved to http://jargonf.discu.org/ .

In order to allow searchin in the new website the search code sould be changed from:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/general/cherche.php?req=
to
http://jargonf.discu.org/index.php/Special:Search?search=

Fortunatly the new website works with Wikimedia so it should looks like Wikipedia search.


Reproducible: Always

1.Select Le Jargon FR in search bar

"CORE-15405",":root element stretches vertically to fit viewport [BG] (grows)","The root element is stretching to fit the viewport if its contents are smaller
than the height of the viewport. It should not.

According to CSS2 section 9.1.2:
# The height of the initial containing block may be specified with the
# 'height' property for the root element. If this property has the value
# 'auto' the containing block height will grow to accommodate the document's
# content.

The initial value is 'auto' and so the height of the root element should
shrinkwrap the contents. Currently we are using the maximum of either the
content height or the viewport height.

Another problem may have to do something with this problem too. After loading a

save these pictures to disk. After I tried to save the second picture Mozilla

Build Identifier: Trunk

Add SSE2 optimization for ycc_rgb_convert and turn five dynamic tables into static tables. ycc_rgb_convert is a common color conversion and using SSE2 code instead of scalar code results in about a 25% performance improvement in my testing.

There are four tables that are generated in the jdcolor.c module every time an image is processed. The change here uses a static table instead of going through malloc computation and free each time.

There is a table called range_limit that's created for every image and this is done in jdmaster.c. The change here changes that to a static table instead of creating it for every image.

The SSE2 code and the table code are only varianted on Win32 builds built with MSVC. The SSE2 code will only run on processors that support it but that should be most processors in the last six years.

This code piggybacks on the HAVE_SSE2_INTEL_MNEMONICS define variable and the SSE2Available global that's in the existing SSE2 JPEG code for the Inverse Discrete Cosign Transform.

155484 and friends but I'm not positive and don't have old builds around atm to
check.  It's definitely a regression fromn 0.8.4 where at least a bookmark got

1) chameleon is technically a development box.  The hardware isn't quite up to our production standards (lack of redundancy etc).  lists.spreadfirefox.com wound up running on it one of those times a long time ago when SpreadFirefox got hacked and it was the quickest place to move it at the time to get it up and running again the most quickly.  It was only supposed to be a temporary move and it never got moved elsewhere.  lists.spreadfirefox.com is the only production service running on this box.

2) We get a lot of spam on the abuse/postmaster/webmaster addresses on the spreadfirefox-related domain names because chameleon doesn't have very good spam filtering set up.  By moving these domains into the San Jose colo we can put them behind our primary mail relays which have very beefed up and actively-maintained spam and virus protection.

I don't know if there are any mailing lists on lists.spreadfirefox.com which are actively used so I'll need input from SpreadFirefox folks as to whether this needs to have a major outage window scheduled and announcements made or if I can just do it (mail will be queued and eventually deliver you'll basically just lose the Mailman web interface for the duration of the move).",25,"0"

15.1.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers

   Accept request-headers can reveal information about the user to all
   servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header in particular
   can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private
   nature because the understanding of particular languages is often
   strongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.

   An approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent
   to omit the sending of Accept-Language headers by default and to ask
   the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language headers to a
   server if it detects by looking for any Vary response-header fields
   generated by the server that such sending could improve the quality
   of service.

   Elaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request
   in particular if these include quality values can be used by servers
   as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user
   identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking
   and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server
   click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for
   many users not behind a proxy the network address of the host
   running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user
   identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance
   privacy user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept
   header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy
   measure proxies could filter the accept headers in relayed requests.
   General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header
   configurability SHOULD warn users about the loss of privacy which can
   be involved.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050803 Firefox/1.0+

A few months ago the Netlock Class QA root certificate was submitted to add it to the certificate repository.

But there was some change in hungarian regulations and we should switch because these to the other root CA certificate profile (there was some predefined root CA certificate profile) to follow these regulations.

So the actually used root CA certificate has different extension follwing the regulations and we would like to ask you to change it.

(previous request is here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279728 )
(maybe open bugs are closable regarding our previous request because the extensions which cause bugs are not critical now.)
(this problem was reported to the RFC maintainer qcStatement should be not critical)

The new Netlock Class QA certificate is the following.
(Purposes are the same.)

I think we should round CSS border widths to the nearest device pixel in the
style system so that a given border width always rounds to the same size.  The
idea here is that we're solving this problem only for borders and not for
anything else -- since:
 1) for things like widths we want to ensure that 4 * 25% is 100% not a few
pixels less and
 2) we don't want consistency of heights for things handled by (1) since that
creates gaps like in bug 173051.

- move everything into sample.config
- normalize all paths in sample.config to be workable across platforms (ie a path of 'pageloader/chrome' will be correctly interpreted as 'pageloader\chrome' on windows)
- to handle the different counter options under different platforms created win_counters and unix_counters which are correctly used depending on the system
- add a --debug option and get that out of the config file

So as long as things are installed in the 'standard' locations you should be able to run talos across win/mac/linux using the same sample.config.  The only change that you should have to make is the name of firefox (as it will be firefox.exe on windows and firefox on unix style systems).

If Automatically check for updates to: is enabled for Deer Parc (Firefox)
and Installed Extensions and Themes you get a notification if updates to Deer
Parc are found but you DONT get notified for any update found for an Extension. 
The only way to see if there is an Extension-update available is to manually
open the EM scroll through all the Extensions and look out for the Update Now
Button behind each Extension.
Since Extension-updates will never be applied automatically and most
unexperienced Users will not look regularly into EM auto-check gets pretty
useless and most Users will be stuck with old Extensions.
This could be an potential security-risk with old unsafe Extensions (aka
Greasemonkey) not beeing updated. Therefore setting Severity to Major (and a

normal.

> Jim: you want to do it? I was going to do it as parasympathetic nervous system
> therapy some night but it's fair game for anyone.

Sure --- I've promised strict mode and breakpad CFI at the moment but once those are in the clear this would be satisfying to do.  But it's filed as a bug now so anyone with gumption should grab it.

---

The bigger cleanup I kept refraining from doing in the upvar2 work to keep the
patch only insanely big instead of super-insanely big is to get rid of almost
all the parameters to jsparse.cpp functions making most of them methods of
JSCompiler. This should speed up the recursive-descent parser.

Beyond this there are some cleanups to jsscan.h to use C++ canonical style. But
again the JSCompiler wants at least some inline helpers to forward calls on
itself to its tokenStream member to save typing and shorten lines full of
redundancy in jsparse.cpp.

---

To say a bit more all the C static functions that have the JSParser signature:

typedef JSParseNode *
JSParser(JSContext *cx JSTokenStream *ts JSTreeContext *tc)

become JSCompiler methods taking zero args. Any cx uses become free and need to
rename to context -- or better we rename JSCompiler::context -> cx. Similarly
for ts -> &tokenStream mutatis mutandis. The tc param needs to be a top of
tree context stack pointer in JSCompiler but that's easy to do too.

Hope this helps and actually wins. Zero params has to make a difference on
code perf as well as size even if we sometimes load this->cx or whatever. But
a second opinion is welcome.",198,"1"

"CORE-525411","lirasm: fix CallInfo problems","Created attachment 409288
patch

The handling of calls in lirasm is currently screwy.  In particular we
infer the CallInfo details of a function entirely from the call site.  But
we currently get the arg types wrong in some cases on X64.  This patch fixes
this. 

Furthermore for built-in functions inferring isn't a good idea we should
check the call site details against the existing CallInfo details instead.
So the patch does that as well.  This will catch some asm code errors.

Also calling blocks by their address (eg. call 0x1234 fastcall) seems 
like a terrible idea and isn't currently used AFAICT.  So I removed this
functionality. 

As a result of this patch a couple of the lirasm tests that previously 
asserted on X64 now pass.",7,"0"

"CORE-527147","flat lambdas' parents differ between recording and trace","In the following code:

function g() {
    var x = 1
    var result = abcd.replace('b' function(){return x})
}
for (var i = 0 i < 100 ++i) {
    g()
}

The parent of |function(){return x}| differs between when we are interpreting/recording and executing on trace.  This can be observed by putting a breakpoint in jsstr.cpp FindReplaceLength on the line:

        *sp++ = OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(OBJ_GET_PARENT(cx lambda))

For the first three executions the parent is the global object for the fourth (on trace) the parent's class is a js_FunctionClass.  This causes a problem for tracing String.replace with a lambda since the trace type of a function differs from other objects.

The root of the discrepancy is in TraceRecorder::record_JSOP_LAMBDA_FC which effectively passes cx->fp->argv[-2] (the caller object) to js_AllocFlatClosure as the parent.  In the interpreter cx->fp->scopeChain is passed which is the global object for the above code.

I read that scopeChain can be lazily initialized so perhaps in some situations the caller object would in fact be the parent of a new lambda.  Is this possible?  If so then the generated code would be technically correct.

Even if this behavior is allowed though it would be nice (for avoiding an always-wasted recording) if the trace type of a function's parent did not change from record-time to trace execution-time.  Is there any simple efficient way to produce the same parent as when interpreting?",13,"0"

"CORE-292890","Investigate interaction of bfcache/fastback and midas","At least two possible issues here:

First the editing session is torn down on progress listener notifications and
fastback doesn't restore it.  

So with fastback if a site sets designMode on a document in a frame then the
frame is navigated to another URL and then the user goes back we will have:

1)  No editor hooked up in the frame.
2)  The document thinking an editor is hooked up.

At this point there is no way to reenable designMode for that document due to
item 2 even if the site uses the DOMPageRestore event to do so.

Second editing session teardown messes with things like image animation modes
script enabling etc etc on the document we're leaving.  If fastback also
messes with them we need to ensure the two run in the right order.

Simplest solution (and possibly most correct) may be to disable presentation

After trying to edit an event I'm stuck with some windows about confirming your attendance to the event while I was actually expecting the usual edit dialog.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double click on any item in the calendar or right click and choose Open
2.Try to edit the item details.

Actual Results:  
When double clicking or choosing Open from the context menu instead of being able to edit the event details I'm getting a window to confirm all attendees to this event. For most events only my own name / e-mail is listed but I can in no way get to edit the actual event details. Not happening to every item but sure does to a lot of them!

Expected Results:  
I was expecting the usual event dialog with all event info filled in to be editted.

"CORE-395397","Process Gecko events on demand in Cocoa widgets","Created attachment 280078
Process Gecko events on demand using a CFRunLoopSource

At present Minefield processes Gecko events in a tight loop (repeated
calls to NS_ProcessNextEvent() in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) on the main
thread.  But this tight loop can be interrupted by modal activity (a
nested event loop that temporarily does its own event processing).
And unless the nested event loop also processes Gecko events Gecko
events will (temporarily) stop being processed.

Some of these nested event loops belong to the browser so they
(presumably) can take responsibility for processing Gecko events as
needed.  But others belong to the OS which knows nothing of Gecko
events.  Examples are native menus and context menus (only Camino
uses native context menus) plus the modal loop that runs while
someone is using a window's resize region (in the lower-right
corner) to resize it.  While these native event loops are running
no Gecko events are processed.  (For more information see bug 356720.)

The current nsAppShell.mm contains code (in ProcessGeckoEvents() and
ScheduleNativeEventCallback()) that's supposed to get around this
problem by also processing Gecko events on demand (triggered from
nsBaseAppShell::OnDispatchedEvent()).  But (for obscure timing
reasons about which more below) this code currently never processes
any Gecko events if we're also processing Gecko events in a tight loop
(in nsBaseAppShell::Run()).

My patch fixes this problem by no longer processing Gecko events in a
tight loop -- it _only_ processes Gecko events on demand.  As a
result Gecko events get processed even during native modal event
loops (and bug 356720 stops happening).

Several other changes were needed to make processing Gecko events only
on demand via a CFRunLoopSource work properly -- they're noted in the
patch's comments.

Camino currently only processes Gecko events on demand (it doesn't
call nsAppShell::Run() and doesn't process them in a tight loop).
But it uses a different method to schedule those events (not a
CFRunLoopSource) which still allows the processing of Gecko events to
stop during native modal event loops.  My patch's method fixes this
problem.

In principle it'd be nice to be able to process Gecko events on
demand _and also_ in a tight loop.  But that would require changes to
cross-platform widget code (in nsBaseAppShell.cpp particularly in
NativeEventCallback() and DoProcessNextNativeEvent()).

As far as I can tell my patch doesn't cause any event starvation
(Gecko or native).

Note (quoting from a comment in my patch):

nsBaseAppShell::NativeEventCallback() doesn't actually process any
Gecko events if elsewhere we're also processing Gecko events in a
tight loop (as happens in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) -- in that case
ProcessGeckoEvents() is always called while ProcessNextNativeEvent()
is running (called from nsBaseAppShell::OnProcessNextEvent()) and
mProcessingNextNativeEvent is always true (which makes
NativeEventCallback() take an early out).",12,"0"

I then used simpler and simpler plans eventually submitting without adding anything (but still opening the edit window) and got the same error.  I then realized that when the edit window opened my cursor was in fact not all the way to the left -- if I backspaced and then submitted things were fine.  poking around a bit I discovered that the character is 0xa0 a non-breaking space and this has caused similar problems with XML parsers and suchlike.  

oddly enough this error does not occur when creating a test plan from scratch even though I see similar behavior with there being a space in the test plan document editing window when I open it (i.e. I can backspace to remove a character).

mozilla.org's template but that's not necessary.  It should add a reasonable

Since preview will echo scripts back to the user security precautions are
necessary.  Otherwise another site could submit a page to preview with a
script that tries to read the user's stored CVS password.  (Compare bug 38862
for Bugzilla).

Possible security tricks:

1. Check the referer for a submit to preview.cgi and make sure it's doctor.cgi.  
This would lock out users who have disabled all referers (rather than only
cross-site referers) would not work for Beonex users who chose to use fake
referers (evil!) and I think it would break the HTTP spec.

2. Strip out script tags and event handlers.  
Not a good idea: this is hard to implement even harder to get right with the
huge number of event handlers and not forward-compatible with new versions of
IE with new event handlers.

3. Use a different hostname for preview.  Require that preview be done with
doctor-preview.mozilla.org rather than doctor.mozilla.org and require that all
other scripts be done with doctor.mozilla.org.  Make Doctor verify that the main
hostname (doctor.mozilla.org) and the preview hostname
(doctor-preview.mozilla.org) are neither identical and that neither is a
substring of the other.

ValidRolloverfromPrintableStringtoUTF8StringTest10EE.crt has a

The commonName in question is:

Valid Rollover from PrintableString to UTF8String EE Certificate Test10 

NSS fails this test in two different ways.  This bug report is about one
of those failures.

NSS is unable to print the subject name of that cert because of the length
of the commonName attribute.  

RFC 3280 defines upper bounds for the lengths of the various attribute 
types in a Name.  The bound for a commonName attribute is 64 characters.  

NSS enforces that limit in CERT_CreateAVA and in CERT_NameToAscii.  
Both operations simply fail if any attribute's length exceeds its respective
upper bound.  If any attribute is too long CERT_NameToAscii returns NULL.
It doesn't return a string that contains any useful information about the
other attributes or about the attribute that was too long.  I think that's
bad.  

Some alternatives for CERT_NameToAscii are:

1. when an attribute is too long simply truncate it to the maximum length
and go on.

2. when an attribute is too long display Value Too Long instead of the 
actual value.

"CORE-443985","PageX/Y properties are incorrectly calculated when a event is manually dispatched (initmouseevent)","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

PageX/Y represent the horizontal/vertical coordinates of an event relative to the whole document.  This differs from clientX/clientY which are the horizontal/vertical coordinate within the application's client area.  When you scroll a document and then fire an event the pageY should be the clientY + scrolldata.

This works as expected in FF2 and it works in FF3 when clicking manually.  But when manually dispatching events in FF2 pageY would include scrolldata in FF3 pageY does not include scrolldata but ONLY when manually dispatching.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the attached page in FF3.  This page includes a 4000px spacer div followed by two buttons: report pageY and Simulate mouseup on the other button.  During onload a mouseup is automatically simulated.
Actual Results:  
You'll see the word FAIL in the body of the page because pageY is less than 4000.  If you manually click on report pageY you'll see the word PASS in the body of the page.  You may also manually click on the simulate mouseup button to get the word FAIL to appear again.  On my machine pageY is typically ~1000px.

Expected Results:  
The word PASS should appear in the body of the page regardless of whether you push the left button or the right button.  pageY should always be >4000.

This bug was discussed elsewhere in bug 411031 and bug 405632. This regression  caused a bug in Microsoft's Virtual Earth maps which depended on the behavior of pageY.

There is no public standard for the behavior of pageY but there is a defacto standard behavior: FF2 Safari 3.1 and Opera 9.5 all behave the same way (they all say PASS when you load up the page).  FF3 changed the behavior of this attribute incorrectly.",6,"0"

"MOZILLA_LOCALIZATIONS-521994","[hu] Choose search plug-ins for Fennec in Hungarian","You've indicated an interest in participating in the localization of mobile Firefox (aka Fennec). We want to ship Fennec with a good list of search engines for Hungarian. As the technical details of implementation are being worked on we'd like to start the discussion about the choice of search engines. This bug is about agreeing on a set of search engines and will not tackle the implementation (at least not yet).

First the localization team and Staś will look at the market for the locale and come up with a good set of search providers. The guidelines for making recommendations are on https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mobile/Productization. You're welcome to suggest engines already shipped in desktop Firefox for Hungarian if they fit well in the categories outlined on the wiki.

For en-US we currently use the following set which may serve as an inspiration:
Google Wikipedia Amazon Yahoo Twitter.

Note that according to the guidelines for some categories it may be better to leave them empty than to ship with en engine that's irrelevant or unavailable in your region.

After we decided on a particular search engine we will need to test it in Fennec. You can test on a mobile device and on the desktop (download the builds from ). Staś will help with testing on a device too. If the service works fine Staś will contact the owner and ask for permission and for specifics like proper search flags. $name we'll likely need your help to at least get the contact information if we don't have them already.

We don't know the implementation details yet so for now please don't create patches nor land anything. We will keep you posted as we figure out the how's and when's.

At http://www.mozbrowser.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5645 a bug in Firefox is mentioned. Someone browses to a webpage that does not exist anymore. Therefore the hosting provider (Lycos) redirects to their portal (www.jubii.dk).

I used the windowsupdate.com site to install a number of non-critical updates
(most of them for hardware such as WLAN card modem mouse touchpad etc.)
and I was prompted to restart the computer.  After the restart Firefox wouldn't start.  Each attempt at starting Firefox would lead the firefox.exe process to terminate almost immediately *without* causing a crash.  So unfortunately there are no talkback IDs to report.  Check out bug #355594 which is a similar problem on the same machine and at the same time happening with Thunderbird as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to start Firefox.
2. Watch nothing happening (because the process is silently terminating.)
3. Start Firefox in Safe Mode.
4. Disable the Talkback extension.
5. Close Firefox.
6. Start Firefox in normal mode.
7. Watch the browser open fine.
8. Enable the Talkback extension.
9. Restart Firefox.
10. Watch nothing happening (like before.)

I could go on and on with the same procedure.

all the merchandise in the category named by the caption.

a. make it so clicking on the image above other merchandise links to the other
merchandise listing not just the one product (and ditto for other categories).  Or

b. add name of each featured product such as firefox decal under each image

"CORE-528857","nanojit: mismanagement of name lifetimes with TMFLAGS=assembly?","I'm seeing some screwy behaviour with TMFLAGS=assembly.  Names get associated with instructions for the debug output.  AFAICT memory holding LIR is being recycled -- eg. different instructions in different fragments that are compiled at different times may end up at the same address in memory.  However the LirNameMap seems to be staying live across the compilation of these different fragments and so inappropriate names are being given to instructions in the second fragment.

I've attached some output that shows this.  First I turned off addName() which manually names some interesting instructions because it just confuses things.  'xt69' is the instruction name of interest.  It appears in a fragment on line 3881:

  0x9fc5d90: xt69: xt eq136 -> pc=0x9febb2f imacpc=(nil) sp+56 rp+0 (GuardID=094)

'xt69' is an appropriate name for a LIR_xt instruction.  'xt69' appears again a couple of fragments later:

  0x9fc5d90: xt69 = int 12

I added some code to print the address of LIR_xt and LIR_int instructions and you can see it's the same address ie. the memory has been recycled.  But the LirNameMap seemingly hasn't been recycled so 'xt69' is still associated with addres 0x9fc5d90 even thought the LIR instruction at that location has changed and we use it inappropriately.

Graydon you understand the allocator lifetimes... any idea what's going on here?  The LirNameMap is using 'alloc' as its allocator whereas the LirBuffer is using 'tempAlloc'.  I thought they should use the same one because the lifetime of a LIR fragment should match the lifetime of its LirNameMap.  So I tried changing LirNameMap to use 'tempAlloc' but I got crashes and Valgrind diagnoses bazillions of use-after-free errors.  Then I tried changing LirBuffer to use 'alloc' and the problem goes away but that extends the LirBuffer's lifetime inappropriately I think.",33,"0"

rule.
Mozilla 0.9.5 Redhat 7 rpm build fails to honor the style whether the margins
are proportional or absolute.
In the proportional case the rule is offset to the right as much as 200% of the
screen width. The rule itself is about a 100% wide. You have to scroll by a
large amount to see it.
In the absolute case Mozilla correctly takes into account the left margin but
fails to honor the right margin. The rule seems to have a 100% width so you have
 to scroll to the right by the width of the left margin to see its end.
This behaviour shows up in xhtml and html (loose DTD). I did not test other
documents type.
The margins show up as expected under Netscape 4.78 Amaya 5.1 Internet

Mozilla.

No.  Once an NSPR thread is create joinable or unjoinable
there is no way to change that attribute.  I'm not sure
whether that's an oversight or a conscious design decision.

Pthreads has the operation you want: pthread_detach.

It's not hard to work around this limitation.  You'd create
all your threads PR_UNJOINABLE_THREAD.  Then you use a
thread count and a condition variable to synchronize with
them when the thread pool gets destroyed like this:

void WorkerThread(void *arg)
{
    ....
    // need to exit either voluntarily or because the
    // thread pool is being destroyed.
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)
    if (--thread_count == 0) {
        PR_NotifyCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
}

void TheThreadThatDestroysTheThreadPool(void *arg)
{
    ...
    // signals all the threads in the pool to exit
    ...
    // synchronize with them
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)  // you might already be holding this
lock when you signal the threads to exit
    while (thread_count) {
        PR_WaitCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
    ....
}

I will take a look at your new thread pool code tonight.

Maybe Doug would be good enough to take this task on again and help me solve 
this problem. 

(BTW Doug If you look for the #if 0 in nsThread.cpp you'll see how I was

"CORE-38378","Style system should not reresolve for every attribute change","First some background as provided to me by the ever-helpful attinasi:

CSSFrameConstructor::AttributeChanged is called. This is were the
restyling happens. First the content object is asked what the impact of
the change is (given an attribute and a value). It can indicate a
RECONSTRUCTION a REFRAME or a simple VISUAL change.

For RECONSTRUCT the entire document is torn down and rebuilt. Pretty
harsh.

For a REFRAME a new frame is created for the affected content and
normal frame-construction / style resolution takes place.

For a VISUAL change we ask the FrameManager to compute the style change
impact. This walks up the frames getting the style contexts from them
and re-resolves the style on each one. ReResolve style runs through all
of the style rules for the content and any pseudo-style associated with
it and sets the new style values. As it goes it checks if the style
context actually changes and if it does it appends the new context to a
list of changes. It also keeps track of the kinds of changes that are
made indicating if there needs to be a reflow a reframe or just a
repaint. Depending on the results of the resolutions we then either
reconstruct the frames issue a reflow or update (paint) the views.

(End of attinasi missive.)

So this means that the _best_ case scenario for an attribute change is that we
walk every frame in the document and reresolve the style on each one.  Then we
decide what to do with it and in the best case again we do nothing (or issue a
paint I guess).

As an example of why I really want to fix this behaviour scrolling a GFX
scrollbar sets the ``curpos'' attribute lots.  Like lots and lots.

So I hacked up a patch which I will attach below.  It keeps a list on each
style sheet of each attribute that actually appears in a selector and then
checks against that table when an attribute changes.  Only if that attribute can
affect style context do we do the re-resolve dance.

With this patch I spit out a - for each style reresolution that I manage to

the reresolution or attribute that mattered).  I scrolled the checkin-rules
page down and then back up and got the following:

------------++++++++++--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------++-

So damn.  It looks like we can win pretty huge here.

But of course it's not quite that easy.  I'm apparently causing not _quite_
enough action in the layout engine at times because some needed updates aren't
happening.  As an example while the document scrolls the scroll thumb doesn't
move.  And image rollovers as found on my old nemesis http://www.honda.com/ 
don't work.

Maybe I need to fire a paint at the minimum.  Maybe I'm blocking reresolutions
too aggressively and need to be more careful that I only block the ones that
are directly from the AttributeChanged notification and not from other paths
through that code.  I'm not sure yet but I wanted to throw this out for people
to poke at while I ponder.

(I think the patch will build but some files did get touched lightly when I
updated before the diff and there are some other -- unrelated I think --
changes in my layout tree.  No warranty express or implied.)",13,"0"

1. Place the caret in a blank RTL input field or textarea
2. While the caret is visible (i.e. during the on half of the caret blink
cycle) type a single LTR (English) character.
3. The caret will appear to the left of the typed character instead of to its
right.
4. Deleting this character will now require two presses of backspace.

The same happens when typing a single RTL (Hebrew) character into a blank LTR

This does not happen if the character is typed while the caret is not visible

The greek version of Firefox has english question marks at the end of many of the greek sentences. This shows very unprofessional to new users of Firefox.

One such example is when you try to close a multi-tab Firefox window. You get asked whether you want to close all the open tabs and the question mark in that question is the english one.

The greek question mark looks like this  (just like an enlish semi-colon)

Looking in to this my best guess (I wish I could provide insight that was more certain than a guess...) is that following the call to .close() done in the pipe() method the errProcess stream gets cleaned up and its underlying file descriptor is destroyed thus this exception on this later (second) call to close().

If this call to errProcess.close() is commented out the same exception would occur but via the call to in.close() on line 744: (

  pipe(false in inProcess)
  in.close()

)

I suspect (though didn't actually encounter) this exception could also happen on line 769's call to outProcess.close().

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
run rhino runCommandBug.js where the file runCommandBug.js consists of:

var i = 0
while (true) {

    i += 1

    print(\nA -  + i)
    runCommand(ls -w 0)

    print(\nB -  + i)
    runCommand(ls -w 1)

}
Actual Results:  
IOException (Bad file descriptor) would occur around the 30th iteration of the loop. (Sometimes the exception would not occur until after several hundred iterations though.)

"NSS-301259","signtool Usage message is unhelpful","The signtool documentation that once existed on developer.netscape.com is 
now all gone.  All we have left is the Usage message in the tool itself
and that is very unhelpful.  The usage message cites non-existant URLs for
documentation and it gives examples that use otherwise undocumented options
as modifiers.  Today one cannot even determine the distinct operations that 
the tool can perform from the Usage message.  This needs urgent attention.

The Usage message needs to 
- document EVERY option known to signtool
- separate the command options (which specify the operation to be performed)
  from the modifier options that merely supply file names or info about 
  variants on how to perform the operation.
- document which options are required for each operation e.g. cert nickname
  is likely required for signing but not for JAR signature verification.

The usage message should not cite urls from netscape.com any longer.

After reading the usage message the reader should easily be able to 
- list the operations that the tool can perform
- know which options are required for each of those operations.  

The existing usage message states that every command requires a positional
parameter which is a directory-tree but the -v and -w commands take an
an argument that is a jar file name not a directory tree name.  So that
usage summary is wrong.  

If there are any commands that can operate from EITHER a jar file or a 
directory tree (or both) as input this needs to be documented in the usage
somehow along with how to specify one or the other and which is default.  

Likewise for output.  Some commands produce a JAR file as output.  They
may also leave a (modified) directory tree as output.  The production of 
the output JAR file may be optional.  The Usage needs to make this clear. 

Finally I will add that after reading the usage the reader should be able
to answer the question of which command cause any JAR file contents to be 
uncompressed and extracted.",840,"1"

Build Identifier: 

nss_ckmdSessionObject_SetAttribute in security/nss/lib/ckfw/sessobj.c has an allocation which it does not scale by the size of the element type leading to a write overflow.  The relevant code is pasted below.

I don't know whether this is exploitable (I don't have much familiarity with the Firefox or NSS code and this was found with a code scanning tool).

BEGIN_CODE

  nssCKMDSessionObject *obj
...
  CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PTR rt

  rt = (CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_PTR)nss_ZRealloc(obj->types (obj->n + 1))

  }

  obj->attributes = ra
  obj->types = rt
  obj->attributes[obj->n] = n
  obj->types[obj->n] = attribute
  obj->n++

END CODE

The call to nss_ZRealloc allocates obj->n+1 bytes instead of (obj->n+1)*sizeof(CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE) bytes (CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE is an unsigned long) so the write to obj->types[obj->n] will overflow as well as future reads and writes of obj->types.

After restarting the folder appears again but when I try to delete it nothing
happens and if I look in my profile directory the folder is represented in
/Mail/Local Folders/ by an empty directory rather than an mbox file.

The problem doesn't occur if I delete the folder and then attempt to recreate it
without restarting.  It's as if the deletion isn't getting written to the
datastore (panacea.dat?) so all record of the deletion is lost once the app is
shut down causing the app to think the folder still exists upon restart which
causes the mbox file to get created incorrectly when requested.

Subject: Rhino performance tip (FAQ recommendation)
Date: Fri 28 Feb 2003 10:20:34 -0800
From: Steven Beal 
To: Igor Bukanov (E-mail) 

Igor

I was experiencing poor performance on the IBM virtual
machine (the one shipped with Websphere) and eventually
traced the problem to excessive throwing and catching
of exceptions.  

The Sun VM  handles exceptions much more efficiently
and thus does not suffer quite so much from exceptions
being thrown and caught in quick succession which is
why I didn't notice the issue before.

This is not a bug in rhino in fact the condition is
produced by a workaround for a Sun java bug

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4071593.html

See org.mozilla.javascript.NativeJavaMethod.retryIllegalAccessInvoke().

The pattern used here is the same as that shown in one of the
annotations of the currently open incarnation of the same bug

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4071957.html

This bug is not limited to inner classes though.  It
will also manifest itself why trying to invoke via reflection
a method on a pkg. private class offered via an Interface.

I place several references into the local scope created for
a request that are interface references to pkg. private classes
created via an Abstract Factory pattern.  By making these
classes public I avoided the need for the bug workaround and
improved performance significantly (a necessary compromise).

Perhaps some mention of this should be made in the FAQ since the
performance impact is significant (extremely so on the IBM VM).
The same problem would be seen when using Dynamic Proxies 
and features of the Collection classes.  If you read through
the associated bug reports I'm sure you will find more cases.

In IRC and newsgroup discussions we seemed to get to an agreement that the best solution for the future is to go with leaving the core ChatZilla bundling en-US and have language packs for other locales which are marked dependent on the main ChatZilla package for those applications that can deal with extension dependency.
We also should get AMO to support such extension language packs and even offer compound ChatZilla+locale packages as so-called Multiple Item Packages for apps based on toolkit 1.8 and higher.

The target is to get a solution with this for SeaMonkey 2.0 locale repackaging and as a second goal also create XPIs that can be used for Add-On installation on all apps that ChatZilla supports. I'll try to work on those goals in this order.

Applying the techniques described in Eric Meyer's Pure CSS Menus css/edge
page I wrote a small test page that includes a number of menus containing
submenus in varying directions. When mousing over the toplevel menus (direct
children of the containing  elements) the menu is displayed but the
surrounding area is temporarily garbled. 

For second and deeper level nested menus there is no apparent rending problem.

I'm not sure of the validity or acceptability of my CSS code but it works for
Eric and I'd much prefer it if it worked for me too...

It seems to display correctly in Safari on OS X. (I lose the opacity but that's
another problem - for some reason on my Debian copy of Firebird 0.6.1 the
opacity property causes that item to disappear. I don't think the opacity
property is causing this effect.) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move mouse over FOO in bottom left corner. Observe rendering problem
particularly at bottom of page.
2. Move mouse up menu to MORE. Once again observe rendering problem
3. Move mouse across and up to GAR. Observe lack of rendering problem.

* paste in an address by middle-clicking on the window
* click on a link
* go back (especially when doing google searches)
* reload (especially for nicknamed or bookmarked pages)
* copy address and paste into another app

All of these should have keyboard shortcuts. And they do. 

But back and reload are very simple actions that should have single key shortcuts. 

Currently on Unix the shortcuts are awkward to find with the fingers: Alt-Left
and Ctrl-R. 

They should be the same as on Windows: Backspace and F5. If that's not possible
other keys should be found so that only a single easy-to-find-with-the-fingers
key needs to be pressed for these extremely common actions.

The changes in bug #123030 has the doOnSelectProduct() function called in
form.html.tmpl and defined in search-advanced.html.tmpl.

However that breaks report tables/graphs because both search-report-table.html

For perfect OS integration on Linux/GNOME it would be very nice if we could create a theme that always picks up the icons from the GTK icon theme.

This is possible today by using moz-icon://stock/*. The only problem so far is that I am unable to create the disabled state of buttons because there is no way to display a button in grayscale and XUL doesn't seem to do this itself (when the button is disabled).

Now creating separate icons for disabled stats would be possible but it also defeats the whole purpose of this. So would it be possible to provide a -moz-disabled property similar to -moz-opacity which draws the icon with less saturation to make it look gray/disabled?

Build Identifier: 1.2

If a test case is associated to more than one component it will be returned multiple times when filtering by more than one of those components. For instance assume we have three components (C1 C3 and C3). Now let's assume we have a test run that includes the following test cases with their associated components in brackets...

TC1 (C1)
TC2 (C1 and C2)
TC3 (C3)
TC4 (C2 and C3)

In the test run search we choose to filter by component and select both C1 and C2 meaning we want all test cases that are associated to C1 and/or C2. We would therefore expect to get the following list returned...

TC1
TC2
TC4

Instead we get the following...

TC1
TC2
TC2
TC4

The second result is duplicated because it is associated to both components that have been queried (likely a missing DISTINCT in the sql). The test case count at the bottom becomes inaccurate because counts them separately. In our previous example it would say that there are 4 test cases that match our filtering criteria in the current test run when in truth there are only three.

1. Associate five different components to a test case

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U SunOS sun4u en-US rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20030711

CERT_DecodeGeneralName fails if generalName is EDIPartyName.
Specifically the first call to sec_asn1d_confirm_identifier() fails
because the template has set expect_tag_modifiers to 0x80 while the
found_tag_modifiers are 0xa0.

Within the context of GeneralName EDIPartyName is an implicitly tagged
SEQUENCE. ASN.1 dictates that implicitly tagged types are primitive or
constructed depending on the underlying type. Since the underlying type
is SEQUENCE in this case the implictly tagged type should be constructed.

I think CERT_EDIPartyNameTemplate needs to have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED included
in its kind so that it expects 0xa0 and not 0x80 for tag_modifiers.
[and it continues to expect 0x05 as the tag_number of course]

I have not tried the X400Address but I suspect it has exactly the same
issue since it is also an implicitly tagged SEQUENCE and its template
does not have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED as part of its kind.

I took a look at:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.3/SecurityNssAsn1-11/nssDER/Source/nameTemplates.cpp

I also looked at the test certs that can be gotten to from

"CORE-227537","Make use of ELF visibility attribute","We have the potential for a fair speedup across the board on Linux (at least
6-7% by some rough measurements) by marking most of our functions and methods as
having hidden visibility using __attribute__ ((visibility (hidden))).  In
particular we can do this for the following types of functions:

- All methods and functions which are not to be called from outside of the DSO.

- _All_ functions and methods in our XPCOM component libraries because these
are only ever called from other DSOs via vtables. (with the special exception of
NSGetModule).

What does this buy us?

- You save a trip through the PLT for each call (one load and one jump)
- If a function does not access global variables and calls only functions marked
static or hidden you save some instructions at the beginning of the function to
set up the PIC register (and you gain ebx as a general purpose register in that
function to boot).

Hidden visibility also applies to global data though the savings isn't quite as
much.

So now the question is how we could apply this to the code base with the
minimal amount of work.  There are a few possibilities:

1. A macro on each method declaration.  It could be folded into NS_IMETHOD too
but we'd want a version that doesn't declare virtual and stdcall.

2. Implement per-class visibility in gcc and use a macro on each class declaration.

3. Implement a global -fvisibility=hidden switch in gcc and explicitly mark the
methods we want to _export_ (most of these are already annotated with NS_EXPORT
for win32).

Options 2 and 3 obviously don't buy us anything immediately and depend on
getting a gcc patch done and checked in and probably waiting for the next gcc
release that contains it.  They do however make the Mozilla code less messy. 
#2 isn't really that hard (I even have a rough patch although visibility is a
bit hosed in general on the gcc trunk).  #3 requires a lot more thought and we
could have a difficult time getting concensus on that (you have to come up with
a mechanism to know that all of your symbols from DSOs that you link with will
not be hidden).",972,"1"

That is to wrap a  exactly at the number of characters specified by

The problem is that all the relative widths that are font based are
relative the height not the width:

RFC2683 recommands that clients never send commands lines longer than 1000
bytes and servers never accept commands longer than 8000 bytes. Mozilla however
sends even longer STORE commands sometimes.

I believe it happens at least when trying to expunge a lot of mails. Mozilla
first marks all of them as deleted I guess? And sounds like it doesn't optimize
the messageset too well either.

Anyway you should make sure it splits the operations into 1000 bytes or less.
Most servers do limit the maximum line length and Mozilla breaks with them with
large mailboxes.

special characters in the fragment identifier in a new window it works just
fine (goes where it's supposed to) but if I try to use a link like this in the

So either these special characters in the fragment identifier (#foo) should be

"CORE-980630","Remove type nuking","Created attachment 8387201
patch

When an OOM occurs during inference we nuke all type information in the zone and disable inference.  This behavior is incompatible with bug 972817 and it isn't really necessary anymore: it was originally in place because with a web of interdependent constraints we are left in an inconsistent state if an OOM occurs in the middle of solving those constraints but now constraints are not interdependent and can only trigger recompilation of particular scripts or invalidation of new script information.

The attached patch removes type nuking and instead relies on other mechanisms such as marking type sets as unknown when OOM occurs.  Inference APIs are generally left alone and still generally infallible.  There are a few places where OOM can leave us in a place that isn't easy to recover from such as when copying data during GC sweeping or when adding scripts to the pending recompilation list.  In these places we just MOZ_CRASH it doesn't seem worth it to add a new mechanism to recover here when crashes here aren't easy to trigger and the rest of the browser just crashes on OOM anyways.",3,"0"

The last file (in-product-3.6.inc.php) is used by both firstrun and whatsnew pages.

You will find attached to bug 528943 an archive of the files to translate if you do not have SVN access. If you use the archive please attach your translations to this bug and not to bug 528943 :)

The staging site for these pages currently works for en-US so you can see what the pages will be like:

http://www-3.6.stage.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/firstrun/
http://www-3.6.stage.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/whatsnew/

(you need Firefox 3.6beta to display the pages correctly).

GDC 2014 Team Shirts

>>Project Overview:
Mozilla has participated in previous editions of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and this year's event will prove to be a larger more prominent stage for Firefox games than any other edition of years prior. There are several major announcements with new partners that will be of great significance to the industry as well as potential new business relationships. 

One of the aspects of Mozilla's presence at GDC this year includes a booth twice the size of our booth last year. While still a small booth in relation to some of our show floor neighbors (we will be down the row from Google) this is an opportunity for our staff to make a noticeable impact among attendees. We will be running demonstrations and presentations at the Mozilla and Mozilla's partners' booths and it is important to have a unifying appearance clearly identifying the Mozilla team wherever they are across the venue while we discuss how far Mozilla games have come and will be going during the next year.

>>Creative Specs & Deliverables:
Deliverable:
1 t-shirt design 
Simple versatile (not necessarily GDC 2014 specific) impactful includes the text Firefox Games Team.
Some ideas include having Firefox Games Team across the front and the HTML5 knight (from last year) on the back or the Firefox logo on the front and Firefox Games Team on the back. Black t-shirt with white text may be the way to keep the look polished but casual while making a visual impact but open to interpretation and suggestion.

"WWW.MOZILLA.ORG-529053","[vi] 3.6 whatsnew/firstrun localization","This bug is for the localization of the new firstrun and whatsnew pages for Firefox 3.6. 

These pages are located on a separate svn branch only for 3.6 work:

https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/branches/firefox3.6/ADDYOURLOCALECODEHERE

You will first need to check out your repository example in a console for Chinese:

svn co https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/branches/firefox3.6/zh-CN/ .

There are 3 pages to translate all very short you have a copy of these pages in your locale folder on svn here are the paths:

/firefox/3.6/firstrun/index.html
/firefox/3.6/whatsnew/index.html
/includes/l10n/in-product-3.6.inc.php

The last file (in-product-3.6.inc.php) is used by both firstrun and whatsnew pages.

You will find attached to bug 528943 an archive of the files to translate if you do not have SVN access. If you use the archive please attach your translations to this bug and not to bug 528943 :)

The staging site for these pages currently works for en-US so you can see what the pages will be like:

http://www-3.6.stage.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/firstrun/
http://www-3.6.stage.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/whatsnew/

Patch

Thunderbird 3 doesn't display any search results for queries sent to my school's (Michigan Tech's) LDAP server when bound anonymously.  It looks like the problem is that the result entries don't have an objectClass and nsAbLDAPCard::SetMetaProperties [1] assumes that every entry has at least one object class (see lines 307-310 [2]).

The attached patch just clears m_objectClass earlier and returns NS_OK if rv is LDAP_DECODING_ERROR after trying to get the objectClass values which is returned if the attribute isn't present.

opened in another the browser will crash after ~200 calls.
The same effect in Mozilla on Linux and Windows. On Windows it also says there's
a problem in XPCOM library.

1.open the page test.html 
2.wait until counter gets to ~500


Actual Results:

It seems that when you call an addItem on an CalDav calendar the aListener.onOperationComplete is always called with Components.interfaces.calIOperationListener.MODIFY. 

I thinks it comes from the underlying calMemoryCalendar (cache system)

Cloning a test case and including the option 'copy document' causes the entire document history of the cloned from test case to be passed on to the clone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to Recreate:
1. Create a test case with a few version on it. (i.e 5)
2. Clone the test case as a copy. Make sure copy document is checked.
Actual Results:  
The new test case has the same document history as the original.
When cloning a test case the entire history of the test case comes with it.

Expected Results:  
I expected that the copy document feature would copy the most recent document version only.

If there is some reason why it makes sense to also clone the history of a test case when creating a new copy I would expect this as an option otherwise I would expect the copy to take only the most recent document since the history actually has nothing to do with the test case itself.",29,"0"

there is no explicit test for it in Linux.mk it will default to x86.

And trust me it's quite entertaining to watch arm-linux-as munch on x86 
code...

Simple fix is to add the following lines in the coreconf/Linux.mk file:

ifeq ($(OS_TEST)armv4l)
        OS_REL_CFLAGS   = -DLINUX1_2 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE
        CPU_ARCH        = armv4l

However since you can have different ARM types (forst 2 are version last for 
endian IIRC) there should be a smarter test.  However since I think only 
recent ARMs can really chew Mozilla armv4l might be best (it represents most 
Strongarms...dunno about the new XScale.  My ARM knowledge isn't great).",3,"0"

today's nightly build from the trunk

part of the difference is talkback which accounts for 800KB on the branch and
is still missing on the trunk.  negotiate-auth and tasks extensions are built on
trunk and not on the branch.

The big difference is that the files that go into browser.xpi are not being
stripped (browser.xpi itself is ~1MB larger on the branch than the trunk). 
Files going into other .xpi (such as mail.xpi) are being stripped properly.

The rest is from the installer itself (mozilla-installer-bin) which is not
being stripped on the branch.  The stub installer does seem to be stripped as
the files on the ftp site are similar in size.",6,"0"

"CALENDAR-338167","Localizability issues with recurNthWeek and recurLast in dateFormat.properties","The way recurNthWeek and recurLast messages are constructed is troublesome for languages where grammatical gender of weekday names is varied.

For example in Polish (with diacritics removed since UTF8 at Bugzilla sucks):

Monday is poniedzialek - grammatical gender: masculine
Sunday is niedziela - grammatical gender: feminine

Also for different grammatical genders adjectives like Last and numerals like First or Third are varied for different genders:

First Monday - pierwsz_y_ poniedzialek
First Sunday - pierwsz_a_ niedziela

Last Monday - ostatni poniedzialek
Last Sunday - ostatni_a_ niedziela

So when messages are constructed like this:

recurNthWeek=%1$S %2$S of the month

where %1 and %2 are substitued for ordinal.name.XXX and day.XXX.name we can only get one form while at least two (or more for languages other than Polish) are needed.

For example:

recurNthWeek=%1$S %2$S miesiaca

for number 1 gives us:

Mon: Pierwszy poniedzialek miesiaca - CORRECT
Tue: Pierwszy wtorek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Wed: Pierwszy sroda miesiaca - INCORRECT (should be: Pierwsza sroda miesiaca)
Thu: Pierwszy czwartek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Fri: Pierwszy piatek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Sat: Pierwszy sobota miesiaca - INCORRECT (should be: Pierwsza sobota miesiaca)

We dont have duplicate PPC xserves in production. If any one production PPC xserve dies we'll have to close the mozilla1.8 tree and block schedule security releases until we have the replacement PPC xserve configured and ready for use. Apple has discontinued PPC xserves so we cant just buy one.  

To prevent this situation we have another PPC xserve (bm-xserve01) which I believe is idle and which I'd like to setup as a 2nd PPC builder slave. 

afaik during this year bm-xserve01 has been used for:
- partner build repacks. however Kev has now moved repack work to dm-partnerdist01. There are still some files lingering here from those repacks so Kev will manually cleanup and confirm in this bug when all his stuff is off.
- central mac update of all macs. This hasnt been used in last year/two and unclear if it ever worked. Also unclear if it works for only xserves or also for mac minis.
- occasional random mac script testing. This can be done on any other mac like a mac mini or one of our staging xserves. 

I'm filing this bug to see if anyone can think of reason to keep bm-xserve01. If there's no objections we'll go ahead with the backup and repurpose.",43,"0"

Open a separate bookmark window from Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks... and
choose some website with its entry in the separate bookmark window.
Now double click(I wish it's single click) it to open the actual
website view.
It spawns a new navigator window and the site you choosed to see is in it.
In Netscape 4 this doesn't spawn a new navigator window but just overwrite the
content of the navigator window which has window focus at that time.

I'm not sure it's a bug or by design but anyway I hope it'll be fixed.
If it's by design please change the design and make it spawn a new
tab in a focused navigator window instead of spawning a new navigator window.

Currently if you want to insert an image you have to mouse down and click on don't use alternate text.  I've probably had to do this hundreds of times.  I asked in the forum about was there a way to set this as the default and all I got was nasty flack from someone carrying on about how I disliked blind people and what I wanted violated some standard.

All I'm saying is leave the initial default to requiring alternate text if you want but have a way for the rest of us to once only set the default to no alternate text.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X en-US rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Firefox supports window.onerror from Internet Explorer as a way of handling any JavaScript errors that go uncaught: 

window.onerror = function(msg url line) {
  ...
}

When this function is invoked in Internet Explorer the JavaScript stack from when the error was thrown is available using arguments.caller/callee. In IE it's as though the exact line where the error was caused calls the window.onerror function.

In Firefox the stack information is not available in this way. 

I think the best thing to do (and which I wish IE did) rather than calling onerror with the stack intact is to expose the actual object that was thrown and not caught. In Fx this object already has the stack property which will provide a good amount of information about the state of the JavaScript stack when the error was thrown. Additionally any object that custom JavaScript code throws should also be available in the onerror function. 

So I can think of two quick and dirty ways of exposing the thrown object. One is to add a fourth parameter to the onerror function:

window.onerror = function(msg url line err) {
  ...
}

Another would be to save the last uncaught error as a property of the window object:

window.onerror = function(msg url line) {
  var err = window._mozLastError
}

I think that this change would be very helpful for developers working on complex JavaScript applications. We are used to Java where we can wrap the main() function in a try/catch+print-stack-trace statement for diagnosis of any problem. Because JavaScript+Browser has so many possible entry points (event handlers window.setTimeout  loading etc) there is not an easy idiom to use that replicate this catch-all functionality. window.onerror is the obvious mechanism to use but to be fully useful it needs to somehow expose the state of the stack when the error was raised.

Actual results:  After step 5 focus is visually still at the location chosen in step 2.  After step 6 not surprisingly focus moves to the next focusable object that follows your location from step 2.

I am requesting that this be included among the other Firefox 3 Accessibility Commitments (bug 396346).  Aaron since I know you'll ask... :-)  I do not yet know if this is a regression or not.  My guess would be that it's something we just haven't noticed because so many forms fail to use proper labels. :-(  For those that do however the current behavior is confusing/disorienting.

"CORE-268535","crashes where rt->gcFreeList turns into a small int after last-ditch GCs","I created a multithreaded test app in an attempt reproduce atom related crashes
we've been seeing. It didn't expose crashes with the exact same stacks. But it
does show some interesting problems.

I'll attach the source. I don't have a generic Makefile for it. But it is only
one .c file that builds as a standalone executable that uses only spidermonkey
and nspr. It creates one JSRuntime and a bunch of threads that each create a
JSContext and loop through the evaluation of scripts each containing a bunch of
randomly generated identifiers (all within JS requests).

The scripts currently look like...

function FOO {var FOO_1 var FOO_2}
function BAR {var BAR_1 var BAR_2}
FOO()
BAR()

Of course it creates a ton of those lines. And the identifier lengths are also
randomized.

I believe that my test code represents a valid use of the api and that all
scripts are themselves valid.

I've seen this test fail in a few ways:

1) Crash in js_AllocGCThing (jsgc.c:479) where rt->gcFreeList is equal to 1 (but
should be a valid pointer or NULL). This *seems* to happen when one or more
other threads are doing last ditch GCs. I've seen this a number of times.

2) A ReferenceError reported by the error reporter (e.g. ReferenceError: FOO
is not defined). The identifier in question in these cases in shown as text by
the error reporter. It is always actually a valid identifier that is in the
script (the test code guarantees that - and I've  validated the script contents
in some of these cases to be sure). This error indicates that the interpreter
failed to find an atom at runtime that it absolutely should have found. I've
seen this a bunch of times. This *might* indicate a corrupted atom.

3) A crash in QuoteString (jsopcode.c:402) called by
js_AtomToPrintableString in the case where the interpreter is trying to build
the string to report a ReferenceError (as above). This looks like a case where
the atom that the interpreter is trying to lookup is not only not found as a
property but that the atom used for the search actually represents a bogus
JSString while the interpreter is still trying to use it. I've seen this once so
far.

There are a bunch of #defines at the top for thread counts GC frequency
identifier length etc. I've been twiddling this stuff a lot and seeing
different effects. This test is just a quick hack at this point.

I'm hopeful that this will help in figuring out problems we've been seeing. And
that this might be a starting point for a multithreaded smoketest (at least).",82,"0"

The fact it crashes FF completely is definately a bug in JS coding.. and on a quick glance of the source it looks similar to a buffer overflow attempt.

The fix

I was just writing some documentation for nsIAddressBook.idl (for another bug) and came across this function:

string abCardToEscapedVCard(in nsIAbCard aCard)

All it does is to call aCard->ConvertToEscapedVCard(param) which happens to return a string as well...

Considering when I was documenting the function I was thinking that the proper way is just to get the escaped vcard from the card itself I think we can just drop this. There's two callers (one SM one TB) and it'll save us getting the ab service in those instances (as well as the redundant call).

I also found an rv = x return rv combo to tidy up.",0,"0"

Currently mozilla\toolkit has two themes for windows and linux: winstripe and qute. Qute is built by Thunderbird. Firefox and xul runner use winstripe.

I think we can get closer to having thunderbird built on top of xul runner if Thunderbird was converted to use the winstripe theme for toolkit instead of qute. 

And it will make theme maintence a lot easier since I won't have to keep porting winstripe changes back to qute.

"CORE-336559","Investigate a better security model for injecting functions into evalInSandbox","Currently the accepted model for injecting functions into Components.utils.evalInSandbox is to simply stick the functions on the sandbox object itself. So in a JavaScript component one might do:

var box = new Components.utils.Sandbox(someURL)
box.foo = myFoo
box.bar = myBar
Components.utils.evalInSandbox(untrustedScript box)

As we saw in bug 321101 and friends this lends the untrusted script unwarrented access to the calling (chrome) code giving it a handle which it might be able to use to pull itself out of the sandbox and run chrome code. For bug 321101 (or more specifically bug 319263) we decided to plug all known holes that could lead out of the sandbox but that is really a stopgap solution. We should come up with a better way of exposing functions.

bug 321101 comment 20 describes one such solution. It has the advantage that all objects in the sandbox are created in the sandbox so following anybody's __proto__ or __parent__ chain won't get you anywhere. The major hurdle to that solution however is that a chrome function that returns an object (as opposed to a primitive such as a string) re-opens the hole. The patch in that bug attempts to use (basically) |return eval(uneval(rval))|. However this fails pretty quickly for native objects.

I'm filing this bug to find a solution that makes everybody happy (whether we continue with bug 321101's approach or find a better one).",1447,"1"

"MAILNEWS_CORE-437975","Can't send emails to non-mork mailing lists","Created attachment 324269
The fix

I'm not 100% sure if this is a regression but I expect it is. In bug 437903 it was reported that we can't send to mailing lists for OS X directories.

The problem I'll address here is that the nsMsgCompose::CheckAndPopulateRecipients function does not support finding mailing lists from other address book types when it could easily do so.

Currently the function is trying to get the nsIMDBDirectory and its nsIAddrDatabase early on so it can use them to increase the popularity of the recipient in the database. As you'd expect this fails for non-mork address books and so the function doesn't get to the stage of finding the lists for those.

This is a bit hard to test on its own but the unit tests for the existing mork address books pass (they do exercise this function) Mac mailing lists will still fail due to bug 437903 outlook ones should work.

Note whilst debugging this I also found that we weren't clearing the mailListArray between each loop this didn't cause a major problem but did mean we were iterating through the sum of all the mailing lists so far rather than just the ones for the current directory.",2,"0"

Hallo Alex

mir ist heut' noch etwas aufgefallen im Master-Passwort-Dialog (Tb2 und
Tb3):


Jetzt steht da:
Bitte stellen Sie sicher dass Sie das Master-Passwort das Sie
festgelegt haben nicht vergessen. Falls Sie das Master-Passwort
vergessen sollten gibt es keine Möglichkeit an die Daten zu gelangen
die von ihm geschützt werden.

Mein Vorschlag:
Bitte stellen Sie sicher dass Sie das Master-Passwort das Sie
festgelegt haben nicht vergessen. Falls Sie das Master-Passwort
vergessen sollten gibt es keine Möglichkeit an die Daten zu gelangen
die davon geschützt werden.


In meinem Vorschlag ist nur ein Komma mehr (hinter Möglichkeit) und
statt von ihm hab ich ein davon eingesetzt.
Das zusätzliche Komma mag den schon komplizierten Satz noch
komplizierter erscheinen aber ich glaube der müsste dorthin um die
zu-Konstruktion vom restlichen Satz zu trennen.
von ihm hat mir beim Lesen nicht gefallen da es sich auf eine Person
bezogen anhört. davon wäre neutraler.

mfg
Thomas

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ich würde den Satz des Entity masterPasswordWarning.label noch weiter ändern zu:

Bitte stellen Sie sicher dass Sie dieses Master-Passwort nicht vergessen. Falls Sie das Master-Passwort vergessen sollten gibt es keine Möglichkeit an die Daten zu gelangen die davon geschützt werden.

Somit würde man das mehrfache verwenden von festgelegt umgehen. Festgelegt findet man schon oberhalb der Eingabefelder im Einleitungssatz (masterPasswordDescription.label).

Es wäre schön wenn wir uns noch vor SM 2.0 und Tb 3.0 dazu einigen könnten.",3,"0"
"SEAMONKEY-91113","java plugin install broken for Windows ME","I do most of my e-commerce buying with IE on Windows ME.  I decided to try and
purchase a weedwacker repair part today using Mozilla 0.9.2 on Windows ME.

I browsed www3.sears.com (their parts direct web page) and entered 358799260 as
the model number of the weed wacker.  An intermediate web page was presented
that showed this was a Craftsman Weedwacker and gave me the opportunity to
confirm by clicking Continue which I did.  On the next web page I clicked the
radio button that allowed me to view a diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft
and cutter head.

A popup window was displayed with the message:  Click here to get plugin 

So I clicked as directed to start installing the Java 2 plugin for Windows.

The installation ran to completion.  Afterward I once again tried to view the
diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  I exited Mozilla and restarted the
browser at which point I received an audible bell and an error message about
needing to restart to allow something to complete installation.  So I rebooted
my computer and restarted Mozilla--no error now.  I revisited www3.sears.com and
tried once more to view the drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  Well obviously the install didn't work.

I viewed the installed Mozilla Plugins (Help -> About Plugins) and noticed that
Mozilla did _not_ list a Java plugin.

However if I open the Windows ME control panel and invoke the Add/Remove
Programs applet I see Java 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition v1.3.0._01
listed as an installed app.
It appears to me that the Java Plugin installation is not working for Mozilla

"CORE-117153","build crashes on startup with PAC enabled","This affects 0.9.7 builds as well as builds from the tip at least as of Dec 27
2001.

If I have my pac file enabled I will crash often (half the time) on startup. 
Here's a stack trace of both the UI thread (thread 1) and thread 6 which is
accessing the PAC file.

See the URL above. 31 piecharts are drawn by javascript after it requests data from the server. These piecharts are incompletely rendered on the page - less than a quarter of the circles is rendered. Covering and uncovering the window then renders the correct complete image. Even pulling down a menu causes the area underneath to be repainted correctly. Note that when the data is refreshed (this happens every 10 seconds) some more of the pies is rendered but not all of them.

Actual Results:  
The SVG piecharts are only partially rendered.

Expected Results:  
The SVG piecharts should be completely rendered.

This page renders fine in Firefox 1.5.

I'm submitting this as a major bug because it may be enough to prevent us upgrading. If we cannot trust it to correctly render dynamically updated status warnings (pies turning red in our case) we cannot use it. Of course you may have a different opinion.

I tried to produce a single file that shows the problem but it seem to only appear when the data is fetched separately from the SVG file. This makes me think it may be some kind of timing issue.",198,"1"

"CORE_GRAVEYARD-335076","[BeOS] Wrong rendering of point-sized font tags","This problem started to be visible after 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=327406
checkin.
Two users noticed it with dualhead setup so virtual screen size was 2560 * 1024.
http://beos.spb.ru/mozilla/MozillaFontPointSizeBug2.png - look at counter at
bottom.
But it should be noticeable with single moder big monitors too so i'm wondering if someone has 1960*1200 or such monitor here.

Problem is lack of DPI API (and DPI-awarness at all) in BeOS so we use some tricks here
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/gfx/src/beos/nsDeviceContextBeOS.cpp#136

but it seems that following code is also not so perfect.

As possible fixes and workarounds i propose
1)add layout.css.dpi also to BeOS section of all.js
2)restrict max resolution unconditionally to some valuse in nsDeviceContext - but what that value should be?
72 (this is DPI with which BeOS was designed in mind) produces too small fonts) ?
96?
Looks like it needs testing
3)that hack in source code before - I propose int(mHeightFloat*72./600.)
instead. As hardly someone will set dualhead to increase vertical resolution - it is hard to imagine monitors on top of eachother. Even Bill Gates don't do it with his 3 monitors!

4)Currently we always report single monitor in ScreenManager:
NS_IMETHODIMP
nsScreenManagerBeOS :: GetNumberOfScreens(PRUint32 *aNumberOfScreens)
{
  *aNumberOfScreens = 1
  return NS_OK
}
Looks like times are changing but I'm doubt that there is good piblic BeOS API to handle this poblem",7,"0"
"CORE-76350","dialogs come up in mail/news too small","Build is from the morning of Apr 17.

For some dialogs in mail/news including the password dialog for my imap account
and the dialog for an SSL warning come up too small to include all of the

text area and text are cut off.  In the case of the SSL warning dialog none of
the buttons are visible so I can never accept the warning to read my mail.

Danm and I think that this is because the OnLoad event is firing too early

"SEAMONKEY-132380","Merge Schedule and Notify tabs in Bookmark Properties","I spoke to first Ben and then rjc about this on IRC a few weeks ago. rjc agreed.

The idea is to merge the Schedule and Notification tabs for a few reason:

a) They are closely related. In fact they depend on each other when a checkbox
to enable Scheduling is not set the whole Notification tab is disabled.

b) It makes the dialog faster to load (I think). This is usually not an issue
but I saw this bug a few days ago that specifically said this dialog takes too
long time to load...

c) It makes sense.  :-)

I'll try to work on it and come up with a patch.",568,"1"

It was present in older versions of Mozilla dissappeared then reappeared when
bug 142986 was solved. That is it exists with RC2 2002051008 but not older
2002050706 build.

If a folder of bookmarks is copied and pasted somewhere else in all the
arborescence of the folder (copy and/or original arborescence) bunches of
separators will be added at the end of the subfolders that originally contained
separators.

I created an attachement in bug 142986 that I'll repost here later. I also gave
there an extreme example: After a few hours of use of Mozilla a folder that
originally had 3 subfolders 11 bookmarks and 2 separators had 510 supplementary
separators at the end.

Only folders that had separators before the copy paste action will present this
issue. This leads to the quick and dirty workaround : delete all you separators
and this bug won't hit you.

In no situation I have tried (many) does the DOMSubtreeModified event fire.

According to page 27 of the DOM2 Events Module:

This is a general event for notification of all changes to the document. It 
can be used instead of the more specific events listed below. 
[ ...  ...]
The target of this event is the lowest common parent of the changes which have 
taken place. This event is dispatched after any other events caused by the 
mutation have fired.

For me this means that EVERY modification of the subtree including node 
replacement removing/adding nodes changing attributes ... should fire it. As 
said in the spec it also should be fired together with one of the 
events listed below:
 - DOMNodeInserted
 - DOMNodeRemoved
 - DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument
 - DOMNodeInsertedInDocument
 - DOMAttrModified
 - DOMCharacterDataModified

Once this works the entire Mutations (1.6.4) section will work in Mozilla 
possibly passing the entirety of section 1.6 (Event Modules)?

I removed SP2 and Firefox opened/worked fine. Contacted Microsoft about SP2 and
they said to contact you.

This appears to be similar to Bug 273098 but when I went to link:
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225894#c32) with possible fix it
referred to Monzilla and Shockwave. But according to Microsoft their impression
is a conflict which seems to me to be more basic than some unique fix on my
computer. This seems to me to be a fundamental problem warranting a fix in your
program? (Besides to be honest such a fix - which is only a 'try this?' may be
beyond my computer skills as it seemed complicated and I am afraid may mess up
my computer with no assurances it will work.)

If I create frames with the DOM API calls and append them to a Frameset they
are not visible.  There are different forms of this problem depending on whether

"CORE-413286","table cell spanning a column with width of * is too small","The second table in the attached testcase has a total width of 400px and a COLGROUP definition of:

 
  
  
  
 

It contains a table cell that spans the second and third columns. Before the checkin for bug 368504 this cell had a width of 75% (300px). Since then the column width is only 25% (100px). I believe the former sizing was more correct.

In the testcase the allocated cell widths are as follows:

Table 1: 25% 50% 25%
Table 2: 75% 25%
Table 3: 50% 50%

If my interpretation of the HTML specification is correct I would expect the following cell widths:

Table 1: 25% 50% 25%
Table 2: 25% 75%
Table 3: 25% 75%

The widths of the cells in table 3 didn't change with bug 368504 but they also do not look correct to me. That is probably a topic for a different bug though.

In the testcase the P is given a border-color of green and the DIV is given
a border-color of red. The SPAN is then set to a solid border and told to 
inherit its border-color. The calculated border-color is red. This is wrong
since the closest parent of the SPAN is the P with the green border-color.

I've noticed a problem when a compiled Mozilla 1.6 on Solaris can crash on
Solaris machines even if they have the recommended Solaris patches in
'Installation Instructions for Mozilla Ports' page at
http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.6/installation-ports.html
I am compiling Mozilla on Solaris 8 with the latest recommended patch cluster
and the following addtional patches...
108434-14  108435-14  108773-18  109147-27  111697-04  111721-04

The machines the build crashes have at least the minimum patch revisions on the
Mozilla web page but they don't seem to be enough. I have a suspicion that patch
111721-04 (Solaris 8) and 111722-04 (Solaris 9) for Math Library could be the
culprit as they include support for new data types for which Solaris machines
without that patch would'nt be able to support.

I can't exactly say which patch is definitly causing the problem as when Mozilla
started to crash for me i had it fully deployed in my department and i updated
the patch revisions for Solaris 8 and 9 to their latest versions and sent them
out to all machines to stop people screaming at me

I think the web page detailing the Solaris recommended patches will have to be
updated and possibly the list of patches in the patch checker in Bug ID: 230598
which has just been checked into the 1.7 branch.

This problem came up in the discussion for Bug ID: 230598 and Roland Mainz

By default the checks are turned off and it is responsibility of jseng user to
call JS_SetThreadStackLimit with the correct information see bug 220408 .

Now the problem is how to get this maximum allowed stack address as it seems it
is not very well documented subject on any platform. If NSPR would provide such
API it would be great but past experience tells that it would not happen soon
(the original bug was reported more then a year). 

On other hand if the minimal stack address is known with precision of 10K or so
then adding 100K to it would provide a reasonable guess that would work out of
the box in the vast majority of cases. 

Obtaining the imprecise minimal address is also trivial for any NSPR thread as
it will always have some code near beginning of the stack that calls the
supplied thread callback and returning the address of the first declared NSPR
variable should be sufficient to prevent crashing Mozilla with trivial scripts
(like attachment 113927 which I just used to verify that it still crashes

on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

with a problem in the Seamonkey browser. This bug seems to be specific to
Firebird as the web page in question seems to be handled correctly with the
standard Mozilla browser. For that reason I'm assuming this warrants a separate
bug.

The problem exists in the latest nightly builds of Firebird on both Windows and
OS X.

The problem page uses  to
define the page icon. It doesn't have a corresponding REL=icon line.

If I save the entire page locally and load it from my computer the problem goes
away. I can keep reloading the page and the icon remains in the URL bar. Could
this be because it's not using the cache?

As a side note the icon continues to be shown on the tab and the bookmarks

Could search have tokens that would automatically be substituted. e.g. Date is ?

It's wonderful that it defaults to today's date. But what about tomorrow?

I have so many accounts and folders that I lose track of what came in what went out and particularly where the heck it is now. A saved search would be great to keep around.

Build Identifier: 

The table.html.tmpl template makes use of HTML  and 
tags to specify the class of the table cells in a column.  This
appears to not be well supported by Mozilla based browsers.  This
issue was found while working BUG 264511 and briefly discussed on the
Bugzilla news group
(http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.support.bugzilla/browse_thread/thread/f33246457384e418/7d97e2ef5b376d91?lnk=gst&q=larsonsonline#7d97e2ef5b376d91)
and at that time it was suggested that Bugzilla should refrain from
using the  tag.  The solution is to specify the class in each
 for each column.  The patch is very straight forward but it does
increase the size of the generated HTML by a fair amount.  I can
supply a patch if desired.

"NSS-488396","DBM needs to be FIPS certifiable.","The shared db/dbm split was made to try to remove code from the FIPS boundary. One way of doing that is to not FIPS validate the DBM code.

This would be fine normally as all the objects passed accross the sdb_ boundary (the interface to both sqlite and dbm) are all encrypted. The problem is DBM needs to decrypt that data and reencrypt it to preserve it's date interface. That means for dbm to be FIPS the legacy dbm code needs to be included in the FIPS boundary.

To date we believe the only thing that needs to happen to make this work is to include a .chk file and verify the dbm .so file when in FIPS mode.

This bug is for making that change and any other change needed by the lab.

"CORE-231199","Make mapped-attribute hash case sensitive","Rigth now the hash for 'uniqued' mapped attributes is case insensitive wrt the
values of the attributes. This is good and all in theory since it allows us to
squeeze more attribute-maps together and thus have a smaller rule-tree and fewer
attribute-maps allocated.

However the disadvantage of having a case insensitive hash is that it's slower
then a case sensitive one. Having a case sensitive one would also make it easier
to use the same code for SVG and possibly XUL. And we'd be able to save some
code. There are also some attributes in html that should be case sensitive (like
background) so if we want to keep the current code we need to fix it anyway.

And it'll speed up the cases where we don't have a lot of elements with the same
attributes since hashing case sensitivly is faster the case insensitivly. I
would think this is a pretty common case too although i don't have any data to
back that up.

And in practice making the hash case sensitive probably won't cause a noticable
difference in number of unique maps for a page. In most cases where there are a
lot of elements with the same attributes the markup is generated either using
some GUI designer (composer frontpage) or generated through CGI. In both cases
it's pretty likly that the same casing will be used everywhere. And even for
manually created pages i doubt that one and the same page will use more then two
or three different casings.


This also raises the issue of weather we should sort the mapped attributes
(which we do to make the hash attribute-order-insensitive). However the gain
seems a lot smaller here so before anyone does this we should probably
investigate weather we'd actually win anything.


As a sidenote i should mention that the current hash is actually partly
case-sensitive. The code to calculate hash-values is case sensitive but the code
to check equality is not. The endresult is that we most of the time already are
case sensitive. This has been the case since unique attributes were introduced.",18,"0"

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 2.0.0.9

This has happened multiple times now:  The same message appears twice in my inbox (inbox on IMAP server not local inbox).  Also some messages don't appear in my inbox but if I do a Search the Search does find the message and says it is in the inbox but then if I go to the inbox it definitely does not appear in the list.

I know this is a bug because if I use Rebuild Index on the inbox folder the duplicates disappear and the messages failing to appear then appear.  Rebuild Index fixes the problem... until it happens again some time later.

I am using IMAP and I am keeping the messages on the IMAP server so that I can access them from 2 different computers (both using Thunderbird).   I have the Offline Messages option enabled for all folders.   This combination of IMAP and Offline Messages is probably where the bug is -- I imagine this bug doesn't occur if using POP.

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce this bug I expect that you must be doing what I am:  using IMAP and leaving the messages on the server (NOT downloading them to your local inbox folder).  i.e. the bug occurs with the inbox folder on the IMAP server and probably not with the local inbox folder.   Also I have the Offline Messages thing enabled for all folders that is probably also required to reproduce this bug.

Congstar/Firefox OS graphic for German Facebook post

>>Project Overview:
Team

We need to explore how we might tastefully in a brand-compliant way add a partner logo into a Firefox OS Facebook graphic along with the Firefox logo. Something that implies that we're partners but per Pete that include photos that reflect who we are (vs reflecting Congstar product exclusively)?

If possible it would be great to see two examples. I'm guessing that John would need to show to Pete once we decide on direction 

The copy that has already been approved for the post is:

#FirefoxOS is the only phone with adaptive search. It's always changing to offer you the exact apps you need the moment you need them! Get yours today!

For Congstar we're changing the last sentence to Get yours from Congstar today

The original idea for the graphic was a photo of someone holding the phone with adaptive search on the screen (specifically in German in this case). But we're open to ideas - you have a much better idea of the graphics available to us. We have some photo compilations here as well. https://etherpad.mozilla.org/FirefoxOSphotos

I imagine some kind of imagery with the brand guideline of having the Firefox logo in the corner. Perhaps the congstar logo is in the other corner? 

This is a rush job (we're scrambling here as well to make this work.)

The post goes up Nov. 10. We'd need to see graphics by Nov. 6 which would give us two days to get all the approvals (Plus Congstar needs to see) If this is an unworkable deadline please advise.

wrapped until its dtor. The assumption is that when XPCOM releases xpc dll's 
nsIModule and causes a call to ReleaseXPConnectSingleton then the last 
relference on the xpconnect service will be released. At this point (when xpcom 
has told xpconnect that the system is going down) xpconnect marks all wrapper so 
that no calls will cross the wrappers into the great unknown.

However the JS Loader holds a ref to the xpconnect service and these 
connections do not get severed when they should.

I'll attach a stack tht shows this.

This is reproducable by doing 'touch components/*.js' then running and closing 
mozilla. JSObject Finalize calls that happen when the JS Loader deletes its 
JSContext (causing a GC) go through xpconnect and become Release calls on native 
objects that are not in a godd state anymore after xpcom has otherwise shutdown 
much of the native system.

I've been through the same problem elsewhere... It would be nice if the system 
were robust enough to always do the right thing during shutdown but much of 
mozilla is not. It is better to leak than crash.

I'll attach a proposed fix. 

The fix changes the loader to only get the xpconnect servive when it needs ti 
rather than holding a longterm ref. I also added code to xpconnect to make sure 
that the service is not brought back from the dead after being shutdown - I've 
seen this before. The patch has the InitClassesWithNewWrappedGlobal code too.",3,"0"

Hi

biobar 1.1 has been updated and is available on the update.mozilla.org page.
However the version shown on the main page is still biobar 1.0. The extension
update from firefox for biobar does not pick up the new version either. On
trying to update from firefox the error always is 'Firefox was not able to find
any available updates'. 

I have version 1.2 ready to roll out but am not doing so because this mechanism
is not working.

This is related to Bug 248919 but although that bug has the status Resolved I
do not see any change.

When this happens we end up creating a 0-size memory cache (as well as not creating the right size for some of the Places caches during startup etc).  The problem happens particularly often if PR_GetPhysicalMemorySize is called twice within a short period of time (which is what happens during startup) but it seems to be happening in some other cases too (which causes the test failure in question).

The relevant (Mac-specific) code is:

302     struct host_basic_info hInfo
303     mach_msg_type_number_t count
304 
305     int result = host_info(mach_host_self()

309     if (result == KERN_SUCCESS)
310         bytes = hInfo.memory_size

and it looks like things fail when |result| is not KERN_SUCCESS.  In fact in my tests it's often 5 (which is the generic KERN_FAILURE value).

Requesting blocking since this has some pretty serious performance implications: we end up creating memory caches that are completely the wrong size in various places.

"CORE-315728","NAMEPREP / text rendering holes in IDN processing","IDN processing is defined to only use characters in the Unicode 3.2 repertoire. However at least one character U+1160 'HANGUL JUNGSEONG FILLER' first defined in Unicode 4.0 can be shown to pass straight through the IDN name preparation logic as in this example:

   www.python.info 

is translated to:

   www.xn--python-eyy.info

instead of being blocked as an invalid IDN. Although this character has dodgy space-like rendering in the current Mozilla rendering code and is therefore a display-spoofing risk it is neither ignored nor prohibited in the current NAMEPREP rules designed to prevent these problems since the ignore/exclude lists in NAMEPREP do not address characters not in Unicode 3.2.  

Fortunately this particular character is currently caught be the hand-rolled ad-hoc IDN dodgy-display-character blacklist and is displayed as Punycode. However it would be better if the IDN code was strictly RFC-compliant with regard to characters not in Unicode 3.2 and that this name was thus treated as invalid during the IDN processing removing the need to catch it as a special case at display time.

Although this particular case is not a serious security problem _in itself_ it does suggest that the current IDN processing code is still not watertight and therefore that there may be other unknown IDN spoofing or other security problems lurking which are still not addressed by the current code.",3731,"1"

seductive convenience. But it's flawed creating modal windows that don't behave 
correctly the cause of various blanket bugs like 25684 and 39439 (both currently 
considered nsbeta2+).
  This problem can only be fixed by trying much harder to find a proper window to 
be the modal dialog's parent. nsNetSupportDialog should be relegated to providing 
backup when herculean efforts to locate the actual parent window fail for some 
reason.
  As an example the cookie service has been taught to use a proper parent window 
for its dialog by laboriously storing a reference to that window's nsIPrompt in 
nsHTTPChannel from which it can be extracted and passed around while processing 
notification events punting to nsNetSupportDialog only when no other choice is 
available. That same sort of thing needs to be done in many more places.
  One such place is nsWalletlibService::OnEndDocumentLoad. I plan to take this 
one rather than dump it on someone else since it looks rather easily fixable.
  Happy recipients of this bug would spread the happiness most widely if they 
would start using a good nsIPrompt window. The modal windows don't behave

I created a folder named ~FromHome~.  It worked fine. I created a filter and it
moved a bunch of email into the new folder. 

When I restarted Mozilla the folder did not appear. The files are in my home
dir.  The filter complained that the folder did not exist anymore.  

May be recoverable by renaming the email files....I will try it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create ~folderName~
2. Put some mail in it.
3. Restart Mozilla

Actual Results:  
The folder and mail are gone.  

Expected Results:

I have a bookmark for a group of tabs. When I created it some icons where available which changed in the meantime. In particular one page did not load and had the warning symbol (exclamation point in yellow triangle). Those icons were saved and are displayed in the bookmark manager.

Now icons changed in particular the one with the warning. They are always displayed correctly in the tabs when I call the bookmark. The icons shown in the bookmark manager are never updated though. There also seems to be no way of manually updating.

The list of all tags (with checkboxes) that you get by toggling the Show all tags button inside the Edit this bookmark popup dialogue is not sorted correctly. Current sort order is upper-case a to z lower-case a to z then words that begin with upper-case umlauts finally lower-case umlauts. This is likely to confuse users who are looking for a specific tag in the list as that sort order doesn't make any sense at all in terms of usability. The dialogue should use at least use the same default sort order as in bookmarks Library > Tags: just sort all tags alphabetically (while ignoring case and umlauts). Ideally umlauts should be sorted in as ae oe ue but that might be a localization issue to be dealt with seperately.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have loads of tags with different sorts of initial letters: upper-case lower-case and German umlauts (ä ö ü = ae oe ue)
2. Open Edit this bookmark popup dialogue by clicking on yellow star
3. Click Show all tags button to toggle open the list of all tags (with checkboxes) in the dialogue
 


Actual Results:  
Tags in the list are sorted in a rather unexpected three-fold way that makes it unnecessary difficult to find the right tag (e.g. a tag named OEM Software might end up miles away from another tag named oem).

-- undesired sort order: --
upper-case a to z
lower-case a to z
upper-case umlauts a to z
lower-case umlauts a to z


Expected Results:  
At least use the same default sort order as in bookmarks Library > Tags:
-- desired sort order: --
just sort all tags alphabetically (while ignoring case and umlauts).

Ideally umlauts should be sorted in as ae oe ue but that might be a localization issue to be dealt with seperately.


The effect of this can be quite annoying as (lower/upper-)case of a given tag is changed (edited) on the fly as you type. Say these are your tags in the wrong order as described in this bug:

OEM <--
Opel
oem software
offer
often
Österreich
österreichisch

Next time you do tag-as-you-type and accidentally type oem instead of OEM FF will edit the tag's name on the fly OEM becomes oem (for all affected bookmarks) and thus moves to a completely different place in the (wrong) sort order:

Opel
oem <--
oem software

I upgrade from 2.18.4 to Bugzilla 2.20.1 last week and now i have a problem with the new ssl behavior.

We use http/https for connections from intranet and block http via firewall from internet only https is allowed. But we have customers who need to connect with http (didn't accept self signed certificates in proxy configuration) so this customer ip is special configured in the firewall to accept connects with http. 

Until the upgrade all work fine but now i can connect the login page with https and if you submit the login data the submit is send with http that is blocked by the firewall.

I've try parameter sslbase and ssl with several combinations but nothing works. Either it switch at submit from https to http (ssl=never) or i will be redirected to https even if i start the connection with http (ssl=always or auth).

The right behavior for ssl force redirection = never should be that i connect with http and stay at http and if i connect with https i stay at https.

There was a similar bug in 2.16.x if i remember correct.

"CORE-397651","[FIX]PSM duplicates subject/object principal code","It looks like nsCrypto.cpp has (somewhat bitrotted) clones of the GetObjectPrincipal and GetSubjectPrincipal code that lives in the security manager.  I think we should remove this code and just use the security manager directly here.

All that this code is really trying to do is to find the current principal active on the given JSContext.  The JSContext in question comes from the current native XPConnect call context.

In other words I think this should just be a GetSubjectPrincipal call into the security manager.

Requesting blocking on the assumption that bitrotted security code is bad.

Oh and I'm not sure why this is doing all that stuff with manually calling JS_EvaluateScriptForPrincipals instead of using nsIScriptContext.  The current code looks like the event could run after the JSContext has been destroyed.",54,"0"

replaced with:
  $contenttype = text/html charset=utf-8

Sorry I'm not so familiar with cvs to make a proper patch. And also I'm at all
not good at Perl and do not know where to get just a server's charset (not
entire header) to avoid hard-coding 'utf-8'. But I hope just finding places will

The main phorum page of this web site use 2 graphics to display the stat of a
message (visible or not visible). The default is not show the message and I put
a graphic.

Well when you click in it. The message shows and the graphics is replaced for
another one (via javascript). But it doesn't change!

In IE the things work right

I believe that the javascript use standards methods and properties :-)

The problem I think is the 2nd graphic is not loaded. IE load the graphic
*later* when it is setted by javascript code.

I think that mozilla must load all that it need when the page is modified via
javascript: if the code chage the a graphic for another it must be loaded.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.laotraesquina.com.ar/
2. When the phorum page load. Click into the papiro graphic


Actual Results:  The message shows but the graphic doesn't change

Expected Results:  It'd have to change and load the new graphic setted by
javascript  (I think)
IE load it later and I believe that it must be the expected result because it is
very usefull for intranet/internet applications (with graphics and others html
components)",711,"1"

When I have the following in my userContent.css:

*[accesskey]:after {
  content:  { attr(accesskey) }
  -moz-opacity: .4
}

I get crashes in about:config.  I right-click to get the context menu then
click New to get the submenu then I move the mouse outside of the menu and
click.  Most of the time I get a crash.

I'll mark it as normal because even though it's a crash it should be rare.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert the CSS into userContent.css.
2. Start Firefox.
3. Go to about:config.
4. Right-click to get the context menu.
5. Click New.
6. Move the mouse outside of the menu.
7. If Firefox hasn't yet crashed click outside the menu.
8. If the menu closed without crashing repeat from step 4.
Actual Results:  
Crash.

Expected Results:  
The menu should have been closed.

"THUNDERBIRD-325458","Recipient Autocomplete: Nickname does not get highest precedence for matching address book entries for searchphrase==nickname [To CC addressing field/area toplisted priority results]","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.5

I have an address book entry with the nickname wil.  When I type wil in the To line in the composition window the result is an entry who's last name is Wilbur and which has no nickname at all.

The algorithm for finding addresses in the phone book should have the highest precedence on a full string match of nickname (after all why did the user take the time to enter a nick name after all).  Imho the precedence should be:

1) Full string match on nickname
2) Full string match on last name
3) Full string match on first name
4) Initial string match on nickname
5) Initial string match on last name
6) Initial string match on first name

You may not think this is important but anything that causes mail to get sent to the wrong user inadvertantly is just about he worst possible problem a mailer can have.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an entry with wil as the nickname
2. Create an entry with Wilber as the last name
3. Enter wil in the To: field of the composition window

Actual Results:  
The entry with the last name Wilbur is autocompleted

Expected Results:  
The entry with the nickname wil should have been autocompleted

I entered this defect before and have seen others report it.  However I searched Bugzilla and searching for nickname did not find it.  I apologize if this is duplicate but after about 30min searching I couldn't find the old bug.",3289,"1"

(2)  Once logged in I get an error message (filename) could not be saved
because the source file could not be read when attempting to download a file.

This site worked OK last week when I was using Mozilla 1.0.  I upgraded to 1.3
to use another site that works with 1.3 but not 1.0.  The planetaec site worked
with Internet Explorer 4.0 today so I am convinced this is a Mozilla problem
(maybe the way it is set up on my computer) but not a site problem.

5.if logged in to the site with a password first the pdf download screen comes
up then immediately it is eclipsed by an error window that says (filename)
could not be saved because the source file could not be read.
6.click on OK and the error and the download window close.  I can't download
the file.
 


Actual Results:

"NSPR-66325","PR_LoadLibrary picks up same named file on SHLIB_PATH even if a pathname is specified.","This bug only affects HP-UX.  On HP-UX PR_LoadLibrary calls
shl_load() with the DYNAMIC_PATH flag.  If an application is
linked with the +s linker option the DYNAMIC_PATH flag of
shl_load() causes it to search for the shared library in some
search path such as that specified by the SHLIB_PATH environment
variable.  However the way shl_load(DYNAMIC_PATH) uses the
search path is very aggressive.  For example if you have a
libfoo.sl on your SHLIB_PATH all of the shl_load() calls below
will succeed (assuming none of the specified pathnames refer to
an existing file):
    shl_load(libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)
    shl_load(./libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)

    shl_load(no/such/dir/libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)

One would expect that only the first call should succeed i.e.
the dynamic library search path should be used only when a
plain file name containing no directory is specified.  Indeed
this is the behavior of dlopen().

We should modify PR_LoadLibrary() to pass DYNAMIC_PATH
to shl_load() only if the specified name is a plain file name
containing no directory so that PR_LoadLibrary has the same
behavior across all platforms.",0,"0"

"THUNDERBIRD-494962","Include Protovis and jQuery + some jQueryUI bits in TB3","This bug is about adding some third-party OSS code to Thunderbird 3.

The criteria that drive me to suggest them are the following:

a) we want to have a development platform that is as easy to work with for as many people as possible both for add-on authors and core contributors.

b) if we can include open source code which is well maintained and provides unique modular capabilities that fit well with our stack then we should consider including them.  

c) we want to enable rich interactions and user experiences and building frameworks to support these in-house is a huge investment which even the Firefox team is unable to do (witness the lack of an animation framework even though there's lots of UX desire for more animation support).

Today doing visualizations or animations in TB3 is currently very hard because the platform doesn't provide it. 

I'm proposing that we include two libraries:

 - protovis for visualizations as I use in bugs 489999 and 492158.
 - jquery + some of jqueryUI for easy DOM/CSS manipulation including animation and fade effects.

Some background:

Protovis is described at http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/.  It's an actively developed project by the people behind prefuse and flare which were both very popular but flash-based systems.  Protovis is heavily based on technologies we promote such as canvas (in their first version) SVG (in their current version) and advanced JavaScript usage.

Protovis is covered under the BSD license so is easy for us to include.  The examples are worth looking at to get an idea of the capabilities of the package: http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/.

The authors of protovis have made changes to the code to make it easier for us to include (e.g. avoiding namespace pollution providing a versioning scheme) and if we have specific objections I think it's likely we can get them to make changes.

Protovis is not only useful to deliver compelling features but also provides a really simple way for us to provide a great visualization toolkit as part of the Thunderbird 3 platform.  As an example the tag pie feature (see http://ascher.ca/blog/2009/05/08/getting-insight-into-ones-own-email/) which I don't think is useful enough to include in Thunderbird 3 is trivial to build as an extension:  the visualization bit is as follows:

    var tagPie = {
    [...]
      render: function tagPie_render() {
        let data = []
        let totalCount = 0
        for each ([tag count] in Iterator(this.tagCounts)) {
          totalCount += count
          data.push([count this.tagInfo[tag].tag this.tagService.getColorForKey(this.tagInfo[tag].key)])
        }
        if (data.length < 1) return
        data.sort(function(ab) a[1] > b[1])
        let tagpie = this.context.idoc.createElement('div')
        tagpie.setAttribute('id' 'tagpie')
        tagpie.setAttribute('class' 'tagpie')
        this.context.idoc.getElementById('column').appendChild(tagpie)
        let vis = new this.context.pv.Panel().canvas(tagpie)
        vis.width(128).height(128)
        let scale = (2 * Math.PI) / totalCount
        let wedge = vis.add(this.context.pv.Wedge)
          .data(data)
          .left(64).top(64).outerRadius(60)
          .angle(function(d) d[0] * scale)
          .fillStyle(function(d) d[2])
        wedge.anchor(center)
            .add(this.context.pv.Label)
            .text(function(d) d[1])
        vis.render()
      }
    }


There is obviously some implied commitment to deal with eventual bugs maintenance releases and figure out an upgrade strategy like with any embedded 3rd party software.  Given the low complexity of the package (one javascript file) this feels like an overall win.  Andrew Sutherland is the likely person who'd own maintaining protovis given his interest in visualization and use of protovis in the past (see exptoolbar).

Open questions:

 - where in the tree would this go?
 - how should it go? (I would suggest that it be loaded as chrome://content/messenger/protovis2.js so we can update minor bugfix releases but have to explicitly change things if there's a non-backwards-compatible major version update)

2) jQuery + jQuery UI

(jQuery is available under the MIT license).


The big drivers for jQuery inclusion are in my opinion:

 - support for animations and effects would be really really easy at least for HTML parts of the UI
 - it would provide a massively popular layer of utility code which we currently lack in particular around DOM manipulation.

I don't think that all of jQueryUI is ripe for inclusion though -- the widgets in particular would I suspect be too hard to integrate from a look and feel point of view and the interactions are not that useful.  But the JQueryUI core + effects would give us 90% of the benefit while limiting scope.

A few other points about jQuery:  

 - I suspect (but have no real data to back it up) that there are an order of magnitude more developers using jQuery and filing bugs against it and testing it than any bit of Gecko let alone comm-central.  

 - Jetpack for Firefox embeds jQuery for many of the same reasons that I argue we should.

 - jQuery had a reputation for stepping hard on other libraries.  That has AFAIK been fixed and you can even use jQuery w/o the $() function (but using jQuery() which we may want to say is a requirement for in-tree code if the $ scares people.

The cost to the TB team of maintaining jQuery is likely even less than Protovis because it has hundreds of thousands of users and is already embedded in a lot of products.  Apple Nokia Microsoft etc. all use jQuery in various ways.  I don't think I need to remind people that jresig works for MoCo. -).

If Thunderbird 3 provided built-in Protovis & jQuery combined w/ our much better JS APIs (folderpane gloda whatever part of STEEL we end up with) I think we have an exciting and solid platform to get add-on authors excited.

A few other notes:

 -- I don't know what the download size delta would be but I would be surprised if it was significant given that we can ship minified JS code if we want. 

 -- If we go ahead we will have to think about when we update these third-party libraries much like the Gecko guys think about when to update sqlite.

[11:17]		dietrich how would the keyword search bookmark get named then? by title?

[11:19]		dietrcih. so what if the user has google bookmarked and then also keyworded search bookmarks google...they'd both be the same name? I think the user should be able to uniquely name the search at it's creation.

patch

The attached patch deCOMtaminates and devirtualizes nsICSSParser.  The COM interface class nsICSSParser becomes a pointer-like wrapper class nsCSSParser which allows us to continue hiding all the implementation details in CSSParserImpl (which still exists but has no virtual methods anymore).  Also responsibility for recycling parser objects now rests with nsCSSParser.cpp rather than nsCSSLoader.cpp.  The bulk of nsCSSParser.cpp did not have to change at all.  The contents of nsCSSLoader.h have been folded into nsCSSLoader.cpp as nothing else needs to see them anymore.

From an external perspective most uses of nsICSSParser change from

   nsCOMPtr cssParser
   rv = cssLoader->GetParserFor(nsnull getter_AddRefs(cssParser))
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)
   rv = cssParser->ParseWhatever(...)
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)
   cssLoader->RecycleParser(cssParser)

to

   nsCSSParser cssParser(cssLoader)
   NS_ENSURE_TRUE(cssParser NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)
   rv = cssParser.ParseWhatever(...)
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)

If you don't have a nsICSSLoader object handy you can just construct the parser object with no arguments and it'll still participate in the recycling scheme.",133,"0"

The problem is that Fx2 is the current stable browser not Fx3a2 and Bugzilla belongs to Mozilla and so releasing a product which doesn't display correctly with another Mozilla product looks really non-professional.

Using a fixed layout table and TD + COLSPAN the size of the cells are wrongly
calculated. Looking at the code it looks like the width of the table available
to cells is decreased by (numColumns * cellspacing) without taking the colspan
variable into account. This leads (as showned in the test case) to the total

The speculative connection happens in the BrowserCLH which is ~1.5secs before we actually try to use the URL. The java prefetch happens a little sooner than the Gecko speculative connection and that might mean we get a little better headstart in powering the radio and DNS.

That said having two pieces of code that do the same type of thing is redundant especially during startup. Given that Gecko can actually re-use the speculative connection we would remove the java prefetch.

If the java prefetch has no measureable advantage we should remove it. We need to do some testing using cold powered down cell radios. Launch fennec with an intent to load a URL externally. Measure how long it takes to get to throbber stop. With and without the prefetch.",217,"1"

The signature is invalid because the quoted printable data will be verified - 
not the 8bit data - 8bit data cannot be signed - only 7bit data can be signed 
and verified.

This BUG has been verified on multiple platforms (WinXP Linux Suse 9.1 MAC 
OSX).

This BUG consists of TWO problems :

1. YOU MUST always reencode the message to 7bit/quoted printable PRIOR signing 
as stated in RFC 2633

3.1.3 Transfer Encoding for Signing Using multipart/signed

   If a multipart/signed entity is EVER to be transmitted over the
   standard Internet SMTP infrastructure or other transport that is
   constrained to 7-bit text it MUST have transfer encoding applied so
   that it is represented as 7-bit text. MIME entities that are 7-bit
   data already need no transfer encoding. Entities such as 8-bit text
   and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base-64
   transfer encoding.

2. For verifying mails have to be ALWAYS encoded back to 7bit/quoted printable 
PRIOR verifying - theoretically - the mail within my sent folder (8bit signed) 
should be INVALID but it is not - because you do not canonicalize the data 
before verifying which is an RFC violation too.


SOLUTION :

IF the mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you sign.
IF a signed mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you 
verify.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Deactivated the setting -> Edit->Preference->Mail & 
Newsgroups->Composition->For Messages that contain 8bit characters use 'quoted 
printable' MIME encoding and sign an email with smime using 8bit characters (i.
e. german umlauts)

Actual Results:  
Invalid signature on recieving clients and (also mozilla or any other for that 
matter)

Expected Results:  
Reencode Message to quoted printable/7bit prior signing",435,"1"

6. Whilst the download window is still open relaunch firefox

Expected:
Firefox window starts up with previous session's tabs present

Actual:
Firefox starts up but not with the session-you-just-closed's tabs

I guess this is because when you shut down the last browser window but with the downloads window still active firefox doesn't consider this to be closing firefox down so no session data is saved.

Perhaps instead of firefox saving session date only when the firefox.exe process is closing it should do it when the last browser window is closing?",1035,"1"

This is a problem because C++ code in mozilla calls methods that can be implemented in python passing NULL to the params it's not interested in. The C++ side expects that the call will succeed and that the non-null params will be correctly populated. Instead it's aborting with an error:

NS_ABORT_IF_FALSE(pi->IsDipper() || ns_v.val.p No space for result!)

An example of this situation is when the implementation of nsDocShellTreeOwner::GetSize calls ownerWin->GetDimensions passing nsnull for the position arguments.

Currently the new Day / Week views allow Drag'n'Drop of events via right mouse button too. This gives confusing results if you use an operation of the context menu afterwards.

Example 1:
After dragging an event to a new position via right mouse button the context menu for that event pops up. Select Edit Event and open the Edit dialog. 
Error: You will notice that the dialog still displays the old date/time of the event. Press Ok and you will see two event boxes in the view: one at the old position and one at the new position.

Example 2:
Try to resize with the right mouse button. 
Error: You will move the event instead of resizing.

If you play around you will find several other problems based on this principle.

I think the views drag'n'drop feature should only work via left mouse button.",13,"0"

"FIREFOX-424626","(linux) Firefox is put into offline mode on startup when NetworkManager is running but not controlling the active network interface (e.g. when using PPP)","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux x86_64 en-US rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008032215 Minefield/3.0b5pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux x86_64 en-US rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008032215 Minefield/3.0b5pre

On my Debian system I had the NetworkManager service running however my wired network interface was controlled manually (in my case the relevant entry in /etc/network/interfaces was iface eth1 inet static which prevents NetworkManager from managing that interface). Therefore when using the wired interface I had network access however NetworkManager reports no network devices present (the commandline program nm-tool yielded:


NetworkManager Tool

State: disconnected

print_devices(): didn't get a reply from NetworkManager.
There are no available network devices.
).

This caused Firefox 3 to startup in Offline mode which forced me to manually uncheck File->Work Offline at the beginning of each session.

As a workaround I now disable the NetworkManager service before starting Firefox (now nm-tool reports

NetworkManager Tool

get_nm_state(): didn't get a reply from NetworkManager.


NetworkManager appears not to be running (could not get its state).
).

If NetworkManager intends that it is accurately reporting the online status of the computer (does it? or does it intend to only report the state of the connections that it is managing?) then I suppose that NetworkManager has a bug.

However in any case Firefox should have a config option that the user can use to tell Firefox not to query NetworkManager upon startup. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install NetworkManager
2. Configure things so that NetworkManager does not control any of the active network interfaces (I believe you can do this by adding all of the active interfaces to /etc/network/interfaces providing each of them with at least one option other than auto or dhcp). nm-tool should report state disconnected as described above.
3. Start Firefox. Observe that File->Work Offline is checked.
Actual Results:  
File->Work Offline is checked

Expected Results:  
I would expect that if I start Firefox when I am online (able to access remote web pages) and File->Work Offline was not checked at the end of my previous session that File->Work Offline would not be checked upon startup

I have heard of other people having similar problems in slightly different circumstances (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/191889).

Since NetworkManager cannot currently be relied upon to accurately give the online status of the system I am requesting an option that tells tell Firefox not to query NetworkManager upon startup. I could not find such an option at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Category:Preferences.",178,"0"

But it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions.

The GNOME icon code in modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/gtk/ is really really slow.  I've described this on IRC in the past and some people had useful suggestions.  On my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds *per icon*.  This is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has OK and Cancel buttons (since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time).  But it's a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file: URL in any displayed bookmarks -- if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file: URLs in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi-second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open.

Using some printf(!) timing since profiling of things involving X server etc. can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsIconChannel::InitWithGnome seem to be:
 * the call to gnome_icon_lookup typically around 300ms
 * the g_object_unref of the icon theme (odd) typically around 50ms
 * the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot -- sometimes it's almost instantaneous sometimes it's near 50ms sometimes in between

When I brought this up on IRC a bunch of people had suggestions for improving the last part but that's actually not the bulk of the time.

Hi Mike!
I'm emailing you because you seem to be responsible for AMO or at least one of the team. It seems that there is an old dev copy of AMO online which is indexed by Google at http://remora-3.5.php5stage.mozilla.com/.

A quick search for Adblock Plus returns an old version at the dev address compared to the official site:
http://remora-3.5.php5stage.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865.

Personally I think this should be removed from the Internet for several reasons not the least that people could find this site instead of the official AMO and download some old copy or try to contact someone by some old email address or such.

However I wish you a very merry Christmas!

"CORE-461031","Investigate mobile responsiveness problems caused by not returning to the event loop","Vlad wrote an instrumentation patch to see why Fennec running on VMs has serious responsiveness issues while loading heavy pages such as CNN.com. Part of his patch works by basically doing setTimout(0) and watching to see how long it takes before the setTimeouts fire. On a VM he saw a lot of setTimeouts firing at regular intervals followed by a massive slowdown (on the order of one second).

In a test run he saw the following event being handled:

{BM(44)BM(10)ES(94)BM(103)BM(7)BM(54)BM(18)BM(37)BM(33)BM(11)BM(17)BM(10)BM(21)BM(62)BM(20)BM(16)BM(20)BM(7)BM(40)BM(17)BM(92)RP4(676)-E(0xb1a53de0676)}

To translate: we're calling BuildModel a ton of times during the same event without ever returning to the event loop. The sum of all of the BuildModel calls is quite a lot and could explain the loss of responsiveness.

I realized that what this probably means is that we're executing a script with many calls to document.write() each of which calls into nsParser::BuildModel. In this case the parser won't ever interrupt (and even when it's done parsing we won't get all the way back out to the event loop). We could verify this by adding a printf around nsParser::ResumeParse to make sure that we're not sticking around in ResumeParse forever but actually entering and exiting the parser code.",9,"0"

Under some circumstances doing a search on tripadvisor for a hotel for example scole inn and then clicking on the search result will crash camino.  The following error will appear in the console: camino[304] Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSRangeException: *** -[NSCFArray objectAtIndex:]: index (1) beyond bounds (1)]. I encountered this in normal browsing but it's easiest to reproduce a similar or same crash following steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start with clean profile following procedure in Camino FAQ or use troubleshoot camino
2.Set preference Open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows
3.Go to tripadvisor.com and search for scole inn and select first search result
4. Click Window and note presence of hidden popunder window. The presence of the popunder window seems needed to produce a crash.
5. Go to preferences and select Tab bar always stays visible.
Actual Results:  
On my system Camino will crash.

Expected Results:  
Tab Bar is displayed. I am not sure how Camino is supposed to handle the hidden window that is already there when you select always display tab bar or how Camino is expected to handle a popunder window if the open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows preference has been selected.

The tripadvisor site sets a cookie call CommercePopUnder and the presence of this cookie and value seems to have something to do with the crash. For example Camino will NOT crash if the cookie is present with the value SuppressAll.",1,"0"

As the canvas tag is not a standard anyway may I suggest the addition of a drawString method with parameters for font type size and string. 

In order to achieve usability canvas really requires an equivalent prototype method however the established prototype functions take immense amounts of clocktime and significantly (and unnessessarily) slow down the canvas. The current lack of standard in canvas makes it possible to include a drawString method before it is too late thus adding new possibilities to the object.

from here on) ASAP for the following reasons:

1) we do not have adequate QA for Mac OS X 10.1 and cannot ensure a quality
product - this includes Firefox 1.1
2) 10.1 has a very immature API - we can use more complete and advanced APIs
that are not available on 10.1 once support for it is dropped
3) Mac developers are stretched thin at the moment and expending effort on 10.1
compatibility would be silly at this point
4) the number of users on 10.1 is minimal and most people who would be using a
web browser a lot would have upgraded to another OS version or would not be
using Firefox
5) things are going to get much worse concerning 10.1 when we try to use cocoa
widgets and quartz
6) once support for 10.1 is dropped our code can be optimized further by
removing 10.1 workarounds

This bug should remain open until 10.1 support is dropped as I will be making
notes for things we can do once that happens (code we can remove optimizations

blank (fourth field in the second row of each attachment next to the attachment
date). From the code in the template (attachment/show-multiple.html.tmpl) it
would seem that this is to indicate attachment statuses (whatever they are - are
they related to flags?).

It would also seem that the vars which are used to fill the field are never
given any values in attachment.cgi.

The problem manifested itself in two forms:
(a) Doing a attr=createAttributeNS then element.setAttributeNode(attr) should 
trigger the creation of a namespace declaration for attr.namespaceURI on 
element. It doesn't.
(b) When doing appendChild(elem) where elem=createElementNS(...) a namespace 
declaration isn't emitted if a previous element with the same namespace 
prefix/URI was appended to the same parent without children. Demonstration code 
snippet:

		var doc = document.implementation.createDocument(

This bug is to address this and clean it up.  

In short the plan is to:

2. Provide more meaningful messages when encountering empty files (bookmarks output.xml's etc)
3. Provide the same type of diff output when comparing the bookmarks files so that a person can easily analyze the results file without having to bend their mind around two different output schemes.

and the element is automagically moved inside HEAD. That is a problem for the
editor more specifically for people wanting to edit documents made for MSIE
since MSIE explicitely allows BGSOUND anywhere. See URL attached to bug for
reference about this tag.

Did NS4.X have a restricted implementation of BGSOUND allowed only in the HEAD?
That's the only reason I can find for this code...

key.  Encryption increases the level of security for the information you send
from your browser over the Internet to the Aetna Navigator site.  Most browsers
support a minimum level of 40-bit encryption as well as a stronger 128-bit
encryption level.

    The Aetna Navigator site only supports 128-bit web browser encryption.  Even
though we use the more secure 128-bit encryption there is a certain amount of
risk involved in any Internet communication and Aetna cannot guarantee the
privacy and confidentiality of information exchanged in this manner.

    Understanding this if you would prefer to contact us by phone you can call
Member Services at the number on your ID card.  If you do not have an ID card
yet please contact your employer/group benefits office to obtain the toll-free
number.
How can you upgrade your browser to 128-bit encryption?
    The link to Netscape provided below can be used to download a 128-bit
encryption upgrade.
     
    Netscape Communicator link:
    http://home.netscape.com/download Please note:  For Netscape users Aetna
Navigator is best viewed using Netscape Version 4.75 - 4.77.  Use of Netscape
Version 6.0 is not recommended as it may result in the inability to access and
view some of the features and functions offered on Aetna Navigator e.g. access
problems with registration inability to access electronic explanation of

I called customer support and tried to explain that Firefox dous support 128 bit
encryption. I can log into my bank stock broker credit cards and other secure
web sites. The person I was talking with seemed to think I am lying.

I left a msg for the superviser - no call back yet.

Also posted a msg at www.aetna.com - the page has been removed.
 I suggested that Aetna contact Mozilla.org about this encrytion issue.

You simply cannot currently create a CFM build of Gecko anymore. At this point Mach-O is just unnecessary cruft in the PPC UA.

However removing a token from our UA may break websites. Though matching on Mach-O probably/hopefully isn't common since at this point all it tells you is that someone is running a PPC build which they could easily get by matching PPC.

Along those same lines I am having a hard time thinking of situations in which someone would have been using Mach-O to do useful detection of anything that's relevant today. It doesn't detect Mac OS X since only PPC builds have it. It was never the only way to detect if you were pre-X or X and even if it was it would have been a pretty unreliable indicator as CFM for OS X builds were shipped or at least I get that impression from bugzilla history.

"CORE-283531","nsIEventStateManager::DispatchNewEvent() has confusing argument names","The current nsIEventStateManager::DispatchNewEvent() signature looks like this:

  NS_IMETHOD DispatchNewEvent(nsISupports* aTarget nsIDOMEvent* aEvent
                              PRBool * aPreventDefault)

the confusing part of that is the last argument aPreventDefault. What we do
with that argument and IMO what we do is correct per the specs etc is to tell
whether or not the default action is enabled but the name suggests that it
means the exact opposite of that. This has lead to confusing code all throughout
our codebase code that looks like this:

  PRBool noDefault
  esm->DispatchNewEvent(target event 

and that leads anyone who reads that code to believe that if noDefault is true
then the default action was prevented. But again the exact opposite is what it
really means.

I'm proposing to change the signature to:

1) The mac crash reporter client says the report was submitted correctly and gives a UUID for the report:

I just submitted a report at 7:25 AM PDT and got back a UUID of bp-1bc88c87-0c5e-11dc-98fc-001a4bd43ef6

I think we need to review the logs from the processor. Aravind is the output from the processor currently being logged and is there some way to get access to these logs?

This behavior is very unfavorably as it hinders further sight onto message subjects directly after the selected message.  However this is the moving direction for the next N.

The bug I've found appeared in Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1 only all prior
versions works fine. 
The aim of that page is to provide web access to our University library's
catalogue. When you open the page you'll see the yellow square with several
fields and buttons. There is only one text field (for entering the search
phrase). Enter something there for example physics and press Ok button. In
Mozilla 0.9.9 and earlier versions and Internet Explorer you'll receive a list
of books which titles contains physics. In Mozilla 1.0 RC1 the form submits
new page loads but it contains no books info it's just the same as the page
what you see before submission (pay attention to the text just under the yellow
square in English it should looks like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was:
'. As one can suppose after submitting a form this should be
like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was physics' but in 1.0RC1 we actually
have '0 mathes found. Your query was:  ').
My little test shows that the difference between information sent on submission
in 0.9.9 and 1.0RC1 is that 0.9.9 sends 'ssub1=find' name-value pair when 'Ok'
button is pressed ('Ok' button is actually an image and has an OnClick event
document.forms[0].submit()) but 1.0RC1 does'nt. Maybe a server script
'prim.jsp' relies on this pair and when there is no filed named 'ssub1' in a

Build Identifier: 

What? - this patch extends Prism's JavaScript API by the restoreWindow() function which will restore a window when minimized. It has no effect on a not minimized window.

Why? - A prism application minimized to tray has no possibility to wake itself up. This patch remedies that. This is particularly useful when used with callback-enabled notifications. (I'll post a patch soon.) The application can give the user a for instance a notification about new messages and the user can restore the window by clicking on the large notification text instead of the small tray icon.

How to test? - Add the following code to an application running Prism with this patch and minimize it right after starting it. It will restore itself 5 seconds later.

Some of the early UE specs showed a To/From column instead of the 4.x-style
Sender column. Although I don't know for sure I assume that the idea is to look
at the From header and if it's the same as the current identity show the To
(or Newsgroups?) header. This has the advantage that it works when you're
keeping a whole thread (both sent and received messages) together.

------- Additional Comments From mozilla@bucksch.org 2000-02-18 04:33 -------
Phil I like your idea to compare the from with the email address of the current
identity. I always keep threads subject-based and the 4.x behaviour annoys me.

Will we have configurable columns? If yes I suggest to offer the described
combined To/From field (default) and additionally separate to and from field
for that case the proposed logic fails (which may well happen in some advanced
cases).


I suggest for the combined column to not only compare with the From address of
the current but all identities.

If the user has two identity : aaa@bbb.ccc and ddd.aaa@bbb.ccc.
I.e.: the first identity is a substring of the second one.

3.Try to reply to this mail and the From field will be aaa@bbb.ccc.



Actually I tracked the bug and managed to find that the function GetBestIdentity() of the file mozilla/mail/base/content/mailCommands.js was trying to look for the first identity that matches the optionalHint that is the concatenation of To: and Cc: fields of the original mail.

3) A bug fix for inline layout. If a text frame doesn't fit on a line but it registers a break opportunity at its end and that's the only break opportunity on the line nsLineLayout::CanPlaceFrame decides that it's OK to push the frame because there is a break opportunity to roll back to ... not realizing that the break opportunity is in the frame not before it so that strategy won't work.

IE has a similar working option (which is inadvertently set on true by default).

Now when you interact with Mozilla code you're used to do the conversion from top-left to bottom-most coordinate systems.

What surprised me when I sat debugging just now is that a few core Gecko APIs inside cross-platform code actually return cocoa rects on mac.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or feature but I'd think that the cross-platform code should behave the same on all platforms in this sense.

For example:

nsIFrame::GetScreenRect()
nsIFrame::GetScreenRectExternal()

If this is expected behavior I think a comment is at least warranted. Other XP-code (like nsAccessibility where this is used) depend on it.",29,"0"

Essential to the test case are

(i) Use of a popup window (OK if frameset.html is loaded directly)
(ii) Use of an explicitly-specified frame border (OK with default border)
(iii) Loading the SVG in frame 2 from an on-click event in frame 1 (OK if loaded by specifying src=frame2.html in the frameset).

They can just read the slot directly.  Happily this change does not conflict with Igor's patch in bug 511425.

* In fact I don't think block_{getset}Property can be called except with tinyids so tighten the runtime check for JSVAL_IS_INT(idval) to an assertion.

* Give js_BlockClass the stub JSClass.{getset}Property hooks. Instead when defining a property of a Block put the special block_{getset}Property getter and setter on it. No change in behavior but I think it's better to avoid using the JSClass-wide hooks when possible.",27,"0"

For WINCE builds the prototype mismatch can produce bogus calling code in nsWindow.cpp.",60,"0"
"MOZILLA_LOCALIZATIONS-342681","Small issue: Translation mistake in one of the error pages (Spanish)","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 es-ES rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

One of the error pages in Spanish (Spain) version of Firefox has as mistake since it includes the same sentence in Spanish and English:
___

Archivo no encontrado

Firefox no puede encontrar el archivo en /xxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx.

    *   Compruebe que ha escrito correctamente las mayúsculas en el nombre del ficheroCheck the file name for capitalization or other typing errors.

    *   Compruebe que el fichero no haya sido movido renombrado o eliminado.
___

As you can see there are two sentences (one in Spanish and the other in English) merged into one. The correct sentence should be something like: Compruebe que ha escrito correctamente las mayúsculas en el nombre del fichero o cualquier otro error al teclear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Get to that error message in Spanish (Spain) version of Firefox. That error appeared in my machine while having an incorect TEMP environment variable (it pointed to a non-existent hard disk drive since I took that disk off the computer).
Actual Results:  
Got the above reproduced error message with that mistake in the translation.

Expected Results:  
A well translated error message )

...or even no error message at all! (see below suggestion in Additional Information)

Apart from fixing that small mistake maybe Firefox could be modified so if the user has a wrongly set TEMP/TMP variable (for example a non-existent X:\Temp) it falls back to a default C:\Temp or something like that instead of showing an error message which doesn't even clue about having a wrong TEMP variable (I discovered that was the source of the problem after some fiddling).

Or maybe it would be enough to warn the user about having a TEMP variable pointing to an inexistent disk instead of that generic File not found message which doesn't help much to find what's the problem.",59,"0"

"NSS-247739","certutil program fails to read PQG files","function getpqgfromfile at label found_match frees the string and then
immediately passes the freed string to a function.  This causes the value
returned by this function to always be null.  

Thus certutil CANNOT succesfully read PQG params from any file.

CERTUTIL_FileForRNG ignores failure to open file and does not report error
message.  Caller (Certutil_GeneratePrivateKey) ignores return value.

CERTUTIL_GeneratePrivateKey doesn't check that dsaparams returned from
getpqgfromfile is not NULL and crashes or generates invalid output.

SECU_GetpqgString doesn't check return vallue from fopen and crashes if 
fopen returns NULL.  Should report error if file cannot be opened.

SECU_GetpqgString calls strlen twice on the same string.

SECU_GetpqgString only reads the first line of the file.  
But Base64 encoded files are typically multiple lines separated by EOLs.  
Perhaps getpqgfromfile needs to call SECU_FileToItem instead.

A related issue is that makepqg generates an encoded PQGParams struct
and outputs it into a file in any of 3 formsts:  binary hex base64.
But none of these reasonable formats is the format that certutil expects 
to read in.  certutil expects to read in a text file containing a single
very-long line that contains one or more base64-encoded PQGParams 
separated by commas (not spaces).  I don't know of ANY program anywhere 
NSS or not that generates such a file.  requiring the PQGParams file to 
be in this screwey format seems senseless and ensures that certutil cannot
read the output of makepqg.

I think a workaround can be made as follows:
a) read the whole file in not just the first line.
b) the AtoB decoder will ignore EOL characters I think.
c) commas can continue to be used to separate succecssive PQGParams in the
file.

"CORE-428326","Configuring with a relative srcdir breaks unit tests in XPCOM","Created attachment 314863
Use the absolute srcdir rev. 1

Configuring with a relative srcdir (e.g. ../src/configure) breaks unit tests in XPCOM. This is because we end up passing $(srcdir) to a binary which tries to initialize an nsIFile with it and nsIFile can only be initialized with an absolute path. easy though not especially pretty fix attached.

This is a regression from the tests of bug 416886 and I'd like to get it landed in CVS for 1.9",1,"0"
"CALENDAR-372868","Schema out-of-date error check forces Tb to quit so you can't disable Ln","Spin-off from bug 369819

Currently the schema out-of-date error check will quit the running app rather than allow you to possibly munge your data.

This is fine for Sunbird but for Lightning it has the unhelpful side effect of preventing you from getting to the Add-ons Manager to disable the offending version of Lightning.

For Lightning instead of forcing Tb to quit we should just disable Ln.",120,"0"
"BUGZILLA-283085","post_bug.cgi can be used to know which products do not exist and which ones are not accessible","In post_bug.cgi we have the following sequence:

my $product = $::FORM{'product'}
my $product_id = get_product_id($product)
if (!$product_id) {
    ThrowUserError(invalid_product_name
                   { product => $product })
}

and later:

if (!CanEnterProduct($product)) {
    ThrowUserError(entry_access_denied {product => $product})
}

This can be used by a user to know which products exist and which ones are not
accessible. As per bug 153461 comment 18 about describecomponents.cgi this
information should not be given.

Then the correct fix is the same as the one applied in enter_bug.cgi:

my $product = $::FORM{'product'}
if (!CanEnterProduct($product)) {
    ThrowUserError(entry_access_denied {product => $product})
}

"SUPPORT.MOZILLA.ORG-398246","Add support for custom cookies and cache headers","Adding support for custom headers and cookie names involves two steps:
* making session names configurable
* disabling auto-start for sessions

This can be accomplished in tiki-setup_base.php though it means in turn that all pages dependent on the hard-coded PHPSESSID cookie along with the basic session handler all need to be refactored to not assume there is a pre-existing session.

I'm looking at re-implementing some session libs I have from before.  Should do the trick.

This is a chicken/egg problem since we want to use non-default cookie names for NS rules.  We can't have the app auto-setting the cookie while simultaneously passing cache headers.  We need to separate the behavior so it's consistent and predictable for the proxy cache.

ETA is Thurs.  This affect performance and for a couple of reasons it blocks bug 398239.",174,"0"
"CORE_GRAVEYARD-37370","Switch command-line-handler to use category manager instead of a ProgID naming scheme.","Currently a command-line-argument-handler component needs to have a specific
ProgID for the command-line handler to be able to find it.

The jsconsole command-line-argument-handler for example _has_ to be named
'component://netscape/commandlinehandler/general-startup-jsconsole'. See bug
#37275 for more info on why this is now regarded as wrong.

Instead a command-line-argument0handler needs to register itself with the
category manager. JS example:

  var catman = Components.classes['mozilla.categorymanager.1']
      .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICategoryManager)
  catman.addCategoryEntry('command-line-argument-handlers' 'jsconsole'
      JSCONSOLESERVICE_PROGID true true)

Where JSCONSOLESERVICE_PROGID can be any string but preferably conforming to
the new naming scheme. I choose 'org.mozilla.general-startup.jsconsole.1' for
now.

I realize that the category manager is being used now as well just not in the
way the IDL states it should be used.",1775,"1"

"FIREFOX-408896","In a frame of a multi-frame window JavaScript methods location.replace() or .assign() or .href = do not replace the URL in the frame if these methods are called after a location.reload() command has been executed.","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.8.0.13pre) Gecko/20071126 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.13pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.8.0.13pre) Gecko/20071126 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.13pre


To give an example initially the following method works fine when the program starts up and it does replace the URL in the frame where the old URL was loading.htm and the new URL is getuser.htm:

	parent.contentFrame.document.location.replace(getuserfile)

This command works therefore the method itself functions in Firefox.

However this method does not always function. This and other methods worked consistently in previous versions of Firefox and even in the IE browser. They still work in the IE browser but not in recent Firefox versions those released in updates during the last couple of months. As far as I can tell when the URLs on two frames are accessed in sequential commands then something blows up. For example these are two sequential commands in a function which used to work fine but now does not work in recent Firefox versions (neither in Linux nor Windows OS):

	parent.navscrn.document.location.reload()
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.replace(LessonURL)

If I look at the variable LessonURL immediately before the location.replace() method is called it is correct. However the location.href is exactly the same for the frame both before and after these commands are executed. The location.reload() method is executed and so is the location.replace() method but the URL is not changed to the new one.

I have also tried the following alternative methods using both variables and literal strings:
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.href = LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.replace(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.href = LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.assign(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(file:///home/greg/Desktop/Greek%20Web%20Site/newfile.htm)
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(file:///home/greg/Desktop/Greek Web Site/newfile.htm)

None of these methods work. I also tried the following commands to set the LessonURL to include the protocol:
	var tempLoc = parent.contentFrame.document.location.href
	// and also tried: var tempLoc = unescape(parent.contentFrame.document.location.href)
	tempLoc = tempLoc.substring(0tempLoc.lastIndexOf(/)+1) + LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(tempLoc)

I have tried almost every combination I can think of at this time. This is likely a bug reported elsewhere by now but I cannot find it in your database. So I am reporting it again.

Thanks. Greg.

When literal containing newline characters serialized into XML newline
characters insert as is into the attribute of RDF:Description. Then while
reading this value from XML parser treats these newline characters as spaces so
writing and rereading of XML leads to lost line breaks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
text_res = this.RDF.GetLiteral(Some \n text \n goes \n here)
this.ds.Assert(this.selected this.rdf_text text_res true)
this.flush()
Actual Results:  
In the RDF file:
<RDF:Description about=rdf:#$XHK122
     otl:text=Some 
 text

 here />



There are two possible ways to resolve this prob:

1) Quote newline characters while serializing literal into the Description's
attribute.  works fine. Heh I've got no idea about possible issues with
different newline representation in different OS could it be a prob here?

2) Serialize complex literals as tag not attribute. I.e.
Some 
 text 
 goes 
 here

Both parses correctly but second is more readable (IMHO).",9,"0"

v.1

With an operation like:

  abababababab.replace(/a/g function(){return 'B'})

we currently call js_AllocStack/js_FreeStack before/after each js_Invoke of the lambda argument.  Like kindred functions in jsarray.cpp we can do this once for the whole str_replace operation.  This patch does just that for a 10.9% speedup (8.1ms) on string-unpack-code.

The correctness of the patch relies on the fact that the number of arguments to each js_Invoke invocation is the same.  This follows from (1) that JSRegExp::parenCount is a constant value for a given JSRegExp and (2) the regexp used in a single str_replace invocation is fixed (cannot be changed by user code).",2,"0"

SetBackgroundColor only sets backgroundcolor the view set itself transparent
when attached to a window instead.

We set the lastViewWidth and height in the constructor from the frame instead.

The first warning is trivial. The second warnings are due to the lines:

    STOBJ_SET_PARENT(funobj nsnull)
    STOBJ_SET_PROTO(funobj nsnull)

which expand to:

    (void)((!(0) || (((JSObject*)0)->classword |= 1)) (funobj)->fslots[1] = ((j

    (void)((!(0) || (((JSObject*)0)->classword |= 1)) (funobj)->fslots[0] = ((j

Hi

When I search on Subject or Sender in threaded mode in the main mail window I systematically get a crash when searching for all mails sent by my wife. Lots of other searches go fine but that one blows up every time. I'm afraid I haven't been able to spot another theme or reproduce a simpler test case.

When I'm not in threaded mode the search goes fine (I checked once I say the thread sorts in the stack trace included below from Apple's bug reporting tool).

On a side note (certainly already reported) viewing unread mails in threaded mode has lots of problems - if there are many mails unread in a thread clicking to open the thread doesn't usually work on Windows or Mac.

Cheers
Dave.

one actually works. :(

With the latest patch from bug 277303 applied I get the following output from

Fixing Indexes and Uniqueness.
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax

DBD::mysql::st fetchrow_arrayref failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax 
near 'PRIMARY' at line 1 at ./checksetup.pl line 2312.


The reason for this is that DropIndexes makes no allowance for the idea that it 
may ever have to drop a PRIMARY key. To do so requires this syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP PRIMARY KEY

Perusal of the code in DropIndexes shows that it can only produce the following 
syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP INDEX PRIMARY

There are two approaches to fixing this: either fix DropIndexes so that it 
handles PRIMARY key drops properly or just add the above line with the correct 
syntax in place of the DropIndexes call. The former is 'better' the latter 
is 'faster'... and at this particular moment with 2.18 release so near speed 
may be more important.",1,"0"

Using onbeforeunload with a loop can render the browser useless.

As example:
<body onbeforeunload=for ( var i = 0 i < 999999 i++) { alert('Alert') }
return false>

If JS is enabled and you tries top close the tab you run into an endless loop with an alert which blocks the complete browser.
It may be even possible that you can trigger it automatically with a redirect clause.
It is not a bug just malicious code. IE6 is also affected but i could not get it to work with Opera.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Visit the mentioned site with JS on.
2) Try to close the tab.

Actual Results:  
You get an long chain of alerts and the tab is not closed.

Expected Results:  
Allow to ignore the return value from onbeforeunload and allow to close the tab nevertheless.

"CORE-919144","Improve handling of nsDisplayFixedPosition and other layerizing properties that don't create stacking contexts","CSS properties that need to set properties on layers fall into two categories: those that force their element to be a stacking context and those that don't. The former case is relatively easy to handle: nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForChild recognizes the property as creating a stacking context and calls nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForStackingContext which then creates a display item which returns something other than LAYER_NONE from nsDisplayItem::GetLayerState and builds a layer with the right properties set on it in nsDisplayItem::BuildLayer. The element being a stacking context means all its descendant content can be rendered as the children of a single display item.

The latter case is difficult to handle because the element's descendants may be interleaved in z-order with other content that is not affected by the CSS property so multiple layers must be modified for a given CSS property on a given element. For position:fixed we tried to handle this by creating multiple nsDisplayFixedPosition display items and later opportunistically merging them. This turns out to be a real pain for lots of reasons. For example it complicates invalidation and it's complex to make sure that the right display items are created and merged. It also interacts poorly with our invariant that display item (frame key) pairs are unique.

We already have a better way to handle the latter case and we use it for scrolling. FrameLayerBuilder calls nsLayoutUtils::GetActiveScrolledRoot on the frame for every display item to figure out what the nearest scrolling ancestor is and display items are clustered into ThebesLayers so that all the items in a given ThebesLayer have the same active scrolled root. Each ThebesLayer is given a transform based on the scroll position of the active scrolled root for its items. (In bug 876321 and bug 913444 I extend that so that elements with animated top/left/right/bottom and margins are also considered active scrolled roots --- and it works beautifully and simply.)

I think we can keep extending this approach to handle position:fixed touch-action and other properties that don't create stacking contexts. Here's how it looks:
-- GetActiveScrolledRoot is generalized to compute for each display item a key tuple of the values that will determine properties of its ThebesLayer. The members of this tuple will be:
* The nearest geometric ancestor frame that is being scrolled or having its position animated or is position:fixed.
* A boolean indicating whether the display item should trigger default panning behavior when touched.
Other fields can be added as needed.
-- Items with different key tuples are forced into different layers. Thus all items in a ThebesLayer have the same key tuple.
-- FrameLayerBuilder is responsible for assigning layer properties to ThebesLayers (and other layers) based on the key tuple. These properties include a layer transform fixed positioning properties and some new property for touch-action.

The first thing to do here is to rework nsDisplayFixedPosition to basically get rid of the display item and generalize GetActiveScrolledRoot instead.",58,"0"

The 'transparent' background around a favicon in a tab has the wrong background

1. Open three tabs.
2. Hover the mouse over one of the background tabs.
3. Look at area around tab favicons
Actual Results:  
Notice how the background around the favicon in the hovered tab matches the rest
of the tab background.  Compare to the non-hovered background tab where the
color around the favicon doesn't match the tab background.  This happens with
the default favicon (little globe) or a real favicon.

Firefox does not appear to cache responses sent with Cache-Control: public header if they are sent over SSL/TLS. While I'm aware that Firefox generally doesn't cache responses over TLS for security in cases where the response is explicitely defined to be public this would seem to be incorrect behaviour. I'm testing caching behaviour by use of the Cache Source entry from the page info window.

For reference we're using TLS in this instance to ensure integrity rather than security (it's important that the user receives the response we're sending it's not important if anyone else can read that).

Right before I start to send off a request to save an attachment part from a message (non-cached message) I was calling |UpdateFolder()| on the listened folder (not INBOX). Then I build a to-do list of update messages to process (saving a TOC file is the first step). Then one at a time I process each message. This was working before the patch to fix bug 381992 was landed. However afterwords I can only get the attachment to save correctly if I remove my |UpdateFolder()| call. 

When the |UpdateFolder| call is made I see the |OnStartRunningUrl| call made in |nsMsgSaveListener| however I never see any calls made from relatively important libmime functions (like |imeObject_parse_begin()|) or OnStopRequest/OnDataAvailable. As mentioned above removing the |UpdateFolder()| call fixes the issue and attachments are saved just fine.

A suggested cause of the regression would be the changes from bug 381992.

We found though that when making weak references to DOM objects like iframes Cu.forceGC() didn't get rid of them--but that the iframe would eventually disappear.

I realized a few days ago while learning about the cycle collector that this is due to the fact that Cu.forceGC() is a simple wrapper for the JSAPI's JS_GC() which itself doesn't result in cycle collection.  In order for cycle collection to occur nsCycleCollector_collect() needs to be called.

I can see two ways of enabling this:

  (1) Modify Cu.forceGC() to call nsCycleCollector_collect() instead of JS_GC(). There's no need to additionally call JS_GC() because performing cycle collection also performs standard mark-and-sweep GC'ing.

  (2) Add a new Cu.forceCC() or Cu.forceCycleCollection() function that calls nsCycleCollector_collect().

I assume |node| is just something that looks like a DOM node to you (as in you didn't do wrappedJSObject on it or anything?

If so looks like the issue is that XPC_NW_DelProperty will throw NS_ERROR_XPC_SECURITY_MANAGER_VETO in general when touching content from chrome.

As far as i understand the fix for bug #298255 it was intendet to stop the
ability to load chrome urls from external applications and to clear the context
of javascript calls to about:blank.

Tested with Firefox 1.0.6 and it works as expected: can not load chrome and
javascript urls don't have access to document.cookie (although a
javascript:alert(document.cookie) gives the current domain as title of the alert
dialog instead of javascript application or about:blank).

But by calling a data: url it is still possible to do cross-domain scripting. Is
this expected behavior in 1.0.6 or was this overlooked?

unique_module_name.unique_name_in_module.number

I do *not* think that they ought all start with mozilla.

We need to do this sooner rather than later. The progid is a part of the

We need to get rid of the funky overloading of the progid to do dispatching:

This is not appropriate.

We should use the category manager for that. Some dispatch function is free is

I'm using javascript to populate an html table using the DOM functions
createElement appendChild etc. But there is a problem when I try to remove the
rows:
  I first loop in the childNodes of the tbody and remove some of the rows. The
result is immediately visible in the page.
  Then I reloop in the childNodes of the tbody to remove some other rows.
Surprisingly the rows I removed first are still there (from a javascript point
of view) and if I try to remove one of those ghosts I get the following error:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... Node was not found  code: 8
nsresult: 0x80530008 (NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_FOUND_ERR)  location:
http://localhost/functions.js Line: 58]

If I go to the DOMInspector the rows don't appear in the DOM tree but are
still shown in the childNodes of the tbody in the Javascript Object view.

Here is the tree :
table
  tbody
    tr
      td
        input type=checkbox (checked: the row is to be removed)
      td
        text and image
    tr (same as above)
    tr (same as above)
    tr (same as above)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a new file and paste this code:



function removeFromList(tBody){
  n_tbody = document.getElementById(tBody)
  n_trs = n_tbody.childNodes
  n_toRemove = Array()
  for(i_tr in n_trs){
    /* skip the non-tr nodes */
    if(n_trs[i_tr].nodeName==undefined ||
       n_trs[i_tr].nodeName.toLowerCase()!=tr) continue
    /* get the checkbox directly (quick and dirty without checks) */
    n_input = n_trs[i_tr].firstChild.firstChild
    if(n_input.checked==true){
      n_toRemove.push(n_trs[i_tr])

2. Open the page with firefox select AT LEAST TWO checkboxes and click remove

Look at the code the buffer is initialised to 60 characters. However only the first character is ever written to so the randomness is continually initialised by just one random character. Also rather than initialising with the full length of the buffer sizeof is used which merely returns the length of the buffer's pointer.

I'm a little confused as to why PK11_RandomUpdate is called inside the while loop too. Is there some significance to this or would it just be more sensible to fill the buffer with characters once and then call it with them all?",13,"0"

since I can't find it when I search for bugs I'ved submitted.

Since Pitchforkmedia.com recently revamped their site and since it is still
rendering completely incorrectly in Mozilla (0.9.9 - 2002031104 Win98) I'm
submitting a bug.

A lot of it seems to be css related...

in index.html we see
 

And looking through style.css we see some pretty simple stuff.  For example:
A:link { color: BLACK text-decoration: none }

And yet on the main page of the site it is very clear that every link is blue
and clearly underlined.

in div.bluebox we see that all of the separate text boxes around information on
the main page (news reviews interviews etc) are supposed to contain amongst
other features a 1px black border.  And sure enough there is no such black
border on the front page.

Other small annoyances that I can't pinpoint to specific css without spending a
bit more time looking it over include the gaps between the images for news 
reviews etc. on the main page and the block of text they represent.

I fooled around with NS4 and this page last night and while it wasn't getting
the css perfect it was at least making the links BLACK which I think is
definately better than how Mozilla 0.9.9 is handling this page.  IE5 and IE6
render this page as it is intended (so I imagine this page was made with that
browser in mind) but I can't figure out why all the css is being ignored.

Hopefully I didn't miss something obvious and this is simply a mistake on their

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.6a1 (20051213) and earlier

Fields in the query string of URIs are meant to be %-escaped. So the following mailto-URL works as expected when passed into TB from a browser (both IE and Mozilla):

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?to=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org and c&d@e.org)

Substituting the to by cc in the query string also still works:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?cc=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with cc to c&d@e.org)

However using bcc in the query string results in trouble:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org

This now gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

In other words TB forgets to unescape the BCC address(es) correctly. Note that leaving the addresses in the query string unescaped is not an option as the unescaped ampersand would prematurely terminate the to/cc/bcc field.  

Outlook behaves correctly in this respect i.e. treats all the above URIs correctly and on the same footing. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure TB as default mail application for IE or Mozilla
2. Enter mailto URL mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org into browser address field or click on a link with this URL 
3. Observe addresses shown in TB mail composer window - the BCC addresses will not be unescaped.

Actual Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

Expected Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c&d@e.org

This was first discovered in TB 1.0.7 but seems to be the same in the current trunk. Both Mozilla and IE were used as the browsers supplying the mailto-URI to TB. Mozilla in cooperation with Outlook handles the URIs correctly. The problem also occurs when the window.location property is set to the said mailto-URL in JavaScript in the browser.

The addition of the new 'mini' calendar is a great idea but unless it can

very limited. After all the dates it is showing can already be seen in the main

4. maybe this depands on what protocol we use...

We should try each IP adress until we find one which works and then remember

Split out from bug 646359.

On the other hand I think we were dirtying lines too often in ResolveParagraph (which covered up the fact that we weren't doing it when we should) so the rest of the patch moves the dirtying to points where we are changing or creating continuations.

"CORE-514110","nanojit: avoid getresv() because it has a redundant test","Created attachment 398068
patch

We see this pattern a lot in the Assembler:

    Reservation* resv = getresv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

getresv() is inlined so it becomes this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

In optimised builds the assert is removed:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

The r->used test should always succeed (if it doesn't there's a bug which
a debug build should catch).

This patch removes all occurrences of this idiom in Assembler.cpp and
Nativei386.cpp (but not the other back-ends) replacing them with this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv->used)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

thus avoiding the unnecessary test.  (A couple of the modified places didn't have the assertion but the code relied on resv->used being true.)

Furthermore I introduced resvUsed() which does the assert itself so now 
you actually see this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resvUsed(ins)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

I also changed other resv = getresv(ins)... if (resv) occurrences to 
resv = ins->resv()... if (resv->used) for consistency and readability.

I've run SS several times and am seeing a 0--3ms speedup.  I also checked

A child window is opened using Javascript window.open(). When this window is closed using either the OS'es red X button or call to Javascript self.close().  This is not universally true -- some factor in the test code (in the example URL) is doubtless responsible.  (I will be spending some time isolating this factor -- it's killing my app and I want it to stop!)

BTW: I've tested this with Windows and it does not cause crash.

"CORE-505158","Resource selection/fetch algorithm fails when container has unsupported data format","
  
  

Because Wave is a supported container resource selection algorithm passes this file to the Wave decoder which subsequently fails because the Wave contains MP3 data.

According to the spec we should try the next source and successfully select win_with_vorbis.ogg in this case:

Resource fetch algorithm step 3:
If the media data can be fetched but is found by inspection to be in an unsupported format or can otherwise not be rendered at all:

   1. The user agent should cancel the fetching process.
   2. Abort this subalgorithm returning to the resource selection algorithm.

As these steps do not abort the resource selection algorithm the following steps from step 4 of the Resource selection algorithm should execute:

  5. Run the resource fetch algorithm with the absolute URL that resulted from
      resolving the URL given by the candidate element's src attribute relative 
      to candidate. If that algorithm returns without aborting this one then
      the load failed.
   6. Queue a task to fire a simple event called error at the candidate element.
   7. Return to the step labeled search loop.

why would this be good?
if you use the multiweek view and have one or two passed weeks in your view
there is no good way to have the events pane to show the events from those
weeks. choosing All Events is to much but choosing any other view does not
help much if you need the last few weeks events for reference.

It does this by listening for special events and vetting the source against the authorized host list.

The whitelisting intends to allow subdomains of the whitelisted host but does not check that a separating dot exists that would ensure the originating host is a subdomain rather than merely a superstring of the authorized hostname. That is evilpersonas.com and fakepersonas.com etc. can change your persona. It would be easy for some joker to register such a domain and then host persona-changing invisible iframes on various (hacked?) sites.

The solution appears to be to check that the event source is an exact match for an authorized domain or substring matches the authorized domain plus a leading dot. You may want to consider requiring the authorized host list to be explicit about allowed subdomains through a wildcard syntax or maybe an optional leading dot as with cookie domains.

It's more annoying than an exploit from a quick glance it appears you can only select from personas that exist in the official gallery.

Bugzilla allows you to have multiple skins. These are custom CSS and possibly also custom images for Bugzilla. To create a new custom skin you have two choices:

* Make a single CSS file and put it in the skins/contrib directory.
* Make a directory that contains all the same CSS file names as skins/standard/
  and put your directory in skins/contrib/.

After you put the file or the directory there make sure to run checksetup.pl so that it can reset the file permissions correctly.

After you have installed the new skin it will show up as an option in the user's General Preferences. If you would like to force a particular skin on all users just select it in the Default Preferences and then uncheck Enabled on the preference.",33,"0"

2. Move the mouse left or right to another folder.

The other folder should open but it doesn't.

A couple of things to note: 

You can get the other folders to open automatically but what you do is move the mouse over the opened menupopup then move it straight onto the other folder toolbarbutton at which point it will open.

On a places bookmark build the result is slightly different. You cannot get the other folders to open automatically but moving the mouse over the other folders will at least highlight the toolbarbutton visually. I am unsure though if the places toolbar has the auto-open code for folders though.

One example would be retrieving a bug using Bug.get if you pass a single bug id as a scalar for the 'ids' param when it is expecting a list you get the following error to the client:

Can't use string (1) as an ARRAY ref while strict refs in use at /var/www/html/bugzilla/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.pm line 151

All WebService methods should either automatically convert a single value to a list before trying to access as list or throw error to the client stating that it only accepts values in the form of lists. These instead of throwing a code
error.

I believe it should automatically convert the values to lists and then just do the right thing. What do others think?

When dynamically setting the clip regions of a HTML element the element sometimes isn't shown completely. The change of the clipping regions is done by an interval to have some simple animation effect.

The problem seems to depend on garbage collection this way:
I create complex html:body content dynamically using javascript holding a lot of references to JavaScript objects and back to the DOM elements. I remove all those elements and create others again. Removing and recreating is one step. The clipping animation immidiately starts after such a step. The animation often
hang and is sometimes not rendered completely although the css properties are set correctly. Moving other windows over the incompletely rendered object shows that it's there but not fully redrawn.

My guess is that GC runs after the page recreation step pausing further execution and also timers or at least redrawing. If GC starts before the animation is finished and stops after the animation step in between is not rendered.

"CORE-456122","Don't fail offline cache updates for non-explicit items","Created attachment 339525
v1

The current spec/implementation of the offline spec requires that any failed load during a cache update should cause the entire application cache update to fail.

This could leave to serious problems if the author changes the application layout on the server - any opportunistically or dynamically cached items that were moved away will permanently prevent updates.

Attached patch changes this as proposed on the whatwg list - only updates to items explicitly listed in the manifest (CACHE: uris and fallback entries) will cause the entire update to fail.",30,"0"
