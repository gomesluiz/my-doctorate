(Full trace at https://launchpadlibrarian.net/86784583/Stacktrace.txt but this is the essential part).

This happens when adding a new device particular with devices which bounce a bit (i. e. you get several adds removes and changes before it stabilizes).

Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this myself with the devices I have but a colleague of mine (Sebastien Bacher) can reproduce it very easily with his iPod.

After a few rounds of debugging I now understand what happens:

This seems to be related to media polling (we verified both in-kernel and udisks based polling trigger this and cause the same uevents).

Correlating udev events and the corresponding udev debug output we get:

UDEV [26112.066235] remove /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.4/2-1.4:1.0/host29/target29:0:0/29:

Now we get a rather weird change uevent with a hilariously broken device path and device name at a time when sdb is already gone!

So I think the problem is that the media polling for the /sdb device creates a device in udisks.

I tried for two hours to reproduce this using scsi_debug (ptype=5 for CD-ROM or the default fake hard disk with faking media polling) but without success. I'd like to write a test case for this but for this to work we need to add the possibility of adding/removing media to scsi_debug. So for now we are stuck with real hw testing.",10,"0"

In some cases this handler doesn't actually get the channel. From the looks of it this happend because MC starts dispatching the channel before it has finished introspecting the recently popped up handler which means that it's unaware of the specific filter and ignores the preferred handler.

Two potential solutions for this:

"LIBREOFFICE-66145","Turning off 'Same content on first page' does not reflect in UI","Problem description: 
When creating a new document in LO (or opening an existing one) - if you go to the 'Page Style' configuration and go to the 'Header' tab and uncheck the 'Same content on first page' - you expect to be able to edit the first page's header different than other pages' headers. but in fact - they still edit together.
However when saving the file and reopening it - you see different headers. so this is a UI bug.

THIS IS A REGRESSION BUG (it worked in version 4.0).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Writer (new document)
2. Make sure you have 3 pages at least.
3. Turn off 'Same content for first page' in the 'Header' configuration.
4. Edit the header of the 1st page (it will show in other pages too - bug).
5. Edit the header of the 2nd\3rd page (it will show in the header of the first page too - bug).

Current behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the headers of all pages are still 'linked' and edit together.

Expected behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the header of the 1st page should be independent from the headers of the rest of the pages.

"MESA-90902","[bsw][regression] dEQP: Found invalid pixel values","Hardware: BSW RVP

Bug detailed description
=======
The following drawElements tests appear to have regressed between Mesa 10.5.0 and 10.6.0:
- dEQP-GLES3.functional.rasterization.fbo.rbo_multisample_4.interpolation.lines_wide
- dEQP-GLES3.functional.rasterization.fbo.rbo_multisample_max.interpolation.lines_wide

Cases where the test passed:
- ChromeOS on BSW w/ mid-November commit of Mesa (on platforms Haswell Baytrail Broadwell and Braswell - not sure of the commit on this)
- ChromeOS w/ mesa commit we were trying to move to (c2a0600 i965: Don't set NirOptions for stages that will use the vec4 backend.) on platforms Haswell Baytrail Broadwell - possible BSW-only regression

Cases where the test failed:
- ChromeOS build (bsw system) from current Google upstream tree (same mid-November Mesa commit)
- Upstream Linux (bsw system) using Mesa commit from 2014-11-24 commit ID: c88385603ae8d983314b736a9459bbf7d002cf11
- ChromeOS build (bsw system) w/ mesa commit we were trying to move to (c2a0600 i965: Don't set NirOptions for stages that will use the vec4 backend.)
- Upstream Linux (bsw system) using the mesa commit we were trying to move to
- Upstream Linux (bsw system) using current ToT mesa (as of 5/20/15)

Reproduce Steps
==============
1. Run indicated drawElements test with indicated version of Mesa or ToT Mesa
2. Compare test results against older (mid-November) Mesa commit

Expected Result
=============
- No failure with current ToT Mesa

Actual Result
===========
- 129 invalid pixel(s) found

It seems like one of the X11 upgrades changed to produce the key code 178
for the XF86WWW key. This maps to symbol I32 and thus using the cymotion
layout I don't get my mapped action for that key anymore. The cymotion
layout currently uses I02 for XF86WWW.

 > From Michael Goth
the following patch for /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet makes all keys 
work for me. I also deleted one XF86Standby mapping which I couldn't 
produce on my keyboard.

Patch to fix autotools

The cross-compile support for autotools in dbus is currently broken. It uses the target machine definition to check on which system the compiled code is going to run on while this definition is reserved for compilers and other tools that produce or execute machine code.

The attached patch fixes this by replacing the references to target with host. For a complete explanation of what the problem is pleas see the post I left as URL.

Hi

i have a funny and quite annoying problem. Im not even sure but it seems its got to do with the video driver. It happens randomly after coming back from suspend to ram (im kind of sure of this). First of all i notice some kind of quick flips that happen once every few minutes... then sometimes the screen just goes full pink or blue or black (i got all these colors but i guess there can be more!) and stays like that even if I remote-kill Xorg or switch to level 3. Everythings seems to work under it (i can ssh etc) but there's no way to get rid of it.

The problem has appeared after upgrading kernel to latest development version (2.6.33-rcX) and the Xorg drivers with it. Before that i was using an older kernel with modesetting disabled older drivers. My computer model is listed in intel_lvds.c as one of those not reporting lid status properly. I have a 945GME intel card. I have attached the xorg.0.log since it has information about all driver versions etc...

"XORG-8085","gconf plugin breaks action options by writing but not reading them as a single entity","The most-often encountered manifestation of this bug is this:
If you change the setting of both the key and the edge activating an action the
edge setting is reset to the default (the value set up during the initialization
of the corresponding plugin) when compiz restarts.

This bug has been discussed in several topics of compiz.net forums because it
manifests itself by breaking settings of several plugins. One of the discussions
(http://www.compiz.net/topic-2091-1.html) contains steps to reproduce the bug
with the scale plugin (http://www.compiz.net/viewtopic.php?pid=28158#p28158).
The bug has been reported analyzed and two solutions (a long-term one and a
transitional one) has been proposed in compiz.net bugtracker at
http://bugs.compiz.net/view.php?id=44 . A copy some bits from there follows:

________
ulph's analysis of the issue:

When gconfInitOption is called for an option of type CompOptionTypeAction there
are four calls to gconfGetOptionValue with the entries for key button bell and
edge (in that order). Suppose gconfGetOptionValue is called for the key entry
and that the key entry is set in gconf. Now gconfGetOptionValue will locate the
data structure for the action. This data structure holds the configuration for
both key button bell and edge. Next gconfGetOptionValue will update the data
structure to reflect the key configuration for that action. Finally it will call
gconfSetDisplayOptionForPlugin that will notify the plugin of the change and
write back the action to gconf with gconfSetOption. Since gconfSetOption writes
back the entire action data structure to gconf the button bell and edge keys
that haven't been read into our action data structure yet will be overwritten.

________
ulph's long-term proposal

I propose that the gconf-structure should be changed so that actions are in
separate directories where all entries are read (and written) at once. That way
it would be easy to distinguish an action from some other key. The current way
that actions are retreived from gconf is kind of awkward. Also this problem
would be easier to resolve. Do you think this is a good idea?

________
My (crankyjack's) transitional proposal

Putting [actions] into separate directories is logical plus it will make [them]
look much neater in gconf-editor. The trouble is that this change is almost as
big as the move to the action system was. It will break current settings and
requires new gconf schemas. So Plan B would be to change gconfGetOptionValue
so that it loads the four action options together. The change could be done as
follows:

    1. Move the ugly heuristics which determines plugin and option name in
lines 387--473 of gconfGetOptionValue to gconfKeyChanged.

    2. Merge gconfInitOption and the remainder of gconfGetOptionValue into a new
function gconfGetOption. It should take the same arguments as gconfInitOption
and load actions as a single entity. The function will have to synthesize the
gconf path to keys (the initial part of gconfInitOption) and call

    3. Call the new gconfGetOption from gconfKeyChanged and replace calls to
gconfInitOption with gconfGetOption.

I think this makes sense because gconfGetOption will do what its name says and
will better mirror gconfSetOption. What it does in the current state is better
described as gconfGetKey. Moreover the function will not change much when
(later) actions will get separate gconf directories.",390,"1"

Attached you can find an archive that contains several sample files that can be used to reproduce the problem.
The files were generated by fuzzing valid files in order to check for problems when libreoffice handles malformed input.
The bug was found while testing Libreoffice version 4.0.1.2 but it is persistent in version 4.1.2.3

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open libreoffice with gdb attached
2. Open the files from the attached archive

patch against poppler cloned from git on 4Mar12

The size of arrays with image data changed from using outerSize to size.
For example when I compare pdftops output-pdftopsbug.pdf (my test file for slanted text) I get sequences like the one below where the 1 array dup is from 0.18.4 and the  array dup is from a git clone from 4Mar12.
Since the 0.18.4 version works I think that the larger allocation is unnecessary and might cause problems by wasting memory in the postscript interpreter.

dmesg with new_pll=1

Latest drm-radeon-testing kernel (1 feb 2010) as soon as KMS kicks in with the new_pll algo the LVDS picture shows some kind of ripple effect as if something was slightly wrong with the refresh rate. Kind of hard to describe..
The effect persists even when starting X. Changing screen resolution doesn't help. The new_pll has never worked for me since its introduction back in december (took me a while to find out it was the culprit). Booting with radeon.new_pll=0 gives me a perfectly usable system.

On a side probably unrelated note I can't help but notice that the kernel (both the working and the non-working versions) finds an HDMI port but unless I'm becoming blind my notebook has no HDMI out .. hm.",15,"0"

but am getting desperate to fix the problem so am entering it here too.

When I try to start the xserver using the vesa driver on my toshiba R100 with
Trident CyberBlade XP4m32 graphics card X takes up 100% of the CPU. The last
entry in Xorg.0.log is:

(II) VESA(0): Splitting WC range: base: 0xffffffff size: 0x2000000

The logs and the lspci output are attached to the ubuntu bug.

I've searched google and the xorg bugzilla extensively but not found anything
similar.

The vesa driver does appear to work on Fedora core 6 (with the same version of
X: 7.1.1) so perhaps this is an issue with Ubuntu's packaging or upgrade
procedure. Still I feel that X should give a meaningful error and abort rather
than hanging partway through.

Any suggestions about what to try would be much appreciated.",698,"1"

example of Gnome Terminal being corrupted by an xmgrace window

After the most recent upgrade (Xorg.log reports 1.7.7 and older version is 
1.7.4).  I have noticed corruption of gnome-terminal xfce4 terminal 
konsole ksnapshot and rhythmbox windows when passed over the vertical and 
horizontal edges of certain GUI programs.  It is likely that there are 
many more which show this effect.  The problem does not always occur the 
same way for every offending GUI window sometimes it is only vertical 
lines sometimes it is both horizontal and vertical lines.  The offending 
programs for which I have noticed this effect so far are xfig xmgrace 
(grace) and xpaint.  I am sure that there are others but tgif and 
iceweasel in particular do not show this effect.

Refreshing the terminal window moving to another desktop and then back 
again restores the uncorrupted windows although just refreshing a terminal 
window will not clean up the window menu area which remains corrupt until 
the desktop is switched.  Passing another terminal window also cleans up 
most of the corrupted area except any portions lying on top of the 
offending program's window edges.

The effect is also present in the subwindows of the xmgrace program and 
this is quite problematic and makes xmgrace almost unusable.

I have noticed this on my Thinkpad T60 system with the Intel 945 graphics 
card running both in 64 bit and 32 bit modes. I downgraded to version of 2.9.1 of the driver and the corruption problem disappears.  This problem seems to occur with all recent kernels.

I am running xfce4 4.6.2 as a window manager.  I have not tried this with gnome or kde however the bug has been confirmed by other users.  Please see Debian bug #596781 at

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=596781

I am attaching a screenshot of the type of corruption typical when 
gnome-terminal is passed over the corner of an xmgrace window.  The xorg.log below is from the Debian bug report of September 13 when I was using an older kernel.

Cheers

2. 'Find' - Search Term openoffice - 
3. click on 'Über digitale Signaturen` and pull down to `
Signaturen und Softwareversionen` There you read 'Ab OpenOffice.org 3.2 und StarOffice 9.2 werden alle Elemente mit Ausnahme der Signatur selbst (META-INF/documentsignatures.xml) signiert.'

This text is correct but it applies to LibreOffice also. In general this text refers to OpenOffice more than is should as it could deliver the same information referring to LibreOffice. The exact text at least should be amended to LibO.

I guess it's the same in other languages but I don't know how to test that.

"WAYLAND-103282","XWayland refresh rate locked to 60 Hz","Looks like xwayland doesn't report the correct refresh rate/vsync timings(?) to clients. I've been working around compositor implementation flaws by using a custom EDID file. Now the compositors I've tried (Mutter KWin Sway) run at the correct 144 Hz however xwayland clients still only refresh at 60 Hz.

This is bad because if using a monitor with no even multiple of 60 Hz (like 72 75 or 144 Hz monitors) there is stutter instead of smooth playback. And I guess many common apps will be running through xwayland for quite some time.

I can also confirm the problem running glxgears which runs v-synced and prints 60 FPS to the console.",232,"0"
"SYNCEVOLUTION-52669","asynchronous + batched item changes","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-11-08 15:53:42 +0000 ----

When making changes to a backend (deleting/updating/adding items) the result (success/failure + item ID + change tracking information) is expected right away. That prevents interleaving execution of the change and processing the next item and batching of multiple changes.

This is bad for performance when the backend needs to talk to some remote resource (CalDAV/CardDAV server ActiveSync).

It might be possible to address this by using the delayed item ID resolution mechanism in libsynthesis. All the intermediate layers (TrackingSyncSource MappingSyncSource APIs) also need to be changed. Finally the backends must be changed to take advantage of this.

The first candidate for this is the ActiveSync backend where batching changes would result in a considerable reduction of total sync runtime because of less network roundtrips.

It's a Thinkpad T60p in a docking station.  The Doublesight DS-240WB external monitor is detected OK if I use the VGA port it flickers on X start but is not detected using the DVI port.  (and the image quality is indeed much nicer with dvi!).

The monitor on dvi worked just fine with yesterday's F-7/fglrx installation and still does in console mode and windows XP.  Something about radeonhd's EDID query  is failing and trying the suggested HPD swap does not help.  Will attach logfiles in both cases.  Can knowing the EDID block from the VGA case somehow let me force the dvi case?

The T60p's built in panel works great though and in VGA mode all the dual screen fun I wish to try works just fine.",7,"0"

Note 'sri' should already exist Daniel Stone made it some time ago (maybe 8
months ago?)  So there should be no conflict.  But you can ask him all the same.

"XORG-11295","Intel XV textured video broken with framebuffer width >2048","When playing movies via mplayer the textured video adapter doesn't show any output however things work when the overlay adapter is selected.

In particular it seems related to DRI and EXA. If DRI is disabled and acceleration is via XAA there is no output through the textured adapter. However if either DRI is enabled *OR* EXA is used the textured adapter works. In my case I disabled/enabled DRI by changing the framebuffer size (through the Virtual keyword in xorg.conf). With a width >2048 the Intel driver disables DRI. 

To reproduce:

 1) Boot up X with DRI disabled and use XAA -- use a Virtual size with width of 2049 or greater and 'Option AccelMethod XAA'
 2) Play a movie via mplayer selecting the Textured adapter. Note that no output is produced (there is no blue overlay -- only a black window).
 3) Restart X this time with either DRI enabled or EXA enabled.
 4) Play a movie via mplayer selecting the Textured adapter. Note that output is produced.",1,"0"

Is missing one of the most commonly needed extend modes - using the
nearest pixel within the image. A common usage of this is when you
want to scale an image with a hard edge but with filtering of its
contents. EXTEND_NONE fuzzes out the edges.

[Problem]
Crash on HP Envy 14 with discrete ATI card and i5 integrated graphics.  Possibly due to a bad interaction between radeon and other framebuffer drivers.

[Original Description]
I'm running natty and every since the upgrade to 6.14.0 I've been unable to consistently boot.  After some discussion in the forums I tried repeatedly to boot into recovery mode.  In most cases I got a black screen.  One time though when I was able to successfully increase the brightness I saw some errors from the radeon module.

Is systemd trying to find out the unit of the notification sender but the sender (a forked systemd-notify) has already terminated?

Sometimes it even happens when the service is started so the READY message is lost.

I think this currently makes systemd-notify useless.

"MESA-88885","Transform feedback uses incorrect interleaving if a previous draw did not write gl_Position","Created attachment 112993
Reproducer

After a draw with a shader program that has transform feedback varyings set and has a geometry shader that does not write to gl_Position subsequent uses of transform feedback with interleaved transform feedback attributes can out write attributes in the wrong order or with some missing. In every case of this I've seen the space used for each vertex's attributes was correct but the offset within the vertex's data is wrong for some attributes.

The attached program demonstrates the problem. The second draw call writes three transform feedback attributes. They are a float a vec3 and another float. When the transform feedback buffer is read back the last component of the vec3 has the value that should have been written to the second float and the second float ends up with 0. The output is in the correct order if the first draw call is removed if the first draw's geometry shader is changed to write to gl_Position or if the geometry shader for the second draw writes only compile time constants to the transform feedback attributes.

I this bug is consistently reproducible for me. I am using Intel Haswell graphics x86_64 architecture with Fedora 21 and mesa git b930ef1ce8222156464cfd1e744c9598ace5efbb master branch. The Fedora 21 mesa 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 packages also reproduce the bug.",34,"0"

My libX11 is compiled with the xcb backend but cairo apparently uses xlib (even though I enabled the 'xcb' USE flag).
When I run gnome-terminal --sync without gdb xcb prints this after the normal libX11 error report this however doesn't happen when I run it in gdb:

"XORG-666","New XKB option for Tux keys: request for addition","Submitted by Daniel Elstner:

---

Basically the bottom row of my keyboard (which is just a standard pc105
model with three replaced caps) now looks like this:

           

In order to make the keyboard work as advertised on the key caps I need
to map the keys as follows:

     = Super_L
     = Alt_R Meta_R
     = Super_R

So I did just that by putting another option into symbols/altwin:

// Layout for Tux key caps with additional right Alt key
partial modifier_keys 
xkb_symbols alt_super_win {
    key  {        [       Alt_L  Meta_L          ]       }
    key  {        [       Alt_R  Meta_R          ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_L                 ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_R                 ]       }
    modifier_map Mod1   { Alt_L Alt_R Meta_L Meta_R }
    modifier_map Mod4   { Super_L Super_R }
}

Obviously I also need put this line into rules/xfree86:

altwin:alt_super_win    =       +altwin(alt_super_win)
 
And finally there's the description entry in rules/xfree86.xml.  The
description was a little hard to keep short since this option actually
sets up two modifier mappings.  However I'm not sure if splitting it
into separate options would actually be useful.  (This would require
adding another option group too since in this one multiple selections
are disallowed.)  Anyway here's the text:


  altwin:alt_super_win
  Alt is mapped to the right Win-key and Super to Menu.

 
If you look at the patch you'll see that I also changed two other option
entries in the XML file.  Those referred to option names which did not
exist looks very much just like a copy-n-paste mistake.",478,"1"

Problem description: 
Ž is a standard Czech character. But if I save text containing this character in RTF format and open the document again the text is mangled - usually an extra } character appears after Ž.

This problem only affects RTF format. In DOC or ODT everything works fine.

I have verified this problem on two different computers both running Fedora 18.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an empty document and save it as file.rtf. Close Writer. This step is necessary not sure why.
2. Open file.rtf and type in Ž. Save and close Writer.
3. Open file.rtf and see that it contains Ž} or similar.

Current behavior:
For every Ž an extra character is added sometimes replacing other character. For example Židenice can become Ž}denice.

Expected behavior:

This has been reproduced on a variety of KBL-Y and KBL-U SKUs and with both coreboot firmware and UEFI version KBLSE2R1. R00. X094. P02. 1706220744 on a KBL-Y RVP.

This was reproduced with chromeos-4.14 https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/9325afcd11534271/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/ and linux stable 4.15.1 tag

This is reproduced with maxcpus=1. 
Hardware video decoder is required to reproduce the issue.
Sysrq does not work after system freeze. ITP halt() fails to stop the CPUS.

The first reports came from a ChromeOS autotest which does the following:
1. Login as a test account
2. Play a vp9 or vp8 video for 10secs
3. restart ui (roughly equivalent to “service mydisplaymanager restart”)

Of course this test was initially not run with a mdelay() added in the kernel - which is why reproduction was extremely rare. It took weeks to narrow down the issue to that specific delay. 

To reproduce the issue manually (without running autotest) execute the below steps 
1) Play any video in 1080p from crosvideo.appspot.com
2) Monitor the i915_display_info to make sure the overlay plane is active.
3) Once overlay plane is active move the cursor on top of the overlay plane. This disables the overlay plane.
4) When the overlay plane is disabled the system freezes.",490,"1"

I have just installed LO-3.6.1.2 build on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit and saw the following scenario:

1. Double clicked the LO-3.6 icon.
2. Waited few second (10 or so) and nothing happened (no splash screen).
3. Double clicked the LO-3.6 icon once again.

Result: The following error message appeared on the screen see also the screenshot:

Few seconds later the splash screen appeared. It started to register the extensions and the application started.

So there were evidently running two instances. One of them failed and the other succeeded.


Possible explanation:
---------------------

The first instance was removing the huge bundled extensions directory before showing the splash screen => it looked like the application was not started => I started another instance => both instances started to remove the same files => one instance was slower and failed


Possible solution:
------------------

+ show splash earlier
+ earlier detect that another instance is running
+ ignore this

Note that we install many extensions by default and the cache is huge. So more users might be affected.",7,"0"

"XORG-4652","Xv + Silkenmouse = Lethal race condition","[From my mail to the xorg list slightly edited]

Silkenmouse means that the cursor update code (positioning view port panning)
is executed asynchronously ie it can interrupt on-going other operations of the
server.

xf86PointerMoved (pScrn->PointerMoved) is there to eventually pan the viewport.
So it is likely that pScrn->AdjustFrame is executed which is wrapped by Xv.

Xv's wrapper for AdjustFrame if the driver has not installed a
ReputImage function stops the video (by calling the driver's stopvideo
routine) and removes the port from the window (which is done in
RemovePortFromWindow()). This involves NULLifying the pointer to the
drawable in the Xv private structure.

However XVAdjustFrame does so only if the video is currently on
indicated by pPriv->IsOn == XV_ON. This is correct.

But what is not correct is that XvAdjustFrame() before calling
RemovePortFromWindow does not check if the pPriv->Draw is set.

So the condition under which XVAdjustFrame calls RemovePortFromWindow
is only that pPriv->IsOn = XV_ON.

PutImage on the other hand removes the port from the window every time
it is called. BUT: It does not set pPriv->IsOn to XV_OFF or XV_PENDING
(whatever would be correct haven't thought about this yet) at this point.

PutImage removes the port from the window (ie NULLifies the pointer to
the drawable) and proceeds doing its business without touching
pPriv->IsOn until the very end after the driver's PutImage() has been
called.

During the time between the RemovePortFromWindow() call and the near end
of PutImage the situation is that

- the portPriv->pDraw is NULL
- pPriv->isOn is eventually XV_ON from a previous call to PutImage().

If the silken mouse ie AdjustFrame interrupts PutImage during this
time it will see IsOn == XV_ON and therefore eventually call
RemovePortFromWindow with a NULL pDraw (= pWin). RemovePortFromWindow does no
NULL-check on its pWin argument so X gets a sig 11.

This discovery frightens me. Sure the easy way is to check for a NULL
pointer in XVAdjustFrame or - perhaps better - to add a pPriv->XV_xxx
after or before PutImage's call to RemovePortFromWindow. But this is
only a work-around for a more deeper problem.

Mildly put I am not sure that letting the driver's stopvideo()
interrupt an on-going PutImage() is safe in any case. 

An easy and quick fix would be inserting

    portPriv->IsOn = XV_OFF

before the call to xf86XVRemovePortFromWindow() in xf86XVPutImage. This
could also prevent a stopvideo interrupting an on-going Putimage(). But this
assumingly makes StopVideo choke and I am hardly convinced that this is a
long-term solution.

The long term solution is to make AdjustFrame be executed in the normal event
queue (as also Keith suggested). It does way too much nowadays to safely assume
it won't interphere with normal server operations.

I solved this by deferring AdjustFrame into the block handler in the sis driver
(not yet in CVS and won't in time for 6.9/7.0) but this really needs a global fix.",2185,"1"

    drm/i915: Parsing LFP brightness control from VBT

    LFP brighness control from the VBT block 43 indicates which
    controller is used for brightness.
    LFP1 brightness control method:
    Bit 7-4 = This field controller number of the brightnes controller.
    0 = Controller 0
    1 = Controller 1
    2 = Controller 2
    3 = Controller 3
    Others = Reserved
    Bits 3-0 = This field specifies the brightness control pin to be used on the
    platform.
    0 = PMIC pin is used for brightness control
    1 = LPSS PWM is used for brightness control
    2 = Display DDI is used for brightness control
    3 = CABC method to control brightness
    Others = Reserved

    Adding the above fields in dev_priv->vbt and corresponding changes in
    parse_backlight()

    v2: Jani's review comments addressed
        - Move PWM definitions to intel_bios.h
        - Moving vbt_version to intel_vbt_data
        - Rename brightness to bl_ctrl_data
        - Logging just control_pin instead of string
        - Avoid adding vbt_version in dev_priv
        - Since only DDI option is available as of now let control pin DDI
        affect dev_priv->vbt.backlight.present

    v3: Jani's review comments addressed
        - Drop control_pin
        - Use bdb->version
        - set controller to 0 instead of using control pin define
        - check controller bounds
        - remove superfluous changes in intel_parse_bios

"TELEPATHY-28866","ChannelRequest.I.Hints — let requesters pass metadata through to handlers","Currently there's no way to relay additional information between a channel requester and the ultimate observers and handlers of the resulting channel. The main use case for which this poses a problem is associating contact IDs (in particular phone numbers) with particular contacts in your address book. When I tell my N900 to call my mum how does the call UI know that I'm trying to call her and not my dad (who has the same phone number¹)? The current answer is that it can't.

So I have written a spec branch which adds:

• A new immutable property ChannelRequest.RequestMetadata: a{sv} defined to contain arbitrary metadata which clients MAY choose to interpret but MUST cope with the absence of [a]
• New methods on ChannelDispatcher to specify said metadata when making a channel request [b]
• A new key in ObserveChannels' Observer_Info dict containing immutable channel properties [c].

Handlers can already sign up to receive the immutable properties of channel requests by implementing Client.Interface.Requests.

So this allows the call UI to know who you're calling as well as any observers (perhaps a call logger?) assuming the various components know the format by which the platform-specific contact ID is included in the RequestMetadata. They have to be able to deal with it being missing — a third-party app might not specify this — but it allows this information to be passed if needed.

This could also be used to allow one process to request an outgoing file transfer channel to be handled by another process passing along the full path to the file to be sent which would allow nautilus-send-to's Telepathy plugin to delegate the actual file transferring to Empathy or vice-versa. Obviously this involves slightly more active collusion — you have to know that the handler will understand this key — but that's probably okay we can specify that and maybe have some mechanism to discover it.

"OPENCLIPART.ORG-4187","User registration / login / session mechanism for the website.","As mentioned in bug 4134 we need a mechanism that can let a user log in
and then track who is logged in (via a session cookie) and other bits of
information (in a database probably).

For the database we could either ask the fdo people to hook us up with
one in whatever RDBMS they use or we could go with DBD::Trini or SQLite
or something along those lines or in a pinch flat files.  Then we can
wrap a couple of easy Class::DBI classes around it and use it site-wide.

Basically what goes on conceptually is this:
1. Upon visiting the site initially the user will be anonymous
2. If the user logs in (by entering a username and password into
   a form that goes to a login cgi which checks against the db)
   then two things happen:
   2A:  A record is created in the DB in a sessions table that
        holds the user id possibly some other info (such as an
        IP address and expiration datetime) and a pseudorandom
        unique session ID string.
   3A:  The session ID string is sent to the user in a cookie.
3. Any page that wants to know if the user is logged in can check
   the cookie look up the session ID string in the database and
   get the user id from the record.  The user id is then also a key 
   into the users table and possibly some other tables.
4. A cron job can periodically delete expired sessions from the
   sessions table also when the user logs in the login script
   could clear out any old sessions from that user before
   adding the new one.
5. When a new user wants to create an account we ask them for
   (among other things) an email address and the account is
   created with an inactive status and a datestamp and an email
   is sent to the provided address containing a magic token
   which is also stored in the newly created user record.
   The user retrieves the email and feeds the magic token from
   it into the account-activation form proving the address is 
   valid and the account is then activated so that the user
   can log in.  A captcha could also be employed if we have
   problems with bogus accounts but I suspect that will not
   be necessary at least for now.

The advantage of getting an RDBMS account is that PHP portions of the site
could also access it whereas with something like Trini that would be
rather harder to do directly.

Ways this would be used on the site are many and varied but some examples:
 * The upload clipart form could auto-prefill the author portions
   (both author name and URI) the user would still be able to edit 
   the values before submitting.
 * If we offer a choice of stylesheets we can store the user's preference
   and always use it when the user logs in.  We could also store preferences
   for other things such as which sidebar sections to show and stuff.
 * When the DMS is in place we can make it so that logged-in users
   can update their own clipart and/or its metadata.
 * Also with the DMS in place we can make it so that users can leave
   feedback about specific items of clipart anyone would be able to
   view this feedback and the author can be notified next time he logs
   in.  Private feedback for just the author is also a possibility
   if that is a desired feature.
 * With the DMS in place we can add an interface whereby users can 
   help with categorization and a given user's contributions in this 
   regard can be tracked so that if a vandalism problem develops they 
   can be reverted.",380,"1"

is clearly not the place where it should be.

Based on that observation we would like to build an OpenIM initiative.

FcFreeTypeQueryFace currently sorts family names so that

FcGetDefaultObjectLangIndex then (effectively) reorders this list so that the
first in the list has a language close to FcGetDefaultLang().

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/commit/?id=904426816df300fad816238f0f27ef595a6a539b

This works mostly as expected except when FcGetDefaultLang() does not exactly
match any of the family name languages.

"XORG-7364","'RenderBadGlyphSet (invalid GlyphSet parameter)' error on PPC64 with gtk applications","Hello

on PPC64 (most?) gtk applications crash on startup with the following error 
(for example the news reader pan):

The program 'pan' received an X Window System error. 
This probably reflects a bug in the program. 
The error was 'RenderBadGlyphSet (invalid GlyphSet parameter)'. 
  (Details: serial 2041 error_code 182 request_code 154 minor_code 23) 
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously 
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it. 
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line 
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful 
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.) 


this would be a workaround:

Michel Dänzer pointed out that 'typedef unsigned long GlyphSet' isn't the same
size on 32/64 bit architectures so either the Render protocol or server code
isn't 32/64 clean.

I've been using X.org 6.8 with evdev mouse driver (hacked into X.org by gentoo)
for a while along with the evrouter program to manage extra buttons on my MS
Wireless Explorer mouse. This program monitors /dev/input/event_usb
(udev-created link to this mouse's evdev interface) and does specified actions
(simulates key presses) when extra mouse buttons are pressed.

All this worked fined until I installed X.org 7.0.

When I run X the mouse works fine but evrouter no longer works. Apparently X
somehow gets exclusive access to /dev/input/event_usb because even cat
/dev/input/event_usb produces absolutely no output when I move my mouse / press
any buttons on it. So evrouter doesn't read any mouse events from
/dev/input/event_usb.

This only pertains to the evdev mouse driver my trackpoint (handled by regular
mouse driver) produces output when I cat /dev/input/event_trackpoint.

"XORG-51955","Sticky+LatchLock fails as of Ubuntu 12.04 (1.11.3)","Pressing a modifier key twice should 'lock' the key so that all subsequent key presses automagically become [mod]+[key] this has worked as far back as Hardy Heron but breaks in Precise Pangolin.

e.g. Shift Shift abc123 should equal ABC!@# instead of abc123.

The xkbwatch tool from x11-xkb-utils is the best way to see this--it shows that no modifier key can ever reach the locked state.  This is a huge deal for people with mobility impairments who type with one finger a pen or like me a mouthstick.

XKB is the sole reason I was able to switch from Windows to Linux it is very critical to my daily use.  (Emacs is horrible without being able to lock modifier keys.)",634,"1"

Id like to be added to the x.org/xf86-video-ati project so that I can commit directly to xf86-video-ati. Ive been contributing patches for AGP quirks and other stuff via bugzilla and Alex asked that I commit quirks directly.  (I will probably continue to post more significant patches to bugzilla.)

 So i can reproduce it today too on 32bit (64bit is not affected at least not by corruption) drm-next-3.18 kernel 3.17.rc7 current mesa git and reverted this:

 http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2014-August/066746.html

 For the mesa part i already bisected that it starts at (might be same reason as bug 83436 but let alone that one for now):

 http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=07c65b85eada8dd34019763b6e82ed4257a9b4a6

 For the kernel part not bisected yet but it is somewhere in between 3.16 and 3.17-rc1 so hopefully i will bisect that maybe today :)",303,"0"

"DRI-36048","[965GM] Resume ends with plasma effect","It's now a big lottery to 'suspend/resume' my Lenovo T61 GMA965 - this problem is quite longterm - it happened from time to time in the past but disabling drm_kms_helper thread seemed to minimize it.

However now with kernel 2.6.39-rcX - it strikes back with full power - nothing seems to help - and it's like 1 from 3-4 resumes ends with plasma effect on resume -  when this happens - the only way to have the laptop usable is to make a full reboot - machine seems to work OK - but without display it's not really useful.

I'm attaching phone video grab of such plasma effect.

Recently there are some extra warnings in the message log - but they are probably unrelated to real cause - they are just side effect - when I tried after such broken resume to suspend machine again.

So here is the log from 'resume -> (plasma) -> suspend -> resume...'

"LIBREOFFICE-73165","inline spellchecking waits for typing pauses before redlining errors","Hello

I have been using LibreOffice for years on Linux. I have recently noticed that spellchecking has become terribly slow. I am using Libreoffice 4.1.4.2 on Arch Linux on a fast Intel Core I5 laptop and I've never seen spellchecking this slow. It usually takes at least 1 second after hitting the spacebar after a misspelled word before it shows up with a red underline. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds or more. By this time I have usually typed far beyond that word and don't notice it anymore. This slowness occurs with both English and Spanish spellchecking and I imagine the other languages are the same. I can also confirm that on Firefox the built in spellchecking (which I believe uses the same engine?) is instantaneous and reliable. I can't really say when exactly this regression happened but a few months ago I don't think it was this bad on whatever the current LibO version was at that time.

Thanks for looking into this.

Problem description: 
Open the attached docx file containg Object:Icon . Export the docx file using LO. The DrawAspect is not getting preserved.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached docx file which will have OLEObject with DrawAspect=Icon
2. Export the file in docx file format.
3. Open the exported file in MS-Office and double click on the object Icon. The object doesn't open the ppt associated with it. Because DrawAspect=Icon property of the OLEObject is not getting prserved.

Current behavior:
The DrawAspect=Content property is getting exported as Content is the hard code value.

Expected behavior:
DrawAspect=Icon should be preserved.

It should be possible to add annotation/comment on multiple paragraph text range. According to ODF 1.2 I don't see any technical restriction not to support it.

odp file and in slide 4 some lines that cause the crash

Having drawn a line on a slide and selecting that line but releasing the left button one gets a line with two light blue squares at the ends. When hoovering the mouse on the line the mouse pointer changes into a hand. Pressing down the left button holding it down one can move the line around. However sometimes when pressing the left mouse button the mouse pointer changes in a gray square. After releasing the button LibreOffice crashes. I have the impression that this happens when the mouse pointer is a little bit off the line. It is reproducible within a few minutes.

Currently the attached odp file makes it reproducible. Select the lowest line in slide 4 so the light blue squares appear move the mouse pointer over the line so the hand appears and press the left button. Now the gray square appears and after the release of the button the crash is there.
One can prevent the crash by moving the mouse pointer to an area where it changes in the black circle with the slash in it and release the button.",355,"0"

The difference to the ~2 weeks older kernel was 100% reproducable by just doing:

- boot to console (no start of X11 required) and login as root
- echo mem >/sys/power/state
- wait till power LED blinks
- press some key to wake up the system
- observe no display output and no reaction to anything

GPU is a RX 460 CPU a Ryzen R7 1800X board Asus X370 Pro connected is one 4k display via HDMI 2.0.

After this I went back to the current HEAD of amd-staging-drm-next and (manually) reverted only commit 7ae4acd21e9e264afb079e23d43bcf2238c7dbea and this indeed results in a kernel that works fine with regards to resuming from S3 sleep.

Pivoting my finger around the tip but not getting appropriate precise cursor movement

With the patch from https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90735 trackpad cursor movement is much improved for fast and medium-speed movements. But it's still sluggish and imprecise for very slow movements. To move the cursor 5-10 pixels should ideally be accomplishable with very subtle precise finger movement--such as pivoting your finger around the very tip without actually moving the tip. Pivoting your finger like this right now generally results in no cursor movement at all or jerky erratic movement.

I've attached an evemu recording of me pivoting my finger around its tip expecting to get very precise cursor movement but instead getting either nothing or erratic jerky movements.",547,"1"

4. Enter a name eg. test for a new autotext entry and a shortcut. You may leave the automatic shortcut which was generated (t) as is.

6. A new autotext entry will show up in My Autotext category. Select it.
7. Press the Autotext button again and choose Change name
8. A new window will show up. In the two lower boxes write the name to which you want to change the name of the new entry. The crash will happen immediately after you hit OK if and only if the new shortcut will be identical (case insensitive) with the old one.

Ps.: I'm using polish locale so i'm not sure about the exact menu item's names in english. I guess you'll figure it out.

kernel dmesg log & NVDABMP FCODE ROM

Hi

When running a Powermac 11.2 (G5 Quad - powerpc64) with a Quadro FX4500 (NV47) previous kernels had no issue extracting the FCODE ROM / DCB block via the OpenFirmware device tree.
Last vanilla kernel that i have compiled that seemed to work fine was kernel 3.18.16.
Normally it will find the BIT SIGNATURE via OpenFirmware method.

However when compiling a newer vanilla kernel 4.1.2 nouveau seems to have an issue reading the FCODE ROM / DCB block / from the OpenFirmware device tree.
Also interestingly this time around it attempts to use the PROM method and attempts to find the BIT SIGNATURE via this method.
Apparently it found a signature but looks like garbage and seems like it cant extract the DCB BLOCK.

As instructed i have attached a dmesg.log along with a dump of the NVDABMP image out of the following folder: /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/pci@0f0000000/NVDAParent@0/.

Not sure if this is correct but i have passed the following nouveau module options as i understood:

options nouveau config=NvMSI=0debug=debugVBIOS=trace

I have placed the kernel dmesg log along with the NVDABMP dump in the attached nouveau_powerpc64_pmac11.2.tar.xz archive.

Please let me know if there is any more info required.

Thanks for your help!

Test file

The RAND() function of Calc was fixed on bug 33365. Yet the same bug is present with the Rnd random number generation function of BASIC as well.

Even with as few records as 1000 the random numbers repeat themselves several times. Test document (ODS) with test macro attached.

TEST PROCEDURE:
1. Open the attached document
2. Click the Generate button to (re-)generate 1000 numbers. Wait for Generation Status to change from Started... to Ready


EXPECTED RESULTS:
2. Cell D1 shows 1.00000000 (i.e. no repetition of values in the B column)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
2. Value of D1 always bigger than 1.00000000 (between 1.02200000 and 1.04400000 on just a few tests) due to many repeated values in the B column. (Column C shows how many times a number is repeated.)


WinXP Home 32 bit LO 4.0.5.2 release


NOTES:
- The issue does not occur on with the test file attached to bug 33365 which tests the RAND() function of Calc. To achieve comparable results my attached file is based on that file and uses the same evaluation methods.

- Usage of the Randomize generator initialization function before the first Rnd usage does not work around the problem.

- Calc RAND() fix commit http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=8450a99c744e9005f19173e4df35d65640bcf5c4 says that seed() initialises the state of the global random number generator and it should only be called once at the start of the main programme. So maybe the latter information should be added to the description of the Randomize function in LO help. Because according to that information additional later seeding of the random number generator would make it loose the entropy it has accumulated so far.

"XORG-6026","XDM: Segfault in netaddr.c:ConvertAddr","It is possible for the ifa_addr field of an ifaddrs struct to be NULL (for
example in the case that the ifaddrs struct corresponds to a pppX interface).

This causes a segfault in the child process forked by session.c:StartClient. The
result is that after a user attempts to login the screen goes black and then
goes back to the XDM login screen because the segfault only takes down the child
process that would have started the user's session.

Below is a patch against xdm-X11R7.0-1.0.1 to fix the segfault.

Pls see original report

I found that with LibreOffice 3.4.0RC1  – WIN7  Home Premium  (64bit) English UI [OOO340m1 (Build:11)]

Steps to reproduce: 
1. open attached sample.ods
2. Click A21
3. Click Fill handle and drag / drop it until cells ...A25 will be filled. 
   So you should have done the Fill > Series function and new contents of cells 
   should be numbers 21 ... 24 in A21:A25
4. click undo button before nest test
   All new contents should disappear
5. Use Filter: Click Auto Filter arrow in column E with ehading e
6. Filter empty
   Nothing should happen all cells are empty in this column
8. redo from step 2 ... step 4
   Expected: same result numbers 21 ... 24 in A22:A25
   Actual: All new cell contents is 20

I also tested with OOo 3.1.1 there fill handle works as expected also with active filter.

I only see that problem having used Auto Filter. Doing the same filtering with Standard Filter does not show the broken fill series effect.

I believe this is a regression I believe I would have remarked if that would had happened in stable LibO versions.

However since glib-2.31 only glib.h may be included directly and the individual includes throw an error (see [1]). Before that change there was a long deprecation period.

The reason this hasn't blown up in fribidi (at least it builds here) is probably that glib.h is included in common.h masking the error.

"CAIRO-23539","bitmap font is not scaled by cairo_scale()","Created attachment 28944
cairo_bitmap_font_scale.c

This bug was reported as bug 18001 about 1 year ago.
Actually it is not only reproducible with PS backend but also with image and PDF backend perhaps all backend.
It is not only reproducible with freetype fonts either. I can reproduce it with Windows. See (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448186)

However I filed this bug against freetype font backend because I think different font backend may require different fixes.
Please correct me if I were wrong.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Enable bitmap font on Ubuntu or use Solaris.
See: http://www.alanbriolat.co.uk/2009/04/enable-bitmap-fonts-on-ubuntu-jaunty/

2) Run fc-match Courier
Make sure you get a *.pcf or *.pcf.gz file.

3) Compile and run attached cairo_bitmap_font_scale.c.

4) If you change Courier to a non bitmap font the result is correct.

I've proposed a draft fix half a year ago in mozilla bug 448186.
Attached try.patch.

However I don't think it's the right fix.
If we do _transform_glyph_bitmap() there it will make the glyph unreadable if it is scaled down to 50% or 30%.

For PS if we use scale operator inside /Glyphs we can get a better result.

At first I thought I had to RMA the notebook because the display only showed a single horizontal line in the middle of the screen. Rebooting the machine showed various problems: missing icons (like the faces icon for users on the GDM screen) and after logging in various bluish - magentaish rectangles on the screen. Rebooting back to 3.3.7 at the time didn't fix the problem but after yum reinstall * at least 3.3.7-1.fc17 is usable. 3.4.0-1.fc17 reliably shows this problem.

Today I accidentally reproduced this on my desktop machine with AMD Radeon HD6570 and kernel 3.4.0-1.fc17. I use Cinnamon on both machines. It turns out that the bad behaviour only shows up (but reliably) if I move the mouse pointer to the magic spot on the screen i.e. the top-left corner so the workspace switcher kicks in. Killing X with Ctrl-Alt-BkSp cures it. The difference between my desktop machine and the notebook is that for some reason when X starts the cursor shows up in the top-left corner on my notebook but in the middle of the screen on my desktop machine. So the error occurred on the notebook as soon login was attempted without moving the mouse.

Since yesterday the above libX11* and xorg-x11-drv-ati versions were moved to updated from updates-testing.

Today I performed a yum reinstall * to ensure that every packages are ok. memtest86+ was ran on the machine after I bought it in January it happily ran Fedora 16. Then it was upgraded to F17 during its RC series and only yum upgrade was performed since then possibly missing some rebuilds which yum reinstall * finally included. Or it was simply a gremlin in the machine.

After this yum reinstall * I rebooted several times switching between 3.4.0 and 3.3.7. 3.3.7 is usable 3.4.0 triggers the invalid command stream messages in the syslog.",594,"1"

Steps to reproduce:
1. open a presentation
2. choose File -> Export and change the type to html document
3. continue until you get to the dialog where you can change the output resolution
4. there are three options available: 640x480 800x600 1024x768 select 1024x768
5. after finishing the export observe that the output images are in 800x600 resolution.

The following commit:

    drm/nouveau/fence: convert to exec engine and improve channel sync
    
    Now have a somewhat simpler semaphore sync implementation for nv17:nv84
    and a switched to using semaphores as fences on nv84+ and making use of
    the hardware's >= acquire operation.

Probably causes the FX5200 to fail to resume. I'm not 100% completely sure since reverting this commit on top of head is not without conflicts since the revent cleanups and reworks. I cannot proceed without help. If someone could generate a revert of this commit on top of current HEAD I will then be able to confirm this is the exact bad commit.

Rebooted the image and just as the splash screen appeared pressed ctrl+esc which makes Lubuntu output the boot activities. As it when down the list of services it was activating all the text on the screen started disappearing and reappearing.  Pressed ctrl+alt+f4 was brought to a tty terminal. Logged in and typed startx. The Xserver started yet all that appeared was an error message window and a notification. The rest of the screen was black.

The game Alpha Prime (running with Wine 1.3.30) crashes shortly after start with latest git. With 7.11 I get another crash so I'm not sure if this is a regression or not.

The backtrace from Wine is below I also attached a backtrace from gdb but I'm not sure if it's good or not.

Matthias's log viewer code

Since plymouth conceals boot messages from the user during boot up it should provide a way for users to get at the boot messages after login.  In particular if there was a problem during boot up the user should get notified at the login screen.

It currently stores the boot messages in /var/log/boot.log 

One idea is to make it hard link /var/log/boot.log to /var/spool/somewhere/something . Then there would be a small app that is started in the greeter via /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow that would look at the spool directory on startup read any file that's there into memory remove it from the spool directory and display an icon in gdm's notification area. If the icon gets clicked on the program would display a little vte widget with the buffered boot log.

Matthias has already written some code to display the boot log.",14,"0"

Logfile with ring of Death!

Hello

I have following problem to report. I own a Medion Akoya E1210 (Aka: MSI WIND U100) Netbook with an GMA950 graphic chipset inside it.

For this and some other reasons - that doesn't matter for the problem description - I had to compile a recent version of XOrg (the release that is supposed to become 7.4). The idea behind that was to go with a much recent version of XOrg to benefit from recent drivers better support better way to report issues like this one.

XOrg works so far no real problem. Compiz and all the fine 3D effects work as expected. But the real issue that I get is this ...

... The driver crashes every now and then at random times and gives Ring of Death messages in the X.log files (please refer to my attachment) ...

I like to mention that compiling XOrg was a quite trivial task since I use to do things like this back since 1996 - so some sort of experience exists. XOrg is not having issues with older drivers not having issues with Kernel related DRI not having any l33t configure flags (just configure --prefix=/usr/X11R7 ... yeah I am historical) and the GCC vesion used was 4.1.2. There is also no ABI (C++) or API incomatibilities around the Tools that I use that might cause this. Since this is happening all the time regardless what I use... Be it Firefox Evolution VMware I even get these crashes while using TWM with nothing more than just firefox and xterm (tested this one too to avoid reporting false bugreports).

I'd like to get some feedback here and would really like to help solving this issue - or at least some feedback howto workaround it for the time being. I also tested this by disabling DRI and AIGLX I need to mention that I do use a git version of libdrm - which as mentioned in the documentation was supposed to be the right thing 2.3.1 was last and some sort of 2.4 was required.

"TELEPATHY-26712","Telepathy-logger should support storing and retrieving favorite Telepathy contacts","It'd be handy and nicely-centralized to have the Telepathy logger store and manage a set of favorite Telepathy contacts.

I've created a branch of the logger which adds and implements a simple API for this. The upside to doing this in one place is that different Telepathy-based IM clients can use the same set of favorites.

Danielle could you please review this?

You can browse my branch at the given URL (it's up-to-date with the mainline as of this writing).

The only change is the last commit (though it's several hundred lines splitting it didn't seem useful).

There are a few open questions (comments including the keyword XXX). One of the bigger ones (which may or may not still have a comment in my latest version) is whether the favorite contacts functionality should have its own namespace (vs. org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Logger[.DRAFT]).

I also wish I could have avoided the FavouriteContactsIsReady property and FavouriteContactsReady signal altogether. But there doesn't seem to be any other way that doesn't either expose a race condition between the logger deserializing the favorite contacts file or adding some excessive infrastructure (like queues for method calls that arrive between the start and end of that deserialization). Beyond that the first is gramatically awkward (and inappropriate for a property?) and they sound like synonyms to me anyhow.

I'm looking forward to any and all critiques.",3,"0"

I am running X11R6-6.8.1 in a 598MLR motherboard with on-board AGP video

But a few things happens:

1. In first time all got ok only a little flickering in screen.
2. If i Ctrl+Alt+BS and start X again the SiS video works OK but the
   Trident video looses the correct frequency and i lose the image (sometimes
   the screen goes to 800x600 instead 1280x1024).
3. If i Crtl+Alt+BS again and start X again both screens loose their video.
   Ctrl+Alt+BS don't works (ok it works but i don't got console back!).

This things all happens in 16bit mode. In 24bit mode the Trident screen
got very confused and flickering. I try many times only one time i got an
real error message talking about vm86 error on trident module.

"XORG-15608","[965GM] Font corruption when switching back from VT to X","Created attachment 16041
xorg.conf

Fonts are corrupted (look like little blocks) when I switch back to X from a
virtual console. Restarting X is the only solution.

Reproducible: Always with .903 not with .902 or .901

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch to virtual console and make some output occur (e.g. dmesg)
2. Switch back to X with Ctrl-Alt-F7

Actual Results:  
Fonts are corrupted can't read anything.

Expected Results:  
Non-corrupt fonts.

"DRI-33867","[bisected] Graphics corruption related to pageflip ioctl support in 2.6.38-rc*","Created attachment 42887
Commits not present in 2.6.37 applied to local branch

I am troubleshooting some graphics corruption I noticed when testing the post-2.6.37 commits from drm-airlied git (drm-fixes in this case).  I was trying to produce a kernel as close as possible to the latest stable release (since 2.6.38 is very early in the rc stage) with all of the newest radeon-related features.

This is a preliminary report and may turn out to be invalid because the kernel I am using is actually a local branch from v2.6.37 with only the commits from drm-airlied relevant to my hardware individually cherry-picked.  I have bisected the problem down to a specific commit but if I made any errors during the cherry-pick process then this report is useless.  I plan to confirm that the problem is real tomorrow by building directly from the drm-airlied/drm-fixes tree (which was the most up-to-date tree I could find today).

As I will report below there is some similarity with

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33515

and that is the only reason I decided to report my findings before I am really sure there is a problem.  Hopefully this will help Michel and other devs save some time and trouble if my guess (that my bug is related) turns out to be correct.
----------------------

OK here is what I have done so far:

1.  I made a local git branch based on v2.6.37.
2.  I identified commits I wanted from drm-airlied/drm-fixes (Feb. 2 2011)
3.  Because of GPU lockups recently cured by Alex Deucher I picked one particular commit first (1e644d6d drm/radeon/kms: re-emit full context state for evergreen blits) without this testing would be pointless since my GPU would just lock up when trying and 3D app.
4.  I then cherry-picked the rest of the commits I had chosen in order from oldest to newest (according to 'git log').  See attached file 'applied-cherry-picks.txt' if interested in specifics.

Everything actually seemed to be working fine I only happened to notice a small glitch.  I use a locally-built game called 'prboom-plus' with my original Ultimate DOOM WAD file to test Radeon support (in kernels Mesa xf86-video-ati etc.).  When a game begins there is a melt-down animation which transitions into the new game there is a similar (I would have guessed identical before) melting effect when the player is killed but hits the space bar to restart the game.  In this second melting effect after being killed the melted part of the screen was all black a clear regression.

Before today's testing I had been using a straight 2.6.37 kernel with the patch from Alex I mentioned in item 3 above.  With that kernel both melting effects work fine.  That seems to rule out a problem with xorg-server mesa libdrm or xf86-video-ati.

I decided to try bisecting the issue.  I built kernels from the first and last commits listed in the attached file:  1e644d6d and dca0d612.  The former was good and the latter bad.  The bisect jumped to 204663c4 and 18007401 next -- both were bad.  The next jump 65705962 caused 'prboom-plus' to hang during the second kind of melting I was able to SSH into the machine and 'kill -9' the game.

Since there was a series of TTM related changes in that series of commits I used 'git bisect skip' until I was presented with a commit before or after the TTM series I tested the kernels (all hung on the second melt) but told git to skip them the ones I pretended to skip were eba67093 95762c2b and 702adba2.  I was offered 147666fb and it was bad but did not hang during the second kind of melt.

Continuing the bisect took me back to 2357cbe5 which hung X so that it could not be killed with 'kill -9' I had to reboot via SSH.

I skipped ecf7ace9 and 68c4fa31 without building kernels.  The bisect then went to d6ea8886 and b6724405 which hung (so I pretended to skip them).  I skipped 96726fe50 without building.  The bisect moved to 3e4ea742 which hung and 6f34be50 which also hung.

Interestingly f5a80209 was perfectly OK.  This meant that the last commit I tested was the first bad commit.  I had been skipping the commits causing hangs because I expected the hang to be a temporary problem resolved somewhere in the middle of the list I believed this because of the fact the first and last commits in my list did _not_ produce hanging kernels.  Of course I was actually building most of the kernels that I skipped so I knew they were bad even if git did not.

To sum up. the first three cherry-picks (applied to v2.6.37) were fine:

  1e644d6dce366a7bae22484f60133b61ba322911
  drm/radeon/kms: re-emit full context state for evergreen blits

  27641c3f003e7f3b6585c01d8a788883603eb262
  drm/vblank: Add support for precise vblank timestamping.

  f5a8020903932624cf020dc72455a10a3e005087
  drm/kms/radeon: Add support for precise vblank timestamping.

The commit which introduced the hangs -- and these happened entirely predictably and consistently: when the second kind of melt in 'prboom-plus' occurs -- was

  6f34be50bd1bdd2ff3c955940e033a80d05f248a
  drm/radeon/kms: add pageflip ioctl support (v3)

After a series of several TTM-related commits the hanging was resolved and the second kind of melt would display in all black instead beginning at this commit:

  147666fb3b93b8c484f562da33a37f886ddff768
  drm/radeon: Use the ttm execbuf utilities


As I mentioned above these results are preliminary I will try builds directly from drm-airlied tomorrow since we are snowed-in here in Michigan and I don't have to work tomorrow.

My problems with hangs sound very similar to f.d.o. bug #33515.  This may also be related to #33418 since that user (Erdem) is using 2.6.38-rc1.

"LIBREOFFICE-52392",": Bibliography database autofills empty fields with symbols","Created attachment 64538
Screenshoot with the symbols that appear and how it's seen in the bibliographic index.

Problem description: 
When you create a new entry in the Bibliographic database the fields that you don't fill are autofilled with a buggy triangle symbol.

Then if you add a bibliographic entry from the database to the document and you have an index the symbols are shown.

Appears in both 3.5.5.3 and 3.5.5.2.

Steps to reproduce:
1. From Tools -> Bibliographic database create a new bibliographic entry filling only the Identifier and for example the Type.
2. Click on another entry or close the database navigator.

Current behavior:
The newly created one will be filled by symbols where there were no data.

Inserting into the document a reference to this new entry and updating a default Bibliographic Index will make appear these symbols into the index.

It does not happen when adding a new bibliography entry internally to the document and not to the database.

You can try to delete the auto-filled fields in the database but it's difficult you have to do from the leftiest cell to rightest otherwise it gets filled another time.

Expected behavior:
Not to fill up the empty fields with symbols.

During normal Firefox usage the screen either goes black and the console freezes or an image remains and the mouse cursor is movable but nothing else responds. (I can't be very precise about the failure modes because they are being described to me remotely by a computer-phobic user.)

Anyway here is what I see in the X server log file:

Restarting the server (with Alt-SysRq-K) appears to lead to another black screen / movable mouse cursor / dead console hang with the new server log peppered with Failed to submit batch buffer messages.

There's no core dumps for these and grabbing a batchbuffer dump at one point actually horked the system completely (presumably a kernel panic as SSH no longer responded) so I'm not sure what additional information I could provide that would help track this bug down.",63,"0"

"XORG-37174","Missing -novtswitch option","Under FreeBSD (or kFreeBSD for that matter) there is like with Linux some code to switch back to the VT from which the X server was launched. It’s at hw/xfree86/os-support/bsd/bsd_init.c:683:

This code is useful when you start X from a console but it becomes obnoxious when run from a display manager causing unwanted and uncontrolled VT switches when you change users.

Under Linux it can be disabled using the -novtswitch option but it is not implemented with FreeBSD. It would be nice to be able to rely on a sane VT switching behavior on FreeBSD too (and I guess that would fix the other BSDs as well).",2507,"1"

"MESA-4022","static_assert macro in slang_utility.h doesn't work with gcc","Mesa/src/mesa/shader/slang/slang_utility.h contains this bit of hackery to
make assertions at compile time:
#define static_assert(expr) do { int _array[(expr) ? 1 : 0] _array[0] } while
(0)

Unfortunately one of gcc's extensions causes it to think there's nothing wrong
with a zero length array so this doesn't trigger an error in gcc when the
assertion is false.   To do that the array length needs to be changed from 0 
to -1 since gcc agrees that an array of negative length is indeed an error.

However once this bug is fixed slang_execute.c will become unbuildable with
gcc on 64-bit machines due to bug #4021.",2,"0"

After a long time firefox comes back to life and the shader failed to build. The same shader works on other machines and freezing for more than 5 minutes seems way too long in my opinion (even though I agree that building webgl shaders on the main thread is probably not the best practice on firefox's side).

The commit messages should say enough except maybe the third: it not just replaces hexadecimal codes with symbolic names but also extends a bit the second Persian layout.  This second layout adds the keypad but then *excludes* the ASCII digits on the fourth level which seems weird and unintentional to me.  Adding them cannot do any harm I would think so I've added the include.

The fifth patch normalizes the indentation of the lists of languade codes.  Maybe deviant layout was chosen on purpose to be more conspicuous but it hasn't been done consistently so I've normalized it.",153,"0"

"XORG-15903","LANG=en_US xclock -digital -font fixed has wrong size","In a locale other than C running xclock -digital with fixed font and no other X resources results in a window that is too narrow.  Looking at recent changes to xclock's Clock.c there appears to be a subtle logic error for which I have attached a simple patch.

The first attachment shows an xclock started with LANG=en_US.utf-8 xclock -digital with no X resources.

Look at Clock.c from the xclock source code.

Find this block of code around line 680.  The if (!no_locale) statement below used to just be an else in an earlier version and the no_locale = True else statement was not present.  Clearly (looking at a wider section of code than pasted here) the lower block is supposed to be run in the event of a null value for w->clock.fontSet.

	       min_height = fse->max_logical_extent.height +
		 3 * w->clock.padding
	   } else {
	       no_locale = True
	   }
       }

       if (!no_locale)
#endif /* NO_I18N */
       {
	   if (w->clock.font == NULL)
	       w->clock.font = XQueryFont( XtDisplay(w)


The problem is that this used to be an if (...) { ... } else if (...) { ... } else { ... } and has now become an if (...) { ... } else if (...) { ... } if (...) { ... }.  The last if block (the if (!no_locale) block the beginning of which is shown above) should not be run if the first if block (if (w->clock.render)) was true.  This is a simple case of a missing set of braces.  It's pretty obvious studying the code but it's not that easy to see because of all the #ifdefs.

The second attachment is a patch that fixes the problem.  The patch just adds a missing set of braces and reindents the intervening code.  I hope you will consider inclusion of this patch.  I have also reported this in both Red Hat's and Debian's bug tracking systems.

Thanks.

And yes this proves that some people still run xclock!  I like my minimalistic desktop with the xclock in the lower-right hand corner where it's been for a long time.  (I started running X with X10R4.) :-)",1241,"1"

When creating a scatter chart where only symbols are present (i.e. no line conecting them) series color remains deactivated thus it's not possible to change the series color

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a symbol-only scatter chart
2. Select one of the series of the chart and try to format it
3. Try to change at least one of the series color

Current behavior:
Color option is deactivated making formatting impossible. 

Expected behavior:
Color should be electable as before 4.2 
              
Workaround:
Select any different line style from none (continuous dotted etc.) which activates series color option.

"PACKAGEKIT-22708","gpk-updaste-viewer hangs on scanning installed applications","Overview: 
    After applying all updates the tool hangs on scanning installed applications. See screenshot.


Steps to Reproduce:

    I'm not sure what is causing this problem and how to start it. At some time something becomes inconsistent and it hangs.
    I had thoughts that the problem would be related to some extra yum plugins I have in my system but even disabling all plugins the problem persisted.


Actual Results: 
    In Fedora 10 the application hangs clicking on close button makes the window close but gpk-update-viewer remains running in background. I had to kill it manually.
    On Fedora 11 it has the same behavior but quitting the application seems to works around this issue.

    On Fedora 10 I could 'fix' the problem (apparently) setting ScanDesktopFiles=false' in /etc/PackageKit/PackageKit.conf and rebooting the machine.

    drm/i915: refuse to submit more batchbuffers from guilty context

    If context has recently submitted a faulty batchbuffers guilty of
    gpu hang and decides to keep submitting more crap ban it permanently.

    Note: This is just a refinment of the existing policy to declare the
    gpu wedged when it's hanging too often. We have that in place to
    increase the odds of a system surviving gpu hang storms (and so
    getting a useful bug report with the error state).

    With this patch here we reduce the risk to take down unrelated
    applications since especially modern compositors tend to die when
    mesa can't submit batches any more. So for the somewhat common case of
    a specific gl workload causing a gpu hang flurry we should now have
    less grumpy users since we don't take down their entire deskopt
    enviroment any more.

    v2: Store guilty ban status bool in gpu_error instead of pointers
        that might become danling before hang is declared.

    v3: Use return value for banned status instead of stashing state
        into gpu_error (Chris Wilson)

I noticed by reading /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/amdgpu_pm_info that the card fails to go to higher power states.

Here are the screenshots and the way I found to temporarily fix it. I am using Witcher 3 on Steam Proton 3.7.6 as a performance measurement:

https://i.imgur.com/HI6iakk.jpg
1). Initial state. The game is running around 15-20 frames. The pp_od_clk_voltage table seems correct but the power consumption stays around 15 Watts and the clock is stuck at 300 MHz


https://i.imgur.com/LInHonF.jpg
2). Trying to reset it straight away is not helping.


https://i.imgur.com/klkGSoA.jpg
3). Writing a value in to that is already on the table of pp_od_clk_voltage is also not helping.


https://i.imgur.com/BH8ZwIr.jpg
4). Setting a value slightly different than will actually allow the GPU to change its power state to a higher level. However it is still not fully powered as it would be  without overclocking enabled. The frame rate is only 20-30 and the power is around 80 Watts.


https://i.imgur.com/x1Mipja.jpg
5). Resetting the values now will fully enable the card. Frame rate goes to 100 frames per second and power consumption to 100 Watts.

I observed an issue which is often reproducible but not always.

I am able to reproduce this with Ubuntu Kernel 4.7 and 4.8 using a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Tablet with additional Productivity Module and Onelink+ Docking Station. Additionally an external display has to be plugged at the Docking Station (VGA or DP happens more often with VGA)

I configured both displays (internal and external) at F7 X server console. After that I started a second X server at an other console (e.g. F1). I configured X to use both displays. Then I unplugged the external display from the docking station. After that I terminated the X Server on console F1 and switch to X Server at console F7.

After doing these steps I got a black screen and the system freezes.

At a system where debugging is much easier for me I got the following debug output in that case:

The memory protection fault occurred at 0xfefefefefefefefe. This is because grsec will overwrite all freed data with these value. So it looks like a use after free. Not using grsec this is still reproducible but not every time. But if I instrument kfree this way that I write 0x0 to the freed buffer it is always reproducible again. So I assume that in case it is working without a crash at default ubuntu the memory was not reused util the use after free.

After some debugging I found that restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked will restore the fbdev mode and access the fb_helper structure in drm_fb_helper.c. There the drm_connector was removed from fb_helper->connector_info. This is because the unplug was detected and the connected unregistered (drm_connector_unregister) and drm_fb_helper_remove_one_connector was called. Just before the restore the fbdev mode the last reference of the drm_connector was removed and the cleanup of the drm_connected was done (drm_connector_cleanup).

Inside the fb_helper->crtc_info[i].mode_set there is still a reference to this connector (was not removed during unplug). This reference is accessed during fbdev mode restore and the memory protection fault will occur.

My plan is:
1.) Get someone to copy over the git repository from [3] to xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics (this is the thing where I need help with)
2.) Create a branch named synaptics-gpl
3.) Remove the contributions from Matthew Garrett from the master branch (yes we all know the driver will be worse)
4.) Change the license and headers to MIT.
5.) Update the build system to be compatible with the rest of the X.org tree

Early on in the game (GOG ver. 2.6.0) you enter a cave.  A short moment later the GPU will hang and from thereon the hang is fully reproducible simply by restarting the game.  Changing options (resolution details windowed/fullscreen) does not make a difference.

"MESA-26525","Rendering bug due to ARB_texture_non_power_of_two","While trying to address a D3D rendering bug report in Wine I've been working on trying to add card recognition support into Wine for the Mesa ATI (R300/R600) drivers. This was in order to resolve a rendering issue when using the Mesa ATI driver. What we've found is that a code workaround to avoid using ARB_texture_non_power_of_two APIs on R300-R500 cards also seems to fix this rendering issue on Mesa DRI R600 (in particular with an HD4800 series card). This would seem to indicate a bug in the ARP texture_non_power_of_two implementation on R600. The Wine bug report is at 
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21515

Comments #45-47 indicate that the rendering problem is fixed by activating a quirk/workaround that avoids ARB_texture_non_power_of_two. Stefan Dosinger's comment #48 indicates what the quirk workaround does how it should not be required on an R600/R700 series card and how that indicates a probable driver bug.",1015,"1"

The current select widget set-up is sub-optimal because it masks the available languages and OSes pushing them into secondary UI for no good reason. Also a user cannot easily use find in page to get to the language she's looking for. Just make it a big list instead.

"LIBVA-67190","[gst-vaapi] H264 video playback regression between 5fe72d9 and 0.5.5","gstreamer-vaapi has stopped playing back h/w accelerated video on Wayland 1.2. At this point it's not known where the regression has occurred-- I assume it's either gstreamer-vaapi or intel-driver. Analysis/bisect will take some time insights or ideas are always welcome.

SETUP:
  * Build wayland 1.2 libva intel-driver gstreamer's 1.0 branch and gstreamer-vaapi
  * Test video:
    - http://www.sintel.org/download
    - Download the HD 1080 mkv-- for testing I re-muxed the video stream into an MP4 container without transcode and has been working fine for months
  * Kill all Xorg servers or boot to 'runlevel 3' text mode
  * Set LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH if necessary
  * Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary
  * For my setup /wld/install is the wayland stack sandbox and is reflected at build time
    - --prefix=/wld/install
  * Run `vainfo` make sure output is sane

REPRODUCE:
  * Launch weston kms
    - weston-launch -- -i0
    - the arguments will prevent display from sleeping
  * gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=Sintel.2010.1080p.mp4 ! \
      qtdemux ! vaapidecode ! vaapisink

EXPECTED: The video plays back in a window-- this pipeline has worked for months. If using a software decode pipeline it plays back.

ACTUAL: gst-launch exits without ever playing the video or displaying a single frame of the video no errors reported.

STDOUT:
libva info: VA-API version 0.34.0
libva info: va_getDriverName() returns 0
libva info: Trying to open /wld/install/lib/dri/i965_drv_video.so

I put this document together to demonstrate the problem.

Problem description: 

In normal body text you can do Insert > Hyperlink and create a link that links out to a webpage or whatnot. When you have a document open in Writer if you hover over this body text link a tool tip comes up that says to Ctrl-Click to follow the link. If you ctrl-click the link the link opens in your web browser.

In frame text you can also do Insert > Hyperlink and create a link. However it is not functional. It's present - if you double click on the frame it highlights you can right-click it and edit the hyperlink properties... but there is no way to click on the link. Click ctrl+click shift+click all do nothing.

Expected behavior:

I would expect a hyperlink in a text frame to behave the same way hyperlinks behave in body text.

"WAYLAND-81745","wl_data_device lacks destructor protocol causes leaks","wl_data_device interface does not have a destructor defined in the protocol which means that the server cannot know if a client destroys a wl_data_device object. This leaks the server-side resource.

To make things worse wl_data_device.data_offer *event* creates a new wl_data_offer protocol object.

If a client has destroyed a wl_data_device the server will not know about it and will keep sending data_offer events as appropriate. As the client does not track the wl_data_device object anymore those events will be ignored in the client. This means that in the server wl_data_offer objects just keep piling up as the server cannot destroy them on its own.

If possible we should add destructor protocol to wl_data_device interface.",102,"0"

As now the tests has been changed to use as XFB name BLOCK_INOUT.value the variable isn't found and a linking error is raised.

"LIBREOFFICE-65385","Lightproof: UI translation must be kept out of pootle","Created attachment 80318
translated properties file for pt-BR LightProof UI

Sentence checking is implemented thru Lightproof and is closely tied to the language.

Some languages have rules that do not match en_US set of rules. These extra rules are not covered by pootle because there is no entry for them. The present scheme created localized UI based on the en_US UI and thus extra entries appears untranslated.

For example pt-BR version of LightProof implements pleonasms and paronyms detections. These rules are not in the en_US version of Lightproof.

The build system creates the localized *.properties files based on the american properties file.

Local Lightproof developers can supply easily the localized properties file. To simplify the translation process I suggest we remove LightProof UI from pootle and get the translated file directly from LP developers.

See gerrit commit http://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/4146/ for the pt-BR example

At least in the pt-BR case this can be easily fixed.",11,"0"

agent: Handle EWOULDBLOCK when transmitting pseudo-TCP segments

As reported on the mailing list[1] the pseudo-TCP code currently aborts the connection if it receives EWOULDBLOCK when transmitting. This is not great.

Patch attached to fix this. The patch is also not great but definitely better than letting the issue persist.

Also available in git form[2].

Thanks to Radosław Kołodziejczyk for identifying and debugging this.

KMS works great native resolution is recognized uxa works.

If I modify intel_lvds.c to:

colors looks like they should without color gradients.

"DRI-54444","[ilk] GPU hangs and cannot reset","Every now and then (sometimes only a few minutes after boot sometimes several days after boot) my screen suddenly freezes for a few seconds before turning black and (after my session manager crashes) showing the login screen. I've attached all information I think is relevant. According to the logfiles i915 module detects a GPU hang and then unsuccessfully tries to reset the chip before terminating. After logging back in 2D acceleration seams to be fully usable (how can I verify that?) there is just no 3D acceleration anymore. If I'm not mistaken the situation got better with the latest kernel updates. (Could be just my imagination...) I used the options in kernel command-line to make using this driver bearable: i915.i915_enable_rc6=0 i915.i915_enable_fbc=0 i915.semaphores=1

"MESA-5199","Mesa bug fixes from accelerated indirect rendering work","I've been working on getting accelerated indirect rendering working and in the
process I've come across 3 problems in mesa:

  - The DRI drawable destructor need to remove the drawable from the hash table
so it isn't freed again during the drawable garbage collection.  Conversely the
garbage collection shoudn't do this.  In the direct rendering case this never
happens since we don't call the DRI drawable destructor directly it's only
invoked during the garbage collection.

  - _gl_copy_visual_to_context_mode() should set the mode->rgbBits and
mode->indexBits corresponding to the actual mode instead of setting both to
config->bufferSize.

  - I've removed the xf86drm.h include from dri_interface.h since it isn't used
by anything in the file.  dri/common/dri_util.h includes xf86drm.h indirectly
this way but the patch adds and explicit include there.

Considering the version of DRM I have seems to have the line

backtrace of the segfault

Due to the lack of documentation I don't really know what I'm doing but I think the following should work...

Software: Linux 3.7-rc5 libdrm from git mesa from git xorg from git (here with -O0 and -g3) xf86-video-ati from git and xf86-video-intel from git.

Hardware:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI WIMBLEDON XT [Radeon HD 7970M] (rev ff)

This is what xrandr says:

$ xrandr --listproviders
Providers: number : 2
Provider 0: id: 112 cap: 0xb Source Output Sink Output Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 8 associated providers: 0 name:Intel
Provider 1: id: 69 cap: 0xd Source Output Source Offload Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 0 associated providers: 0 name:radeon

I'm trying to set the radeon card to being the one stuff is going to be rendered with:

$ xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 69 112

Then I run

$ DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo

and X segfaults. The backtrace is attached. Please tell me if you need more variable values etc.
I'm not sure how well the HD 7970M is supported yet but glxinfo should run...

With DRI_PRIME=0 it works fine on the intel card.

Again this is the quite new AMD Enduro stuff so maybe it behaves differently than PowerXpress.",710,"1"

config files logs and pictures of configuration

Hi
I am unable to create a working configuration with 4 monitors on 2 GeForce 450 (dual headed). I am able to make it working with 3 monitors - see xorg.conf.tripple. The log file is xorg.0.log.tripple. The configuration works also with Xinerama - see monitor-tripple.jpg.

When I add 4th display into the configuration (the same way as 2nd and 3rd) the X doesn't start - see xorg.conf.quadro. No specific error message in the system or xorg log - see xorg.0.log.quadro.
 

I also tried to configure it with proprietary nvidia drivers - I can start X with 4 separate screens but as soon as I enable Xinerama the desktop is shifted to the most right monitor and I must click on the first monitor to be provided on the last one (even for two monitors) - see monitor-nvidia.jpg (selection is on right monitor a mouse cursor on the left one - so there is an offset of a whole monitor). With 4 monitors the offset is 3 monitors :-( 

So I see it as a bug that I am not able to enhance a working dual configuration into quadro one. Neither with nvidia nor nouveau drivers. 


I have this config:

     xorg-x11-drv-libinput-0.8.0-2.fc23.x86_64
(this is the rawhide version not the fc21) I compiled my own libinput from the git version to give it a try and I let libinput manage my touchscreen (HP EliteBook Revolve 810)

It works great except that when I rotate the screen with xrandr there does not seem to be any way to rotate the input coordinates of the touchscreen.

When using evdev one had to play with the properties
        Evdev Axis Inversion (280):     0 0
        Evdev Axes Swap (282):  0

When using wacom you have the property Wacom Rotation to play with.

But with libinput I only have
Device 'Atmel Atmel maXTouch Digitizer':
        Device Enabled (139):   1
        Coordinate Transformation Matrix (141): 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000
        libinput Calibration Matrix (276):      1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000
        libinput Send Events Modes Available (260):     1 0
        libinput Send Events Mode Enabled (261):        0 0
        Device Node (262):      /dev/input/event8
        Device Product ID (263):        1003 33803

I tried to play with the Coordinate Transformation Matrix but it doesn't seem possible: the correct setting would be the matrix
0 1  0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 where I had hopes the -1 would be interpreted as an axis inversion unfortunately it is not the case.

Did I miss something or is there no way to rotate the input coordinates ?",74,"0"

On my desktop the details were only slightly different: when pin 0 didn't pan out the kernel moved on to pin 1 (i915 gmbus ssc) which led to the same failure mode on the first try.  In contrast 2.6.38 on my desktop reported eight attempts on each of pin 0 and pin 6 after which it moved on with no further messages from the DRM subsystem.  (I haven't tested with older kernel versions on my laptop should I?)

"MESA-110257","Major artifacts in mpeg2 vaapi hw decoding","Created attachment 143787
hardware-decoded screenshot

Hi

on latest Mesa I still get tons of artifacts when decoding MPEG2 on my AMD card via VAAPI to the point where it is not usable for video decoding at all to be honest.
I've attached sample screenshots to show the problem - one software-decoded and one hardware-decoded via libva in mpv.
The sample video is taken from https://www.w6rz.net/1080p25.zip but the artifacts are visible more or less on any MPEG2 video including DVDs.

There is this older bug report: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93760 but I'm not sure it's related because I do not get any assertion failure and it vaguely reads like it has been fixed?

For clarification I see no artifacts with VDPAU.

Tested with Mesa-19.1.0-devel (git-bea540173c) libva 2.5.0-pre1 (git-c98b06d2b8) FFmpeg N-93467-g54655623a8
VAAPI driver string: Mesa Gallium driver 19.1.0-devel for Radeon RX 580 Series (POLARIS10 DRM 3.27.0 4.20.13-arch1-1-ARCH LLVM 7.0.1)

I verified this with mpv gstreamer and Kodi.
mpv seems to have disabled mpeg2 hw decoding by default due to this problem: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/3dd59dbe
In Kodi we cannot go this route because we want to support low-end hardware that might have trouble decoding 1080p in software out-of-the-box.
I want to avoid having to blacklist the radeon vaapi driver for mpeg2 if possible.",51,"0"

setxkbmap is a great tool but one has to guess the name of known

"PM-UTILS-24269","Resuming from pm-hibernate hangs at chvt in sleep.d/99video","I have pm-utils-1.2.5 running on a gentoo desktop with a nvidia geforce 6200. The kernel I use is 2.6.30-r6 patched with tuxonice.

Hibernating and resuming from x-server works just fine except for one thing: When resuming the hibernation file gets read which is shown by fbsplash. As soon as it is fully read the screen switches to black with only a white cursor blinking in the top left edge and stays there (obviously vt 63). Switching manually to x by alt-f7 works just fine.

After debugging this problem I found out that pm-utils hangs at the hook 99video precisely at the call 'chvt $(restorestate console)' in maybe_deallocvt(). pm-suspend.log shows that it is called correctly by 'chvt 7' but this is the last entry in the log during the hang. Only alt-f7 makes it resume.

I found out that inserting 'sleep 3' in 99video just in front of the maybe_deallocvt call helps to avoid the problem. But thats just half a solution since it delays the resume and (worse) gets overwritten by every update of pm-utils. Some idea what is happening here?

be untrusted) give the command xmag (no arguments).  It has an infinite loop 
saying X error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window 
parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  67 (X_PolyRectangle).  (And it 
gives the resource ID failed serno and current serno.)  Most likely it is 
trying to draw its selection cursor.  No blame for running afoul of the security 
system but it should do it once and die not get an infinite loop.
    Please forgive me if I've identified the wrong component to complain about 
but a Google search suggested that xmag does exist as a subdir of xorg and 
there were no other xmag bugs that I could find.",1000,"1"
"LIBREOFFICE-50364","SLIDESHOW: no custom animation for Semitransparent lines","Problem description: 
A line with transparency of 50% or greater cannot be animated with the Wipe effect.  Instead it will simply appear after a delay.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Using one of the Polygon drawing tools draw a line on a slide.
2. Increase the width of the line so that it's easy to see.
3. Use the Format | Line menu to change the transparency of the line to 50%.
4. Under Custom Animation click Add.  On the Entrance tab select the Wipe effect.  For Speed choose Slow.  Click OK.  Make sure that Start has On click that Direction is appropriate for the direction of the line and that Speed is Slow.
5. Click Slide Show or press F5.  Click the mouse.  After a delay the line will appear but it will not wipe.

Current behavior:
Lines with transparency of 50% or greater do not animate they simply appear after a delay that is roughly the same as the time the animation would have taken.  Lines with transparency less than 50% work correctly.  (I have tried Wipe Peek Venetian Blinds Pinwheel and Boomerang and they all behave the same.)

Expected behavior:
A line should animate the same regardless of its transparency.

ODS file for showing N() function bug

This bug existed in Ubuntu's 3.2.1 version of OpenOffice and I filled a bug report for it but it was never solved. Oracle's version of OpenOffice 3.2.1 (from www.openoffice.org OOO320m18 build 9502) does not have this bug.

In 32-bit Ubuntu 10.10 in LibreOffice Calc installed from PPA (OOO330m19 Ubuntu package 1:3.3.0-1maverick1) the N() function doesn't work as expected. The function should return 0 for non-numeric input (from help file: Returns the numeric value of the given parameter. Returns 0 if parameter is text FALSE or #NA.) but sometimes returns #VALUE! sometimes ### depending on which cell I put it on which denies its purpose (and makes a lot of my documents completly unusable).

In test example I provided as attachment (TestN.ods) you could see (I hope) that same formula =N(O4) sometimes gives #VALUE! sometimes ### and it should ALWAYS be 0 for text or empty cells.

I had problems installing RC3 from PPA and I waited for the final version. That's the reason that I'm filling this a bit late.",130,"0"

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52835","HTTP server: sync == none disables source","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2010-09-07 05:39:34 +0000 ----

The current behavior in SyncML server mode with client-initiated sync (HTTP server) is that all sources with sync != none are available to the client which then chooses which one it wants to sync with in which mode.

This makes sense because it allows to hide sources that a specific client is not meant to have access to.

But the http://syncevolution.org/development/http-server-howto needs to be adapted so that it actually enables some sources.

Also the '--source-property sync=?' help text should describe this.

I think this wasn't already included in the instructions because the default template enables sources if it finds the corresponding databases. I probably had all of them available thus I didn't run into this problem as you did.

Changed the instructions.

> Also the '--source-property sync=?' help text should describe this.  

'--source-property sync=?'
   Requests a certain synchronization mode when initiating a sync:
     two-way             = only send/receive changes since last sync
     slow                = exchange all items
     refresh-from-client = discard all remote items and replace with
                           the items on the client
     refresh-from-server = discard all local items and replace with
                           the items on the server
     one-way-from-client = transmit changes from client
     one-way-from-server = transmit changes from server
     disabled (or none)  = synchronization disabled
   When accepting a sync session in a SyncML server (HTTP server) only
   sources with sync != disabled are made available to the client
   which chooses the final sync mode based on its own configuration.
   When accepting a sync session in a SyncML client (local sync with
   the server contacting SyncEvolution on a device) the sync mode
   specified in the client is typically overriden by the server.

    mesa: Add error checking in _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() for MRTs
    
    This patch adds required error checking in _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() when
    blitting to multiple color render targets. It also fixes a case when
    blitting to a framebuffer with renderbuffer/texture attached to
    GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT{i} (where i!=0). Earlier it skips color blitting if
    nothing is found attached to GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0.
    
    V2: Fixed a case when number of draw buffer attachments are zero.
    V3: Do compatible_color_datatypes() and compatible_resolve_formats()
        check for all the draw renderbuffers in fbobject.c. Fix debug code
        at bottom of _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() to handle MRTs. Combine error
        checking code for linear blits with other color blit error checking.

dEQP-GLES3.functional.rasterization.primitives.line_strip_wide
dEQP-GLES3.functional.rasterization.primitives.line_loop_wide

In these cases it looks like one of the edges of a line is outside the viewport (right end of the viewport). The hardware seems to clip using the rightmost edge of the line as reference but this means that the leftmost side is clipped before it should according to dEQP.

Enabling the guardand test in gen7 fixes this but a comment in the code suggests that we should not do this to prevent rendering to the underlying surface outside the viewport region (gen8 hw fixes this apparently) so if the guardband is not disabled for this case in gen8 this may be fixed for gen8+.

The OpenGL spec is not clear as to how clipping should work with wide lines but it suggests that for xmajor lines columns of pixels should be rendered and that is not what is happening here (but that section does not consider clipping to any extent). Some texts seem to suggest that OpenGL expects wide lines to be rendered as multiple width=1 lines. If this is the case then deqp is right and intel rendering is bogus (intel renders a paralelogram) but nothing in the OpenGL spec seems to make this clear. I think clipping with wide lines is not clearly specified.

So this might be a bogus tests or incorrect. We had some discussion on this topic in the mailing list:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2015-February/076072.html

dmesg

Running the most recent code of agd5f/drm-next-4.15-dc leads to dmesg spam about vblank time outs (see attachment) and eventual full machine hangs when a 4k screen is connected to my RX560. The maching does not hang if only a 1080p screen is connected and it was running fine on commit 	d7205d5c0f2b09d900231de9026b97105c37d343.
Bisecting produced d050f8ed14494ea23c6e10b5893010946ef0f78b as the first bad commit although on this commit the machine hangs immediatly after boot so it might be a different issue.",34,"0"

==Bug detailed description==

System gets impossible to use due very slow cursor movements.

bisect took me to the point we change to atomic plane helpers but it can be a miss usage of atomic helpers everywhere else.

fix build with ld --as-needed

[ this is forwarded from http://bugs.debian.org/639320 ]
[ patch created by Julian Taylor  ]

the package uim fails to build when using the linker flag --as-needed
This is caused by the library libuim placed before the static 
libuim-counted-init library which needs its symbols.
ld will then drop libuim as it appears not needed.

attached patch fixes this by adding libuim again behind libuim-counted-init

Test case

Using glVertexAttrib4f (or similar) to set a default vertex attrib value doesn't seem to work on the Mesa GLES 2 driver. Using glVertexAttribPointer to set an array value for the attribute for each vertex however seems to work fine.

The attached test case tries to draw a red rectangle using a simple shader. The color is specified using a vertex attribute. For me the rectangle comes out black instead. If you change the #if 0 to #if 1 it will use glVertexAttribPointer instead and it seems to work.

This is tested on my i965 with Mesa git 118a476. I can't test with any later commit because Mesa just gives an assert for all programs after that (but I guess that's a separate issue).

This causes Clutter to display text in black when the string is long enough to use a VBO instead of going through the journal (such as in text-text).",174,"0"

"XORG-33285","LG L245WP monitor has bad EDID. req quirk","Created attachment 42212
binary edid info for vga. this works fine

Hello- after much reading and trying to fix this problem here is the situation:

LG Monitor model L245WP does not work properly when driven by hdmi. Symptom is a screen shifted left and up and cropped on left and right sides. picture quality is poor too. The monitor works fine when driven by vga.

The symptoms I'm seeing match these discussions seen elsewhere which led to solutions for windows operating systems.
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=1884351
http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/showthread.php?t=62749
http://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/showthread.php?t=310242

To summarize those threads the problem is in the monitor's EDID which describes the monitor incorrectly when interrogated over hdmi. The EDID information on the vga connection appears to be correct. To solve the symptoms windows users overrode the EDID information in the registry with a corrected synthetic EDID. Linux users running (older versions of) nvidia drivers were able to override EDID information as well which fixed the symptom. (The nvidia driver's IgnoreEDID option has been deprecated so I believe this fix is not possible now.)

The incorrect EDID information has to do with the width of the monitor being reported as 432mm instead of 520 as seen in Xorg logs:

(II) intel(0): Supported detailed timing:
(II) intel(0): clock: 154.0 MHz   Image Size:  432 x 324 mm

which contradicts an earlier line in the Xorg log showing 520mm:

(II) intel(0): Max Image Size [cm]: horiz.: 52  vert.: 32

Please let me know what more information you need from me to fix this. Additionally it would be nice to be able to work around this bug when using xrandr for dynamic adjustment of video settings - is this the right place for that request?

Thanks
Dan

I have attached the binaray EDID information for both vga and hdmi interfaces to this message.",430,"1"

When creating queries with more than one table and linking them using an outer join (by clicking on the line in the graphical query editor and setting the join type to outer join) the query does not work.  It reates a syntax error because LO inersts a OJ token in the query which PostgreSQL can not handle.

I found no possibility to turn of the OJ token inserting.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a query with two tables that use an outer join
2. Execute the query
3. Look at the resulting error

Current behavior:

Syntax error

Expected behavior:

A working query and a result set.

I think the directx8 sdk is not publically available any more but I can try to write stand alone test apps to show these bugs if needed.

This was worked around in nouveau/linux-2.6 in the commit drm/nouveau: bail out if validation fails repeatedly which allows the kernel to fail gracefully killing only X instead of the whole system.

When 'xrandr -s 800x600' fails monitor loses signal completely. With the kernel workaround in place X can be restarted and everything is good again. Note that sysRq force-fb does restore the mode but not the virtual console image.

Reproduce Steps
==============
1. connect DP or HDMI cable to monitor
2. run $ intel_audio_dump | grep AUD_CONFIG check the pixel_clock
3. change to other resolutions such as 1920x1080 1280x720 and check the pixel_clock

Expected Result
=============
The pixel_clock changes at different resolution. For example 148.5 MHz at 1920x1080 74.25 MHz at 1280x720 etc.

Actual Result
===========
The pixel_clock is always 25.2 MHz

Green zones with radv

On rpcs3 emulator the game shovel knight[npub31682] renders differently on opengl and vulkan. When there are zones with moving water the radv driver displays only a green zone. OpenGl is fine.
I already reported the bug here

list of exported symbols

Version: 5.2.1

Attached is the list of symbols as exported by libxklavier.so.16.

From those 195 symbols 107 can not be found in the header files i.e. they are private.
Please consider hiding those private symbols.
A simple approach could be to use libtools symbols regex [1] like

-export-symbols-regex '^(xkl_.*|_xkl_debug)'

and then name the private symbols _xkl_*

I've included _xkl_debug as it seems to be exported in the API even if the name suggests otherwise.

"PACKAGEKIT-89900","unclear how to run with --verbose by default","I have set myself a noble goal of making sure that packagekit works well for end users. In order to make finding and debugging packagekit issues easier I want to run packagekitd with --verbose option by default. However I fail to find out how to do that.

When I look into /etc/PackageKit/PackageKit.conf there's no option for increased verbosity.

In the Reporting Bugs and FAQ sections on the web there's no info either:
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/pk-bugs.html

    draw: fix flat shading and screen-space linear interpolation in clipper

    This includes:
    - picking up correctly which attributes are flatshaded and which are
      noperspective

    - copying the flatshaded attributes when needed including the
      non-built-in ones

    - correctly interpolating the noperspective attributes in screen-space
      instead than in a 3d-correct fashion.

"LIBREOFFICE-42520",": No uninstaller registration is made upon freshly installing v3.4.3 final","Problem description: -

No uninstall entry is found anywhere on the system after doing a clean install of LibreOffice v3.4.3. 

Either in the Programs & Features section of the Control Panel in Vista & Windows 7 (64 bit) or the Add/Remove Hardware of the older control panel in Windows XP there are no entries found for LibreOffice. 

There is no dedicated uninstaller application found in any of the directories created by LibreOffice.

Microsoft's Windows Installer Clean Up Utility which usually finds theses things does not list LibreOffice as installed on a Windows XP Vista or Windows 7 (64 bit) system.

There is no safe way for the end user to clear LibreOffice from the system in preparation for upgrade other than by using a system restore or re-imaging the system - which is most impractical especially if one wishes to do this some time after installing LibreOffice and having to roll back in time to a much earlier system state.

Please can an uninstaller be made for future version and can someone advise on the safest way I can test the complete removal of LibreOffice v3.4.3 in preparation for future upgraded of LibreOffice?


Steps to reproduce:
1. .... Install the latest version of LibreOffice on a clean system with no previous version of LibreOffice installed
2. .... Search for the uninstall entry in the Control Panel (Programs & Features or Add/Remove Software)
3. .... Search the LibreOffice directories for an uininstaller or use 3rd party uninstaller tools like Microsoft Install Clean Up Utility or CCleaner or jv16 Power Tools and find no entries for LibreOffice in any of them.

Current behaviour: Impossible to safely and thoroughly remove LibreOffice from a Windows system.

Expected behavior: To have a regular uninstall feature in the control panel to correctly and safely uninstall all aspects of LibreOffice.

"POPPLER-46744","[patch] pdftops git 29feb12 -passfonts regression","Created attachment 57789
patch against poppler cloned from git on 29Feb12

When a PDF references a non-embedded font the git version of pdftops ignores -passfonts and attempts to embed an external font.

This is a regression from 0.18.4 on two counts.

First when pdftops embeds the font it creates a font with the name referenced in the pdf even if it embeds a substitute.  This makes the generated EPS file misleading because pre-flight scans of the EPS won't generate warnings about missing fonts but the file will print incorrectly even if the printer has the correct font.

Second even if pdftops embeds a font with the same name the font might be different for example the Linux system running pdftops might have a low quality free font while the printer might have a high quality commercial font.

In addition I have a workflow with a lot of little files that all use a small number of fonts.  For a sample 2326 byte PDF pdftops 0.18.4 generated a 18080 byte EPS while the new git version generates a 1157015 byte EPS over 60X as large due to the embedded font (which happens to be a substitution anyway).  I have to build PS pages that each contain several hundred of these files and all of the extra copies of the font add up.

It seems like someone tried to replace psSubstFonts with psFontPassthrough in GlobalParams but pdftops.cc sets psSubstFonts while GfxFont.cc tests psFontPassthrough.  I made the smallest change to get -passfonts working which was restoring GlobalParams::getPSSubstFonts() and testing globalParams->getPSSubstFonts() in GfxFont::locateFont().  This restores the behavior of 0.18.4 (and previous versions).

Add @ char before type specifier

While building Mesa with the trunk version of clang using its
integrated assembler it complains about the .type directives in

These .type directives are expanded from the GLOBL_FN macro in the same
file:

#define GLOBL_FN(x) GLOBL x  .type x function

However the actual type specifier following the comma should normally
be preceded by an '@' character.  For reference see the binutils
documentation about the .type directive here:

  http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Type.html

Most of the other .S files in Mesa also use an '@' character so I would
like to propose to do the same here for portability between assemblers.
Since this particular .S file seems to be generated from gl_x86_asm.py
I have also updated that script to match.",1,"0"

"XORG-3449","A short warning on the X11 Editres protocol","As seen on bugtraq from Florian Weimer :

The xterm manual page contains a strongly worded warning about the
allowSendEvents configuration option:

| allowSendEvents (class AllowSendEvents)
|    Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events
|    (generated using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be
|    interpreted or discarded.  The default is ‘‘false’’ meaning they
|    are discarded.  Note that allowing such events creates a very
|    large security hole.  The default is ‘‘false.’’

However xterm is an Xt application and therefore speaks a
long-forgotten protocol called Editres.  As a result any Editres
client (such as editres) can instruct an xterm window to change its
allowSendEvents setting.  After that it's possible to send
synthesized events to the xterm window and hijack the terminal.

Other Xt applications may have similar issues.  If an application is
SUID or SGID and does not drop privileges early in the startup
process a privilege escalation vulnerability might exist (but it's
probably easier to exploit it by providing carefully constructed
resource settings from the beginning).

I'm not sure that the author of the paragraph was right to label this
as a security hole certainly it's just a minor one.  However the
xterm documentation should be updated.  (A previous attempt to resolve
this issue quietly had failed.)",122,"0"

I noticed that in the Dvorak layout I submitted last year (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102055) the degree symbol was on the 4th level on the 0 key while the 3rd level had a substantially less useful deadkey_abovering character.

"MESA-4235","pbinfo xdemo program crashes with PSEUDO_COLOR and GRAY_SCALE visuals","PBINFO demo program creates a PBuffer for each visual to test whether PBuffer is
supported for the given visual.
I was able to track down the problem to the following issue:
In FAKEGLX -> Fake_glXCreateGLXPBufferSGIX the function XM_API ->
XMesaCreatePBuffer(XMesaVisual v 0 ...) is called with 0 as the XMesaColormap
cmap. Then in XM_API -> initialize_visual_and_buffer(... cmap) different setup
functions for the different visuals are called (setup_truecolor
setup_grayscale setup_dithered). In setup_grayscale and setup_dithered there is a:
if (!cmap) return GL_FALSE statement which always returns false because
XMesaCreatePBuffer is always called with a 0 colormap!!

I don't know where to fix that problem. I personally do not see why this if
(!cmap) has to be in the two setup functions maybe it should be a bit further
down when checking for a previous buffer to copy the colors from.

I tried starting both Xfce and DWM. I tried DWM just because it's minimal. Xfce was auto-starting a lot of stuff. DWM wasn't auto-starting anything. DWM didn't work either.

Additional info:
The errors generated are not listed in journalctl because I get the following journalctl error:

"XORG-19398","Black screen when VGA is rotated","I'm testing the beta versions and I'm having trouble with a dual screen setup when the VGA output is rotated. It used to work fine with intel 2.5.3 .

Two screens non rotated works fine:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate normal --output VGA --preferred --right-of LVDS --rotate normal
Rotation of LVDS works fine:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate left
Rotation of VGA is accepted by the server but leads to a black VGA screen or VGA screen with some parts of the LVDS screen:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate normal --output VGA --rotate left
(same problem when both displays are rotated)

I've tried to play with the transform option but it didn't lead to any success (and the option is not documented at all so it's not so easy to use).

I don't know how related it is but in addition xrandr reports an effective size of 1200x1921 instead of the expected 1200x1920.

"LIBREOFFICE-59022","FILEOPEN general error (IOErrorCode_ACCESS_DENIED) when opening OpenDocument file on CIFS filesystem","When opening an .odt file on a CIFS filesystem (share from a Windows computer) an error dialog saying General Error appears and the file is not opened.

From gdb with catch throw I see:

(gdb) up
#6  0x00007f71569b3a02 in ucbhelper::cancelCommandExecution (eError=com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode_ACCESS_DENIED

  } }) at /home/master/src/libreoffice/workdirs/libreoffice-4.0/ucbhelper/source/provider/cancelcommandexecution.cxx:112

and indeed from a shell:

$ cat filename.odt
cat: filename.odt: Permission denied

*but* as soon as I do continue in gdb and click away the error dialog the above cat command succeeds!

So it seems LibreOffice somehow tries to open the file twice and keeps itself from doing it (!) through some kind of lock.

Here's what an strace shows:

8679  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt  
8679   {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  open(/path/to/filename.odt O_RDWR|O_EXCL) = 65
8550  fstat(65 {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  fcntl(65 F_SETLK {type=F_WRLCK whence=SEEK_SET start=0 len=0}) = 0

I notice the open is with O_RDWR|O_EXCL. man 2 open says:

 The behavior of O_EXCL is undefined if O_CREAT is not specified.

So LibreOffice should not do that!!!

Then LibreOffice acquires a fcntl exclusive write-lock on the *whole* file (len=0 has the special meaning: until the end of the file).

Then it does several consecutive pread calls on the file several of which are REDUNDANT:

8550  time(NULL)                        = 1357298553
8550  time(NULL)                        = 1357298553

8550  pread(65 h\0162\345\3K\351\2Y\30\6Sp\331\352\205\202\311\215\343\36@\303K\201\22\6\241TzHM... 4096 28672) = 4096

It calls:
 pread(65 4096 0) THREE TIMES
 pread(65 4096 28672) THREE TIMES
 pread(65 4096 32768) TWO TIMES

a bit later:

8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0

(two consecutive calls the access()...)

later it creates its lockfile:

8550  open(/path/to/.~lock.filename.odt# O_RDONLY|O_EXCL) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
8550  open(/path/to/.~lock.filename.odt# O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL 0666) = 69

a few more times access && lstat on the file... and finally it opens the file a second time:

8550  open(/path/to/filename.odt O_RDONLY) = 68
8550  fstat(68 {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  open(/tmp/luj8dx80.tmp/luj8dxdw.tmp O_WRONLY|O_CREAT 0100600) = 69
8550  pread(68 PK\3\4\24\0\0\10\0\0\224P$B^\3062\f'\0\0\0'\0\0\0\10\0\0\0mi... 32767 0) = 8192
8550  write(69 PK\3\4\24\0\0\10\0\0\224P$B^\3062\f'\0\0\0'\0\0\0\10\0\0\0mi... 8192) = 8192
8550  pread(68 0x7fff93aa7850 24765 8192) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
550  close(68)                         = 0

I'm unsure why the first pread call there succeeds since the fcntl call locks the whole file maybe this is some bug/imperfection in the Linux CIFS FS or the Windows file server lock this fcntl() call maps to. Anyway the second pread call fails as should be the case because of the fcntl lock.

LibreOffice then reads from and writes to the file from the first (R/W) fd (again in redundant ways...):

pread(65 WQ'\212\n\305\3D\250n\351\31\341\22\221\35\252\323\374\236\351\232\223Nt\2752\232\6\352\304\352... 4096 4096) = 4096

System: ubuntu hardy/8.04
- hardy alpha 4 (fresh harddisk installation) && apt-get upgrade
- Chipset: Onboard Intel Corporation 82830 CGC (i830M)

- linux-image-generic Version: 2.6.24.7.7
- standard xorg.conf with: Driver  intel or i810

Only starting into an older linux on the same machine (with dri enabled
playing with glxgears) then WARM BOOT (reboot) into ubuntu works.

Same behaviour on SuSE 11 alpha1 and on Ubuntu gutsy/7.10 (since updates of
Jan/2008).

This code works on nvidia but on intel I just get black pixels in the buffer filled by glReadPixels.

If I instead I read GL_BACK (which according to the spec should have undefined contents) on intel I get the image I would expect in the front buffer.

The spec says:

glXSwapBuffers performs an implicit glFlush before it returns. Subsequent OpenGL commands may be issued immediately after calling glXSwapBuffers but are not executed until the buffer exchange is completed.

It looks like instead glReadPixels is executed before the exchange is completed",41,"0"

patch

Hello

I using poppler version 0.12.4. Recently I investigated a malicious PDF file (this is the reason why I can't supply a sample). One of the problems I encountered was failure to open a PDF by poppler. The PDF file contained a static (old style) xref table. At PDFDoc::setup (poppler/PDFDoc.cc file) function we have:

 xref = new XRef(str)
 ...
 catalog = new Catalog(xref)

At XRef constructor we have two flows:
1). Read static xref table
2). If something failed at 1) run dynamic build of XRef. (more expensive procedure)

If the XRef was build OK by flow #1 (statically read from xref) the code will continue to create the Catalog. At Catalog constructor we have two failure flows:

1). If Catalog dictionary was not fetched properly
2). If Pages dictionary was not fetched properly (this is the reason why my file failed to open)

Both could happen after the XRef was constructed which could be problematic.

For example: xref table was build staticaly. If objects in PDF file are not enumerated properly and Pages dictionary is expected at object 3 (3 0) but object 2 (2 0) is missing (condition obj1.getInt() == num at poppler/XRef.cc XRef::fetch(...) function will fail).

For this reason I added a fallback functionality patch.
According to the patch we only once will try to reconstruct XRef dynamically iff Catalog construction fails and XRef was constructed statically.",30,"0"

"XORG-12597","Matrox G550: text mode not restored.","Hi!

after grumbling a long time about Debian bug no. 324500 (with another nod to Michel and all those who felt like him on my latest contribution.  He was right.) which is essentially #615 (and I'm now also hit by #4015 making my head ache on using a high resolution with 60Hz on the better display...)

Anyway... Opening a new bug here because the problem does not exactly match what went before.  The new problem is: after configuring the basic X server automatically (the Debian way dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg) I get working X on the primary screen with a resolution supported by the smaller screen while the smaller screen is blank.  (Not necessarily #4015 might just be clone mode and the initialisation of the 2nd screen missing.  See last bit of #615 which probably is not in the Debian packages I guess.)  Exiting X or trying to switch to a text console with Ctrl+Alt+Fn works fine in software but doesn't restore the screen to text mode (fluffy bit at the top of the screen looks like some funny bit patterns are written to the framebuffer).  I can however work normally (if blindly) even switching back to X works (screen comes back).

My set up hardware:
 * Matrox G550 with one DVI and one VGA output.
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics Inc. MGA G550 AGP (rev 01) (prog-if 00 [VGA])

 * One Hitachi 19 CM772 display (yes that's one of those taking acres of floor space :-) running off the analog output and running as the primary screen (i.e. output active after boot.)

 * One Benq FP767 display (cheap flat panel) running off the DVI output with a DVI -> VGA adapter as it does only have analog input.

The set up software:

all unmodified Debian packages (well almost see Debian bug 443004 but this has nothing to do with anything else I guess) on a system I installed for this purpose from a Debian etch CD and immediately (and before even starting to install X) updated to sid.

Debian package versions:

Generated protocol headers include forward declarations for the protocol interfaces type and extern declarations for the interfaces implementation. The new code also adds those declarations for interfaces that are defined by another extension. This can lead to redundant declarations.

For example if we have an extension protocol with the following interface:


  
    
  


The foo-client-protocol.h file will declare:

struct wl_surface
extern const struct wl_interface wl_surface_interface

which are already declared in wayland-client-protocol.h. So the compiler will output a warning if both headers are included.

Here are solutions thought of on IRC:

 1/ only add the extern declarations in the protocol header for interfaces declared in the xml file not for interfaces that are from a different extension. This is the old behaviour and only breaks client code that uses requests which create an object from a different extension. This is bad design and can be easily fixed by including the other extension protocol header first.

 2/ guard each extern declaration with an #ifndef. This will not work when mixing with old headers which do not have the guards.",5,"0"

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52653","libsoup overrides http_proxy with invalid string: breaks SyncEvolution","


---- Reported by dwmw2@linux.intel.com 2010-11-13 10:25:12 +0000 ----

Syncevolution doesn't use libproxy to find current proxy information as provided by ConnMan it seems to be looking at the static settings in gconf.

And even when those are *correct* it's broken -- it seems to connect to port *zero* of the host which GConf tells it is serving the proxy PAC script.



---- Additional Comments From dwmw2@linux.intel.com 2010-11-13 14:08:53 +0000 ----

Hm it is using the proxy resolver from libsoup-gnome which would have worked. But then it's *overriding* the proxy with the string 'pac+http://autoproxy.intel.com/'.

Soup doesn't recognise 'pac+http' as a URL scheme and that's probably what leads to the attempt to contact port 0.

I can't quite work out where it's pulling that bogus override string from.

This is also happening in MeeGo 1.1.

Is it perhaps somewhere in your SyncEvolution config (proxyHost) or environment (http_proxy). Those override the automatism in libsoup if set (which normally they shouldn't be in MeeGo).

I cannot think of any other reason why SyncEvolution should set the proxy information.

I tried to reproduce it but half-way through the install process realized that it would probably only occur when inside Intel. At home I cannot even set up the Intel specific part of that image - at least not easily. I know about the tricks with routing traffic through a connected machine but that's too involved for now. I'll be in the Ulm site tomorrow and will try again there.



---- Additional Comments From dwmw2@infradead.org 2010-11-22 03:08:14 +0000 ----

You don't have to route through a connected machine. Just use 'openconnect --cookieonly' to get a VPN cookie on another machine then use connman's connect-vpn script to *connect* using that cookie from your test box.

Note that you have to transfer ~/.cert/intel-certchain.crt from your existing machine to the MeeGo box so that openconnect can validate the server's SSL certificate. Then:

/usr/lib/connman/test/connect-vpn openconnect my VPN $SERVERIP intel.com $COOKIE /where/you/put/intel-certchain.crt

You can ssh into the machine as root using the password 'meego' while it's sitting at the firstboot screen. There's no way to make it tell you its IP addresses from the UI so watch for it doing mDNS or note its IP address before you reinstall it (for IPv6 at least it should have a constant address for Legacy IP there are a lot of buggy DHCP servers out there which will move it around).

I found that getenv(http_proxy) returns the pac+http://autoproxy.intel.com string. But is indeed not in the environment. That leaves a setenv() call at runtime and indeed here it is:

Breakpoint 1 __setenv (name=0x4285a353 http_proxy value=0x82d56a8 pac+http://autoproxy.intel.com/

SyncEvolution then picks up that value and passes it to libsoup again.

Note that I wasn't even connected to the Intel intranet while doing the run above. Therefore the sync failed with:

[INFO] SoupTransport Failure: https://m.google.com/syncml via libsoup: Cannot resolve proxy hostname

I don't know why libsoup does that. /system/proxy/autoconfig_url is set to http://autoproxy.intel.com but /system/http_proxy/use_http_proxy is off.

Any suggestions how this should be fixed? Move the http_proxy check in SyncEvolution to a point before libsoup has a chance to mess with the environment? That feels like working around the issue instead of fixing it because other apps invoked indirectly will still inherit the wrong environment.

Somehow I get the same cannot connect to proxy host even while VPN is up. There's no telnet installed (or available?!) but Chrome has no problem accessing http:://autoproxy.intel.com. Is it the pac+http scheme which is causing that problem?

I'm confused. libsoup-gnome should only be doing this crappy setenv thing if it's using a *really* old version of libproxy:


        AC_MSG_CHECKING(libproxy version)
        libproxy_version=`$PKG_CONFIG --modversion libproxy-1.0`
        case $libproxy_version in
        0.2.*)
                AC_MSG_RESULT([$libproxy_version using workarounds...])
                AC_DEFINE(HAVE_LIBPROXY_WITH_NON_THREAD_SAFE_GNOME_MODULE 1 [Defined if libproxy is old and has a non-thread-safe gnome module])




	/* If we have a bad libproxy set environment variables
	 * and force it to use them.
	 */
#ifdef HAVE_LIBPROXY_WITH_NON_THREAD_SAFE_GNOME_MODULE
	g_setenv (PX_CONFIG_ORDER envvar TRUE)
	if (http_proxy)
		g_setenv (http_proxy http_proxy TRUE)


We have never had libproxy 0.2 in MeeGo although now we're using PacRunner it may advertise itself as 0.1.

That answers my previous question about cannot connect to proxy host. It seems that pac+http leads to let's try port 0. Setting port 80 in the autoconfig_url gets me beyond that but then it fails with:

[INFO] SoupTransport Failure: https://m.google.com/syncml via libsoup: Connection terminated unexpectedly

I have not done any network dumps to investigate that further.

Fixed in libsoup commit 25bfd5cbcfb93b94efc7c0f6f0d4bbfa51244e42

Although ideally we should just drop libproxy completely and talk D-Bus directly to pacrunner.

Submitted to Trunk too but it was pointlessly rejected. Apparently we need a *separate* bug filed against Trunk and the changelog there must reference *that* bug so the Trunk and 1.1 packages would be gratuitously different despite having exactly the same code.

lspci -vvnn output

Gets distorted display with a Dell U2711 using the KMS enabled xorg server that comes with Ubuntu Lucid (10.04).

The distortion is such that fonts are rendered almost unreadable (beside that the outline is distorted they have a heavy red tint to them). It seems like that everything gets overlayed with a kind of sawtooth like pattern which distort everyhing including fonts borders on windows and edges in images and such.

The distortion is not present in screenshots.

The distortion seems to be there all the way from boot and up. That is the ubuntu logo with progress bar displayed during boot also displays the same distortion.

When using a different monitor that is a Dell 2005FPW monitor the distortion is all gone. (The U2711 uses dual channel DVI - 2560x1440 resolution while the 2005FPW monitor uses single channel - 1680x1050 resoultion.)

The ATI fglrx driver (ver. 2:8.721-0ubuntu7) works fine with the U2711 monitor (but calculates the DPI wrong - gets 96 while it should be 109 for this monitor).

The videocard is a Radeon HD 4550 card (RV710 chip).

Have tested with the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver that comes with Ubuntu Lucid the driver from ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa (ver. 1:6.12.192+git20100401.6baa96c4-0ubuntu0sarvatt) and with bleeding edge (buildt according to instructions given at http://www.x.org/wiki/radeonBuildHowTo).

From the general discussion around such issues and the KernelModeSettings found on the net I have gotten the understanding that parts of the Xorg driver code now resides in the kernel and it could therefore be that the problem resides there and not in the xserver-xorg-video-ati/radeon driver. Have used the standard kernel (currently 2.6.32-19) that comes with Ubuntu Lucid all the way as I have not found out how to update the KMS parts in the kernel with newer versions (pointers are most welcome). Tried with a 2.6.33 kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.33/ but this kernel gave no change (is from february and the KMS part might therefore not be up to date).",204,"0"

 (drm:i915_error_work_func] resetting chip

The chip then resets which will freeze the client application for about 6 seconds. The application may work but startup will be slow. This only happens once not depending on any time nor boot sequence.

This typically happens when running Weston with the DRM backend and GL renderer (weston --backend=drm-backend.so). Attached a sample program which mimics Weston startup and always reproduces the crash.

Note : issuing non-EGL commands on the GBM surface such as software Pixman/Cairo will not reproduce the crash.

Steps to reproduce :
 1. Disable any other display system (X.Org Weston...)
 2. Reboot with the following kernel options : drm.debug=0x06 log_buf_len=10M initcall_debug ignore_loglevel debug.
 3. Compile and as root run the sample program.
 4. Run dmesg |grep -i drm and notice the crash.",135,"0"
"XORG-59937","Null pointer dereference in ProcXTestFakeInput","Parfait 1.1 reports:

Error: Null pointer dereference (CWE 476)
   Read from null pointer 'dv'
        at line 244 of Xext/xtest.c in function 'ProcXTestFakeInput'.
          Null pointer introduced at line 244.

which corresponds to:

    243         if (nev > 1 && !dev->valuator) {
    244             client->errorValue = dv->first_valuator
    245             return BadValue
    246         }

Unfortunately dv is initialized to NULL before this:
    159     deviceValuator *dv = NULL

and not set to an actual value until afterwards:
    250         for (n = 1 n < nev n++) {
    251             dv = (deviceValuator *) (ev + n)

Should the reference at 244 be to the firstValuator variable set just
before that error check or to another value?

If firstValuator works then this would fix it and prevent further invalid
uses:

the scenario:

Hello

I am testing the new dpm code on my RV730 card:

The screen constantly flickers everytime I interact with the computer like moving the mouse og touching the keyboard. If I don't interact the computer the flickering is alot less. If I boot without radeon.dpm=1 the flicker dissapears.

The flickering is best descripted as if the screen is jumping up and down very fast.

- RV730_smc.bin
- RV730_pfp.bin

"XORG-18259","Xorg 7.4 with xfs breaks GTK+ 1.2 applications such as Xdialog","We have discovered that Xorg 7.4 does not work correctly when using xfs. For example the GTK+ 1.2 function gdk_string_extent() returns a zero width with a font that normally works. This problem is visible with the Xdialog application which crashes with Floating point exception on startup. Here's how to reproduce this on Fedora 9:

* Install xorg-x11-xfs and start it. 
* Install xdialog. 
* In the X session run Xdialog-gtk1 and verify that you can see the help screen. 
* Change the fontpath to use xfs: xset fp= unix/:7100
* Run Xdialog-gtk1 which now crashes with Floating point exception. 

All updates installed. We have also been able to verify this problem with our own Xvnc compiled with the Xorg 7.4 sources against xfs running on Fedora Core 6. The problem has also been verified on the latest Fedora Rawhide. 

I've also been able to verify the problem with the GTK+ calendar demo application located in /usr/share/doc/gtk+-devel-1.2.10/examples/calendar on F9.",224,"0"

Patch that fixes the issue

The i945 cubemap layout code is buggy for the lower mip levels it puts the 4x4 and 2x2 mipmaps on top of each other due to a missing break and the 2x2 mipmap levels are in the wrong order (+X -X +Y -Y +Z -Z instead of +X +Y +Z -X -Y -Z). The attached patch fixes both issues. It also fixes an inconsistency in the comment -- both the code the figure and the rest of the comment assumes 8x8 alignment not 4x4 as the comment says.

I've attached a small conformance test that makes a 64x64 cubemap and draws all faces and mip levels (with reference colors on the left textured rendering on the right). reference-cubemap.png is how it's rendered on all ATI and nVidia cards I've been able to find. i945-cubemap-pre-fix.png is how it looks in Mesa 7.4.1 i945-cubemap-post-fix.png is how it looks after the attached patch.

a) What is this pipe control for?  I don't see the need for it in the docs.

From what I can see the docs for 3DSTATE_WM_HZ_OP say: As this command generates an implicit rectangle SW must make sure any MMIO register writes following WM_HZ_OP must be preceded by PIPE_CONTROL with Command Streamer Stall Enable bit set.

In the code there's a following PIPECONTROL with depth_stall and depth flush bits set which corresponds to the docs in the section 'Depth Buffer Clear'.

"DBUS-48816","dbus-send --address=ADDRESS only works for non-buses","Created attachment 60162
Proposed fix

This is caused by dbus_bus_register() not following dbus_connection_open().
Without --address= option dbus-send uses session or system bus which doesn't require the extra dbus_bus_register() call.

Reproducible in current git (8734e4a16ff220a7af0fd718ba50f92d23c496cf).

Steps to reproduce:
1) console1 # dbus-launch
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=
...
2) console1 # dbus-monitor --address  type=signal
3) console2 # dbus-send --address= --type=signal /qqq foo.bar.baz

Actual result:
dbus-monitor on console1 doesn't receive the signal

Expected result:
dbus-monitor on console1 does receive the signal

screenshot showing expanded rows with data and lower rows that have not been redrawn

Pasting in financial data coppied from smile.com causes the lines not to match up on screen

Steps to reproduce:
1. (assuming you have a smile.com bank account with some data)
2. Open a statement in smile.com
3. Highlight several rows of data and CTRL-C to copy
4. Open LibreOffice Calc
5. Click on A1
6. Press CTRL-V to paste

Current behavior:
The rows pasted in are a different height than the current rows so they take up more room however the rows that haven't been pasted into don't move down. They are only redrawn on a page down/page up.

Expected behavior:
The rows below those that have expanded should move down.

"SYSTEMD-64217","Logind occupies 100% CPU after resume","With systemd 198 (probably 199) 200 and 202  systemd occupies 100% CPU when suspending (to RAM or to disk) from KDE – and only when NetworkManager is used. Restarting systemd-logind solves this though one needs to manually restart NetworkManager too.
stracing logind shows
epoll_wait(4 {} 1 0)                 = 0
being called multiple times per second. When I attached gdb to systemd-logind to locate the issue it showied that logind is cycling around in login/logind.c (manager_run). The line numbers are from logind as of 202. The output is available at http://paste.chakra-project.org/4560/
So far I've seen this only affecting us (Chakra Linux) though I don't know how many distributions besides Arch and us and us have packaged systemd > 197 so far. As stated above this could only be reproduced on systems suspending from KDE and using NetworkManager. Users running wicd or using systemctl suspend were not affected.

"XORG-53","man page of Xft confuses 0 and NULL","The man page of Xft contains: 
 
man Xft>        XftFont * 
man Xft>        XftFontOpen (Display *dpy int screen ...) 
man Xft>        XftFontOpen takes a list of pattern elements of  the  form

man Xft>        font. 
 
i.e. the man page suggests to use 0. But on 64 bit platforms 0 and 
NULL are not the same therefore this causes problems and often 
crashes. I noticed this because mlterm used 0 instead of NULL in this 
function like written in the man page which made mlterm crash often 
on x86_64. To fix these crashes I only had to replace 0 -> NULL. 
 
The example in the man page

"LIBREOFFICE-63141","Spanish translation replaces Heading (Encabezado) with Header (Encabezamiento)","Created attachment 77459
ODT example created with LibO 3.5.7

Since LibO 3.6 all headings of my files saved with prior LibO version looked smaller. It still happens with LibO 4.0

I could not realize what was happening until today that I downloaded LibO 4.0.2 and didn't use the translated UI.
I will try to describe the problem carefully attaching a ODT file and 3 screenshots.

System: Kubuntu 12.04 with LibO 3.5.7 installed from repositories

Description:
The first screenshot shows a file created with LibO 3.5.7 installed from Kubuntu repos. All formating is done through styles.
So the header has a the Header style (translated as Encabezamiento en LibO 3.5 and prior) headings has their conrresponding Heading styles (Encabezados) and so for bodytext. 

The styles used in this file are:
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 14 pts
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 16.1 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: 9 pts

The second screenshot shows this file opened with LibO 4 without the spanish translation. It shows a correct formating of the file with exactly the same styles as defined in files saved with LibO 3.5.

The third screenshot shows the same file opened with LibO 4 but having already installed the translated UI.
Now the styles has become
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 9 pts (as was Header)
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 10.3 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: doesn't exist


So the problem is that the spanish translation is using Header in place of Heading. When saving this file with LibO 4 with spanish UI opening with Lib 3.5 looks also wrong with the modified styles.",178,"0"

"SHARED-MIME-INFO-20070","The entry for IFF/ILBM is incomplete and somewhat confused","Created attachment 22836
...and the patch

ILBM is one subtype of IFF (Interchange File Format) that contains images (like AIFF is an IFF file containing audio). Or actually it is two image formats (and this is a bit confusing): The first format has the IFF-type ILBM (InterLeaved Bitmap) is mostly used on Amiga computers and usually has the extension iff (or sometimes ilbm). The second format has the IFF-type PBM (not to be confused with Portable BitMap images) is used on PC and usually has the extension lbm (because earlier versiones of FAT didn't let it be ilbm).

But I can't imagine that anybody cares that this is two different formats so they should probably be merged into one called simply ILBM image (even though this is incorrect since the ones commonly used on PC are not actually interleaved). This means ditching the type IFF image (which actually are the interleaved ones) and merging it with ILBM image.

Perhaps there should be an IFF super type for completeness. IFF files are somewhat like binary XML-files that contains a tree of chunks. They where at least until reasently used by Electronic Arts (the original inventor of the format) in games but not for audio or images but rather for game-specific data (like animation mappings for The Sims).",1463,"1"

"XORG-987","XV viewport effect with multiple heads with different resolutions","Hi 
 
Apologies if this is in the wrong category I couldn't find anything xv specific so I picked on the driver 
instead. 
 
I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 with on board ATI Mobility 7500 graphics.  Works great with the radeon 
driver using DRM but xv overlays won't expand to full screen when outputting to my external 
monitor at 1280x1024. 
 
It's very difficult to describe...the video -appears- to be stretching to the full screen but I get a kind of 
viewport effect where I get a box (I am guessing its 1024x768 in size roughly) and if I move the 
box around I can move the viewport and see parts of the movie that are hidden. 
 
If the movie isn't full screen and I have say xine at the top of the screen and I move the mouse to 
the bottom of the screen some of the video that's playing is hidden. 
 
If you can tell me how to do screenshots of overlayed stuff I'll show you what I mean...I hope I've 
described it properly.

If I am holding down the button with my thumb to initiate a drag and I move my finger across the clickpad a scroll event is generated because of the two touch points.

Similarly if I am preparing for a click and have my thumb resting on the clickpad it should not be seen as a second touch.

This can be an option for Clickpads enabled like:

FORMATTING VIEWING Pagebreak not honoured after section endnotes (Example document)

Following a section with endnotes collected at the end of that section the pagebreak in a subsequent paragraph-style (ie. a paragraph following that section) is not honoured if the end-notes project into the page on which that paragraph starts.

Inserting an extra empty paragraph would not really be a fix since it will corrupt the document-flow when the pagesize is altered to suit a different output (ie. e-book iPad optimalized or A4 paper to print).

An example document is attached.

The deletion of words from a user-defined dictionary does not work properly using the UI given at Tools > Options > Language Settings > Writinge Aids.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1) Go to Writing Aids
2) Create a new Dictionary (e.g. with the name test all languages)
3) Edit test
4) Add the words zappy and xappy
5) Hit Close hit OK. test.dic now looks this way:

6) Reopen Writing Aids
7) Remove xappy
8) Hit Close hit OK. test.dic now looks this way:

ANOTHER EXAMPLE
This bug also applies to already existing user dictionaries. Deleting a randaom word from the attached dictionary ends at some confusion around the last few lines. Before:

Simple document where you can reproduce the problem

LibreOffice 3.3.1 on Windows XP 32 bits:

On Writer create a document and include a table on the first paragraph and some text below it (or use the file attached). Type Ctrl+A (or on the menu: Edit > Select All) and it will only select the table (first the cell and then the table) and not all the content of the document (table + text).

If you include a paragraph above the table Select All works fine.",856,"1"
"POPPLER-55977","handling of rtl text inversion is too naive","Created attachment 68555
the patch itself made on poppler 0.20.3. please give it a try.

textpage::dumpfragment makes an attempt to reorder text in it's original directionality. i mean reorder visual to logical order.

however this is generally a very heavy issue to implement handled (to my knowledge of foss) only in icu. 
fribidi does only reorder logical text to visual which may also help here but it's not the real thing.

here is a patch to implement the icu algorithm with a fribidi fallback in poppler.

i did it since the current attempt is not quite correct. a test file to test with pdftotext will be attached too.

please feel free to comment an enjoy.

[Problem]
X crash in EvdevMBEmuBlockHandler() seen in Jaunty and Karmic (with -evdev 2.2.2).  Occurs rarely with no obvious/known steps to reproduce.

[Original Report]

I wasn't doing anything new the time this program crashed. The screen went blank for a few seconds with some vertical colored strands crossing here and there Then a command-line display came up with a few error messages. The system then went to the login window. From there everything worked fine. I have a feeling that this happened because I'm putting too much pressure on my machine. At the time I was having wuala transmission firefox xchat working. And by the way this is not the first time this crash happened but I didn't get the crash report in previous crashed because I've rebooted the system right after it happened.

    drm/i915: Reset GMBUS controller after NAK
    
    Once a NAK has been asserted by the slave we need to reset the GMBUS
    controller in order to continue. This is done by asserting the Software
    Clear Interrupt bit and then clearing it again to restore operations.
    
    If we don't clear the NAK then all future GMBUS xfers will fail
    including DDC probes and EDID retrieval.

The array formula =OFFSET(A1001COUNTA(A1:H1)) returns Error 504 with LibO Beta2.

DRM/AMDGPU logs (journalctl)

I have a Radeon RX Vega 56 connected to a Sony 4K TV (kd-49x8305c) via a Premium (certified) HDMI 2.0 cable. The TV's HDMI input is set to Enhanced Format. Thus on the hardware side everything's ready to go for 4k@60Hz. On the software side I'm running Arch Linux with mesa-git (rev. 066d1dc951) llvm-svn (rev. 313470) and Linux branch amd-staging-drm-next (4.13 rev. dcae401d1113).  I'm running Gnome and I've tested both Wayland and Xorg.

While other functionality such as rendering and acceleration work with this setup I have been unable to access any 4k resolutions.

As you'll see in the attached logs the maximum resolution detected from the TV's EDID is 1920x1080. However using the program edid-decode (output attached) one can see that the EDID clearly advertises 4k modes however they're in the Extension block at VIC indexes higher than 64.

Until recently 64 was the highest supported by drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid.c in the kernel.  However that has been fixed:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8ec6e0755565192b328059b64f982adabbecda78#diff-f1b0089a97dd0195eb24305ab63a79e3

That commit has been merged into the amd-staging-drm-next kernel (but not amd-staging) and the revision that I have built and installed includes that code.  Nevertheless I haven't had any luck in getting the computer to recognize any of those extended modes.

I have tried adding the mode manually via xrandr however when I try to switch to that mode I get the error xrandr: Configure crtc 0 failed. Trying to set it in a conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d also didn't work (I no longer have a configuration file in there). I've also tried forcing it from the kernel command line (video=3840x2160@60) to no avail.  Still all of those seem like workarounds when I think the problem is pretty clearly that the VIC 65+ modes are not detected.",77,"0"

"SYSTEMD-79576","udevd flock() failure on disk partitions due to fsck holding WRITE FLOCK","Created attachment 100341
uded.c:worker_new() flock() attempts debug

Hi

On upgrading from systemd-212 to systemd-213 my development system once again (see BR#75512) no longer is able to reliably mount non-root disk partitions listed in /etc/fstab at boot time. I say 'reliably' here as it is able to do sometimes but mosty not.

On this system I'm using MBR (not GPT) disk partitions and not using lvm.

My grub2 boot kernel line is:
  linux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.14.5 root=/dev/sda7 ro raid=noautodetect quiet

At boot I get the messages like
systemd-fsck[62]: /sbin/fsck.xfs: XFS file system.
[ * ] (1 of 4) A start job is running for dev-sda10.device. (1min 26s / 1min 30s)

The root partition is fine but no other sdaX partitions appear.

In appearence this issue results in the same behavior as described in BR#75512 however note that the kernel has been built with CONFIG_FHANDLE=y here.

I have traced this to systemd-213/src/udev/udevd.c:worker_new() where among other things the following code is new w.r.t sytemd-212

 285                         /*
 286                          * Take a read lock on the device node this establishes

 288                          * access. External processes holding a write lock will

 291                          * udev has finished its event handling.
 292                          */
 293                         if (streq_ptr(block udev_device_get_subsystem(dev))) {
 294                                 struct udev_device *d = dev
 295
 296                                 if (streq_ptr(partition udev_device_get_devtype(d)))
 297                                         d = udev_device_get_parent(d)
 298
 299                                 if (d) {
 300                                         fd_lock = open(udev_device_get_devnode(d) O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK)
 301                                         if (fd_lock >= 0 && flock(fd_lock LOCK_SH|LOCK_NB) < 0) {
 302                                                 log_debug(Unable to flock(%s) skipping event handling: %m udev_device_get_de     vnode(d))
 303                                                 err = -EWOULDBLOCK
 304                                                 goto skip
 305                                         }
 306                                 }
 307                         }
 308

On reaching line 293 in worker_new() for all incoming /dev/sda{X} devices an attempt to flock()  device /dev/sda is made (lines 296-7 => the lock is always attempted on /dev/sda in these cases).

What is happenning is that an fsck process (see attachment) has already placed a WRITE FLOCK on  /dev/sda and so udev processing is skipped. When the problem occurs the result is that no udev processing is done for /dev/sda or any /dev/sdaX partitions.

I've attached a log of events with occur when the flock()'s fail (generated by simply adding some debug code between lines 302 and 303 (I simply print /proc/locks and from that get and print the pid/command(s) which hold FLOCKs). From this log it appears that fsck is holding a WRITE FLOCK before the first entry into worker_new(). Apparently this WRITE FLOCK is held long enough so that
udevd skips all /dev/sda{.X} processing (and I speculate that fsck is then unable to complete its work as well). Looks like a file lock deadlock between fsck and udevd ?

As noted above the problem doesn't always occur it occurs much more frequently on a simple sparsely populated system (9/10 times) than on a full desktop system (1/10 times).

Also if I add 
     systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=kmsg log_buf_len=1M
to the grub boot commandline it rarely occurs and even the addition of debugging code dramatically alters the frequency of occurrence.

In passing also note that it appears that the file close of fd_lock is not done if the 'goto skip' path is taken in the udevd.c code above.

As a temporary work-around I'm now using sytemd-213 without issue with lines 285-308 (plus several other associated lines) removed (thes lines are of course absent in sytemd-212).

I do not know enough about systemd and the kernel to move much further on this so any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks much

"XORG-34051","Graphics artifact in Unity around the tooltips","Forwarding this bug from Ubuntu reporter Jay Taoko:
http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/715405

[Problem]
Rendering corruption is seen in tooltips (see screenshots).  This was reported by a user and reproduced by Jay who is one of the Unity/Compiz developers.

[Original Description]
Some lines appears above the tooltip when running Unity on an ATI gpu with the open source driver. It does not happen with other GPU. The problem is random and shows up on a few of the tooltips only. 
To reproduce move the mouse over the launcher icons (to bring up the tooltips) for a little while. It is best if you have many icons in the launcher. Shortly after some tooltips will exhibit the problem.

After upgrading my kernel from 3.11 to 3.13 I have been experiencing
issues with graphical freezes.  Specific dmesg errors started showing up
after the upgrade (see attached).

When waking the screen from power saving/screensaver the primary
display wakes but X stops responding to input (the mouse cursor can
still move but clicking has no effect). Secondary display does not wake.

This issue persists up to the latest 3.16-rc5.  A commit bisect shows
that fdbc3b1f639bb2cbfb32c612b2699e0ba373317d is the first bad commit.
Reverting that commit on the 3.16-rc5 branch seemed to fix the problem.

Someone trying to help in #systemd was clueless as well even when given the above error message.

I had to use strace and then examine both the  and the systemd source in order to figure out this was due to me not compiling in comprehensive namespace support into my kernel.

Here is a patch that gives a more helpful error message for others that may compile their own kernel or for other reasons end up with a kernel that can't run systemd-nspawn due to lack of CONFIG_*_NS features.

xrandr --verbose (w/o sna external connected and enabled)

I'm working with a Lenovo Thinkpad T520 with a SandyBridge GPU. When xf86-video-intel is compiled with sna enabled I run into problems when switching off the external monitor (via xrandr) that is connected via DVI: Either the laptop screen (LVDS1) turns completely black or is dimmed down so much as to appear being off. Also it seems that internally nothing is changed because the windows and taskbars are not visible. Switching the external monitor back on (via xrandr) brings on the external monitor fine but does not change anything for LVDS1.

The xrandr-calls:

to turn things off:
xrandr --output HDMI3 --off xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto

to turn things on:
xrandr --output HDMI3 --auto --pos 0x0 --primary --output LVDS1 --auto --pos 1600x30

When sna is disabled everything works fine.

"LIBREOFFICE-69271","VIEWING: SVG - class= taking precendence over explicitely defined style= [Regression]","Created attachment 85719
Particular SVG picture showing the regression and screenshots

Problem description: 

As of version 4.1.1 (possibly earlier) SVG picture Background - Gray.svg found in attached zip archive is not displayed correctly when inserted in LO Writer document.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the Front_page.odt document found in attached zip archive.

Current behavior:

In version 4.1.1 of LO Writer the picture is displayed in color instead of light gray. The light gray version of the picture was done by coloring colored version of the picture in light gray using Inkscape. As a result of that light gray color was defined explicitly in style= but the original color was left defined in class=. Here is an example from attached SVG:

<circle
   ...
   style=fill:#e8e8e8fill-opacity:1
   ....
   class=fil24
/>

where class fil24 is defined as:

.fil24 {fill:#2F6864}

In attached zip archive you will find screenshots of the document displayed in LO Writer version 4.0.5 and 4.1.1. It seems that class= is taking precedence over style= so picture is displayed colored instead of light gray.

The SVG picture is displayed correctly (light gray) in version 4.1.1 of LO Draw so only Writer is affected

Expected behavior:

Attached SVG picture should be displayed light gray.

"LIBREOFFICE-45533","EDITING: Pasting TABLE as RTF from SPSS fails","Created attachment 56507
There are Screenshots of how it looks like and the SPSS-Output-File.

Problem description: 

I have problems pasting tables from an SPSS Output Document. SPSS is a software for statisical analysis commonly used in social sciences.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy a Table in SPSS (in my case it was a frequencys-table but that is not important. The Paste fails also with every different table). SPSS makes that an RTF-Export to the clipboard [Ctrl+C]. 

2. Paste it in Libre-Office Writer [Ctrl+V]

Current behavior:

The pasted table looks crappy. It not a pasted table at all. The Pasted contend is a table and some text below it. It is really hard to repair.

If i paste it to M$ Word (where it works fine) copy it in Word again and paste it to LibreOffice than i have a lousy formatted table with VERY thick frames. Therefore i assume that there is a general problem with pasting RTF-Tables.

I attached a ZIP-file with screenshots of how it looks like and the SPSS-output-file. As far as i know it is possible to open the Outputfiles in SPSS and copy content out of it without having a valid licence.

If a developer has further questions feel free to send me a private mail. My German is better than my Englisch )

Expected behavior:

Should look like the source. Or at least look like in OpenOffice. Or even better look like in M$ Word. In M$ Word it looks like the source.

Platform (if different from the browser):
Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit LibreOffice with standard install options.
IBM SPSS version 20. The Bug also appears with content wich is copied with older SPSS-Versions.

So the description of BOUND and CONSTRAINED is essentially the same. One of them must be incorrect.

My guess is that CONSTRAINED means that not all values of the type of the property are acceptable. E.g. the property must be strictly positive or between 50 and 200. My guess is also that it means that setting the property can throw com::sun::star::css::beans::PropertyVetoException.

Patch to fix a malformed error message

If you pay attention to the warnings during a build (using Ubuntu's gcc 4.2.3 at least) you can see the following:

dbus-marshal-recursive.c: In function 'writer_recurse_init_and_check':
dbus-marshal-recursive.c:1660: warning: too many arguments for format

Line dbus/dbus-marshal-recursive.c line 1660 has a large _dbus_warn_check_failed() statement which aims to combine two back-to-back string literals to make a format string.  Unfortunately there's a stray comma between the two literals so the second half of the message is treated as a parameter to be substituted into the first.  Fortunately the first parameter in the first literal is a %s so it won't do anything too evil but it certainly won't look right.

The attached patch (made against the 1.2.3 tarball) removes the extra comma causing the problem.  I haven't really tried to come up with a situation where the message would actually be printed but the fix is pretty obvious.",1,"0"

The bug is when I double-clik on this network file and change the content the firs_error.jpg appears two times and the second_error.jpg appears one time.

I think the problem come from this commit:

"XORG-40306","Add driver-independent API to detect dedicated VRAM size","Currently Xorg (because of OpenGL API limitations) doesn't support easy enough way to detect dedicated VRAM size by OpenGL applications. This makes it hard to detect what resources are available for usage without too big performance penalty.

Here're some links where this problem is discussed:
http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=251672
This one states that Windows and MacOSX do have some mechanisms for this while Linux and other OSes using Xorg don't.
http://wiki.jswindle.com/index.php/Wine_Registry#Video_Memory_Size
This one states that WINE has to guess video memory size (and in reality the result is often incorrect).

So the solution is to provide an API to detect dedicated video memory size not having to resort to NV_CTRL_VIDEO_RAM and similar vendor-specific ways. This might go to xrandr or be an extension for GLX.",1818,"1"

Spreadsheet with conditional formatting (alternate colours)

I set up conditional formatting in Calc such that different background colours appear on alternate rows. If new rows are inserted directly below the rows where the conditional formatting is applied the new rows correctly display the alternate background colours. However when the spreadsheet document is saved closed and then reopened the new rows lose the alternate background colours (i.e. the conditional formatting is lost). See the attached file.

It should be noted that this problem was not inherited from OpenOffice. If the attached file is opened in OpenOffice and new rows are inserted in the same way (i.e. directly below the conditional formatting range) the alternate colours applied to the new rows are preserved after document reopening.",119,"0"
"LIBREOFFICE-77057","Installing/uninstalling LibreOffice messes up the KindMap in Windows 8.1","On the Microsoft forums a number of users reported that the Photos app in Windows 8.1 no longer worked. It would show folders of photos but it wouldn't display the actual photos - it would just say that the folders were empty.

This turned out to be related to this registry key: -

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\KindMap

Listed under that key are file extensions. Affected users noted that the keys for all image file extensions had been changed from picture to document which is what caused the bug in the Photos app. Manually changing the value of each affected key back to picture and then rebuilding the search index fixes the issue.

This issue affected 2 of my machines so I posted a list of the software that's installed on both which includes LibreOffice. Another user also reported that he had LibreOffice installed so that started to look like the likely culprit.

So I then uninstalled LibreOffice entirely. On doing so ALL photo file extensions were removed from the KindMap altogether. I then reinstalled the latest version of LibreOffice and all of the photo extensions were added back into the KindMap but they were all set to document which again breaks the Photos app.

It appears that the bug has 2 elements then: -

1. Installing LibreOffice changes the registry keys for image file extensions in the KindMap from picture to document breaking functionality in Windows 8.1 including Microsoft's standard Photos app.

2. Uninstalling LibreOffice remove the registry keys for image file extensions completely from the KindMap which causes the Photos app in Windows 8.1 to fail to display thumbnails (and it may have other unwanted effects).

Display corruption - elongated font or sometimes just vertical lines.

After a few non-fatal display issues (attachment: corruptBeforeCrash.png) the whole screen goes blank except for a single underscore in the upper left-hand corner (presumably it's a cursor in a character display mode).  After 2.5 seconds the mouse pointer appears in the center. A half-second later I can move the mouse. After 4 seconds (total) I sometimes see a flicker of what looks like startup messages (attachment: flashAfterCrash.jpg - this was very hard to capture).  Then the screen blanks and the process repeats with the single solid underscore in the upper-left-hand corner for 2.5 seconds.

I'm not sure if this is an issue with the intel video driver or DRI or what.

This problem only occurs under 64-bit linux. Under 32-bit I was able to see a very little corruption here and there but no crash.  I think this is a display issue more than a 64-bit issue but in 32-bits it doesn't seem to crash.

First notice disply corruption then total blank screen a few seconds later.

Alternately:
Similar with gnome-terminal or gimp.  Type or something that changes the screen inside the application then wiggle lower-left corner of window (resizing it) until it crashes.  Should only take a few seconds.

I have notebook Macbook Pro with linux on board it works perfectly except some small issues. One issue related to keyboard. That is default keys map is not so good.

You can check how Macbook Pro keyboard look like:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1220

As normal usage i prefer to have several keys map. I prefer to switch 'Left Alt' key with 'Left Windows Key' (Super_L) map small enter key (KPEN) with 'Delete' key and either Eject to Print key.

Here the list:
- Super_L to Alt_L
- Alt_L to Super_L
- KP_Enter to Delete
- Eject to Print

First two rules can be done easily by using Layout options in gnome-keyboard-property application.

For two last rules i made my own Layout options. I map enter to delete key with no problems. But when i made rules for Eject key it wont work.

When i press Eject key it appear as Print key in xev application. My gnome keyboard shortcut set to run print screen application. But when i press eject key on my workspace noting happens.

I also tried to map other key to check if it my fault or not. When i map KP_Enter to Print key everything works fine. But when i map Eject to Print noting going to work.

I try to keep all instances of *lymout* off my installations (but sometimes they sneak in). Normally I have vga=791 video=1024x768@60 on my cmdlines but removal at runtime has no effect on display sleep. Leaving 3 off or replacing 3 with 5 on cmdline does not help either.",1,"0"

"XORG-13459","radeonhd driver with non-ATI PCI vendor ID","On my Samsung R24plusF000 laptop ATI Mobility Radeon X2300 has non-ATI PCI vendor ID. As a result X does not start with radeonhd driver. I see No device found in Xorg.log.

Video card presented in the system as:
Vendor ID: 0x0001
Device ID: 0x7188
Subsystem vendor ID: 0x144D
Subsystem device ID: 0xC515

Patch below resolves this problem for me but it is ugly for PCI_VENDOR_ID_ATI replacement.

After recompiling with this patch applyed my display starts in 1280x800 resolution which is native for my panel.

Moving my finger across the center of the pad. No cursor movement.

Thumb detection seems way too aggressive. It's very easy to trigger especially when needing to drag (pressing hard enough to click).

The pad suppresses most input unless I hold my finger perpendicular or carefully use only light touches.

Gpu hang with graphic problem

Using Applications menu inside Activities panel can hang GPU. On rare occasions it can also happen during normal usage. 

During the hang system can either hang solid(it doesn't even respond to magic keys) or only graphic stops working(while kms console is still usable).

In first state display goes into sleep mode and machine just doesn't response.
In /var/log/messages I saw lots of this:

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52892","convert all vCard/iCalendar properties into field list preserve during updates","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-03-30 03:53:58 +0000 ----

The Synthesis engine now has support for storing unknown properties in its field list. It then can regenerate them when exporting again. This allows preserving arbitrary extensions while merging updates.

Use cases:
* CalDAV/CardDAV which explicitly requires this
* unknown local extensions (for example custom QContactDetails)

Need to use this feature. Also need a test which covers it.

Related to this problem is the lack of CtCap information for some SyncML servers for example Google. See https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15029.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-06-21 10:32:59 +0000 ----

Done by adding XPROPS to contacts.

For contacts it is tested as part of EDSGoogle Contacts sync which depends on this for preserving local extensions.

I consider this resolved for the time being. With calendar we don't have a data loss problem (less relevant extensions peers support them).

"WAYLAND-99703","Trackpad accidental two-finger touch stops cursor movement too early","On macOS and Windows when you move the cursor around at high enough speed an accidental second finger touch on the trackpad does not stop the cursor. Instead the second finger is ignored and cursor movement continues. This is very comfortable as it allows one to rest fingers on the trackpad while doing large mouse movements e.g. crossing the screen.

Linux however immediately switches to two-finger touch (i.e. scroll) as soon as you touch the trackpad irrespective of current cursor speed. This results in frequent inconvenient accidental missed targets or random scrolls where the intent was really mouse movement. This is especially annoying for people who switch back and forth between Linux and other platforms.

If the cursor is presently moving at high enough speed it is unlikely that the person wants to immediately convert that movement to fast scrolling in the same direction. It seems much more likely that the second finger is simply touching the trackpad because it's a natural resting position.

Suggestion: Define a speed threshold above which an incoming second touch is ignored. This could be an option if some people really prefer the current behaviour.",216,"0"

"FONTCONFIG-236","Add 75dpi/100dpi XFree fonts to fonts.conf","I recently installed KDE to try it out. When starting KDE applications I saw a
very ugly font used in the user interface which I thought was weird. I went to
the the KDE control center and noticed that the default font was set to
Helvetica but it surely wasn't helvetica being shown.

I found out that fontconfig wasn't even aware of the helvetica font and
apparently just picked the first font in alphabetically order instead in this
case Agate.

So I wondered why couldn't fontconfig find my Helvetica fonts? They are located
in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi (and 75dpi). Opening up
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf I noticed that only these directories are looked in per
default:

        /usr/share/fonts
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 /usr/local/share/fonts
        ~/.fonts

So I added /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi and suddenly my KDE looked excellent!

Should this font path not be added to fonts.conf per default?

Sorry if I'm wrong about this I'm no font expert but at least this should show
an example of a real world problem.",281,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-45031","Visio import: vertically aligned text is shown horizontally","Created attachment 55902
Example in visio

When importing a Visio file that contains objects with a label that is shown vertically the text is imported as a separate text object of which the text is shown as horizontal text in Draw. This text object is placed in such a manner that it is no longer visually connected to the shape it is associated with. Attached a file made in Visio 2003 and some screenshots (in later submits) of the resulting import in Draw 3.5.0RC1.

I don't know enough of the internals of libvisio to know about the reason why it is implemented like this but wouldn't it be more logical to make use of the text property that shapes have instead of creating separate objects for labels?

The purpose mentioned there (being able to stop the sync between chunks) was better addressed with the Bluez 5.15 suspend/resume API.

However downloading in chunks is useful for another purpose: just downloading large address books (5000 contacts 8KB photo data in each contact) from slow devices (Samsung Galaxy S3) can take 45 minutes.

If the driver always turns off the car after a 15 minute commute he'll never get the entire address book cached. Downloading in chunks can help by starting the download at varying offsets.

The downside is that the PBAP spec doesn't support downloading in chunks reliably if contacts get deleted during the download.",95,"0"

[...]
(See http://launchpadlibrarian.net/30388984/ThreadStacktrace.txt for the full trace).

So it seems that one of device->priv->{native_pathdevice_fileobject_pathdev} is NULL. Unfortunately the stack trace isn't precise enough to tell which one in particular. Most duplicates reported that this happens on trying to mount an encrypted drive.

One could just paper over this by checking for NULL keys before trying to remove from the hash table. It's probably a good idea for robustness anyway but it would paper over the fact that something in the internal state keeping is wrong. These properties aren't queried on device removal but on addition so it doesn't sound like a race condition on already lost data on removal.

native_path is already set in devkit_disks_device_new() so it's unlikely to be NULL. However object_path is set in register_disks_device() and device_file and dev in update_info(). So there is one possible path which could lead to this:

        devkit_disks_device_set_device_file (device g_udev_device_get_device_file (device->priv->d))
        if (device->priv->device_file == NULL) {
                g_warning (No device file for %s device->priv->native_path)
                goto out
        }

So perhaps device_add() shouldn't add such invalid ones to the hash tables or devices which don't have all four data fields should be discarded at all?",8,"0"

The mouse still moves but no input is accepted. You cannot switch console or kill the x-server. You can still log in via ssh. If that's not available the only help is a hard reset of the system.

I suspect this is similiar to bug 20560 - but more intel hardware suppers from that than only the i945. It may be even than this two.

There is a bug report in the fedora bugzilla too:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=464866

I first experienced this bug after having moved from Ubuntu 8.10 to fedora10 two month ago. It is still there in Fedora 11 Beta (intel 2.6.0). In the fedora bug report someone from arch-linux mentioned that this bug first appears in intel-2.5 . My oberservations confirm that as ubuntu 8.10 uses intel-2.4 .

I cannot reproduce this bug on Ubuntu 9.04 beta with a i915 chipset.

WORKAROUND:
The only solution I found is to put „NoAccel“ „yes“ in xorg.conf. Using XAA or tiling does not help.

Maybe important: It never happend when playing a 2D-windows game running fullscreen in wine in 1024x768 resolution. I played many hours so it is really unlikely that I just had luck.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
This bug is triggered randomly. It happens during high activity and it happens when just moving the mouse. But I observed that the probability is higher when having action on your desktop. It happened most often for me when working with eclipse.
For triggering this bug I usually use compiz with many effects enabled. I open up and close applications by scripts every two seconds. When I start doing additional work on the desktop the freeze always occured within 15 minutes.
The freeze most often occurs during compiz animations.",91,"0"

"DRI-45801","[SNB DP regression] no signal via DisplayPort since Linux  3.2","Created attachment 56766
Xorg.0.log under Linux v3.2

This regression was first reported as http://bugs.debian.org/658662

Since upgrading to Linux 3.2 an external display connected via DisplayPort to a Sandy Bridge onboard graphics card stopped working and instead turns off reporting “DP no signal”.

With Linux 3.1 the same display connected via the DisplayPort works fine. After powering both the display and the machine the display first turns on when the i915 kernel module is loaded upon boot. It shows the console with boot messages at the maximum display resolution (1920x1080). Then the X server starts and the external display switches to a lower resolution (1024x768) which seems to be the default setting of the X server. After login I manually switch to the maximum resolution (1920x1080) using the command “xrandr --output DP1 --auto”.

With Linux 3.2 after powering both the display and the machine the display remains dark during boot even when the i915 kernel module is loaded. The display first turns on only when the X server is loaded with the default resolution 1024x768. After login I manually switch to 1920x1080 but then the display reports “DP no signal” and turns *off*.

To summarize: The external display connected via DisplayPort works fine with Linux 3.1 while with Linux 3.2 it works with lower (non-native) resolutions and fails with the maximum (native) resolution.

I noticed one peculiarity: It is possible to have a working external display by booting into Linux 3.1 first and then rebooting into Linux 3.2 *without interrupting the power supply of the display*. However as soon as I power-cycle the display while under Linux 3.2 it stops working again.


There is a recent thread by Keith Packard with DisplayPort-related patches:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/25/204

I tested both a kernel with only PATCH 1/2 as well as a kernel with both PATCH 1/2 and 2/2 applied based on the Debian kernel source (linux-2.6_3.2.2-1) and using the Debian test-patches script. Both kernels showed the same faulty behaviour i.e. the external display remains dark at the native resolution.


Grepping for “display port” in the output of dmesg I noticed a difference in clock frequencies between Linux v3.1 and v3.2. If I assume correctly the three events correspond to the initial boot console (1920x1080) the loading
of X (1024x768) and the manual switch to maximum resolution using xrandr (1920x1080).

"LIBREOFFICE-48256","clean out Hide/Show Cursor ...","In the bad old days of calc everything was rendered explicitly to the screen and then the cursor was rendered over the top using XOR rendering. To get this right before we rendered new things we would need to call:

HideCursor()
// do the incremental render
ShowCursor()

These days we should never do that - all rendering should be done in response to an idle handler and should paint from scratch instead of trying to be 'clever' like this (it will increasingly not work & just waste resources on  modern systems).

So - we need to audit the code for these Hide/Show pairs. Clearly some instances of hiding the cursor are prolly still applicable but we should check all of them in sc/ 'git grep -5 HideCursor' - and remove and re-test all instances.

Potentially we want to add some calls to Invalidate() on the cursor region when this causes problems :-)

"LIBREOFFICE-39212","Loss of OpenOffice default behavior for copying formulas EDITING","In earlier versions of LibreOffice you could use the range of an adjacent column to copy a range of formulas using SHIFT and CTRL-down.

Example of earlier correct behavior in LibreOffice 3.3.2: you have a range of values in A1:A1000. You wish to copy a formula (any formula) from B1 to B2:B1000. You copy the formula in B1 using CTRL-C then move the cursor to B2 press SHIFT and (keeping SHIFT depressed) move the cursor to the left using the left arrow then pressing CTRL-down. The range extends automatically to the cell A1000. You move the cursor (still depressing SHIFT) to B1000 using the right arrow key then press CTRL-V to copy the formula. This behavior was highly useful for effortlessly copying formulas in large spreadsheets.

This desirable behavior no longer works in LibreOffice 3.4.1

Instead there is a slavish devotion to the way MS Excel works which requires manually extending the range in B2 using the mouse or repeatedly pressing the down arrow. This is a real pain in large spreadsheets. (Try it).

I tried enabling OpenOffice.org legacy behavior from the Tools/Optins/LibreOffice Calc/Compatibility menu to no avail. The irritating MS Excel-like behavior continued.

!!!THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING TO A LONG-TERM OOo/LibreOffice USER!!! and makes LibreOffice just as useless for serious spreadsheet work as MS Excel. 

This is a MAJOR inconvenience. Please restore the previous functionality for copying using adjacent columns in LibreOffice 3.4.2",1272,"1"

full backtrace in savageWriteRGBASpan_565()

The drawpix demo draws pixels spread around the screen instead of inside the window. Each line drawn (194 pixels) get displayed in a cluster but not as a line. Only every 6th line get displayed starting from the lower right of the screen going left then up (see drawpix-many.png).

The cluster is divided in 4 squares of 8 times 8 pixels where the first and fourth square is not complete. Each square is drawn from left to right then from top to bottom. Square are drawn from left to right within a cluster. (See drawpix-line.png).

I have tracked the drawing in mesa down to where it writes each pixel into the renderbuffer in savageWriteRGBASpan_565() see the full backtrace in write_rgba-backtrace.gdb.

This is with latest git. I think I have seen similar corruption using the antspotlight screensaver since a long time ago and I never tried drawpix before so this can be an old bug. The bug reporter of the downstream Ubuntu bug says drawpix worked fine in Ubuntu 8.04 which had mesa 7.0.3.",177,"0"

RFC patch on top of 34d59508 (drm/nouveau: fix TTM_PL_TT memtype on pre-nv50)

Commit 0a0afd28 (drm/nv50-/disp: move DP link training to core and
train from supervisor) removed a call to 'nouveau_dp_dpms' at the
bottom of nv50_display.c.

Without this call 'xset dpms force {onoff}' does not have any effect
on my DP-attached monitor.

The attached proof-of-concept patch re-adds the call as well as a partial
version of nouveau_dp_dpms which causes 'force off' to work again.

It is not clear to me how to trigger link training in the supervisor
so nouveau_dp_dpms skips that step when handling DRM_MODE_DPMS_ON.
The result is that 'force on' does not cause the monitor to wake up
and the connection is effectively dead.

Could somebody familiar with the driver could comment on the next
steps to undertake to restore the full {onoff} functionality?",153,"0"

I cannot get Xorg to display that resolution. My research has shown that this is
caused because the Intel Vbios does not correctly report resolutions to Xorg.
There is a walkaround for this problem on Linux with the help of a patch that
modifies memory of the video bios tempoarilly allowing it to display any resolution.

I setup Xorg using the Intel 810 driver which should theoretically work because
it is almost the same card and that did not help either. I can completely
comment out all other available resolution in xorg.conf and it will still
display only 1024x768

The patch for linux can be found here

success it does not compile and it does not install.

Please look into this as this is a somewhat serious problem. The most important

CONCLUSION
The bug was introduced and is lurking in the nouveau code of the official release 3.11.
The NVidia GT430 uses the nouveau driver so it is affected as described
by the subject bug.
Note:  There is a fix gpc hardware regression in the nouveau branch:
 a0b7ebfb39bf80078d12bd1a46ec40d0d0dbdeef
including some patches.
Apparently the corresponding mainline commit is
 d2989b534ef6834ebf2425aecc040b894b567c91
but it doesn't seem to affect (positively) the problem commit

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52875","config migration + auto sync: duplicates configs","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-19 09:21:27 +0000 ----

SyncEvolution 1.1.99.6

* create a config with SyncEvolution < 1.1.99 which has auto syncing enabled
* run syncevo-dbus-server 1.1.99.6
* restart after one auto sync

What happens is this:
1. the server sees the config
2. it starts an auto config
3. it migrates the config which keeps the old config around with an .old suffix
4. restart
5. the server sees the .old config
6. repeat at step 2 ad infinitum
=> creates config .old .old.old .old.old.old ...

There are two options:
- ignore old configs for auto-syncing
- disabled auto-syncing in them

I prefer the second option because old configs are only implicitly marked as such via the config name.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-19 13:04:09 +0000 ----

Same problem also occurred for configs which had auto-syncing disabled and no syncURL set (server configs) because the per-transport-kind check was flawed.

commit a8effb21b8ad5d726829911046bf1c23380e2551

    config migration: avoid name conflicts and auto syncing of old configs (BMC #22691)
    
    When (auto-)migrating a config it was possible that a name for the
    peer say foo.old was chosen for the renamed config although there
    was already such a config for example foo.old in ~/.sync4j. Besides
    being confusing for users this also led to a bug in the code where it
    copied from the older config with the foo.old name.
    
    Found when adding unit testing of migrating configs with auto syncing
    because then the content of the migrated config mattered.
    
    The main problem fixed in this commit is the disabling of auto syncing
    in the old config. Done similar to ConsumerRead by reading/writing
    the .ini (resp. .txt) file directly.

    auto syncing: must check whether enabled when looking at unknown URLs (part of BMC #22691)
    
    syncURL = insert your URL here with autoSync = 0 did lead to auto
    sync attempts although it wasn't enabled. A check for auto syncing
    enabled was missing for the unknown transport case.

transparent toolbars libreoffice on ubuntu

I have installed libreoffice 3.3.0 on ubuntu 10.10 via ppa and the interface is appalling to look at and difficult to use. Big areas of transparency text is missing or hard to read buttons and flat. also moving the window or scrolling often leaves 'anomalies' on the screen. 

I have attached screenshots. I originally installed libreoffice from the website directly and it did not have  these problems but when using the presenters console the console would appear on the external monitor and the main presentation would be on the laptop monitor. I searched and found someone recommend that you install from the ppa source for ubuntu. I uninstalled libreoffice and added the ppa source than installed from that. 

the presentation console now appears on the correct screen but the interface is terrible as can be seen from the attached images.

Have I missed installing something?

    drm/i915: Introduce a gmbus power domain
    
    Currently the gmbus code uses intel_aux_display_runtime_get/put in an
    effort to make sure the hardware is powered up sufficiently for gmbus.
    That function only takes the runtime PM reference which on VLV/CHV/BXT
    is not enough. We need the disp2d/pipe-a well on VLV/CHV and power well
    2 on BXT. So add a new power domnain for gmbus and kill off the now
    unused intel_aux_display_runtime_get/put. And change
    intel_hdmi_set_edid() to use the gmbus power domain too since that's all
    we need there.
    
    Also toss in a BUILD_BUG_ON() to catch problems if we run out of
    bits for power domains. We're already really close to the limit...

"UPOWER-43001","notify::lid-is-closed not emitted","The attached test program shows something interesting.

UpClient's changed signal gets emitted when I close or open the laptop's lid.

However the notify::lid-is-closed signal doesn't get emitted at the same time.  But if I open/close the lid and call up_client_get_lid_is_closed() then *that* signal gets emitted and the function returns the correct value.

This means that UpClient notices the change and emits changed but doesn't update the properties and emit the corresponding GObject::notify signals until up_client_get_lid_is_closed() is called.

It *seems* that up_client_changed_cb() the callback from D-Bus could simply call up_client_get_properties_sync() but that could probably mean a bunch of roundtrips.  Still if clients use the changed signal they'll want to know the new state of some properties so the properties need updating anyway...

I've changed my code to use changed instead of notify::lid-is-closed and I'm fine with that it just was surprising to see the latter not emitted.",698,"1"

    Fill alpha on xrgb images.
    
    Do not try to fixup the alpha in the ff/shaders as this has the
    side-effect of overriding the alpha value of the border color causing
    images to be padded with black rather than transparent. This can
    generate large and obnoxious visual artefacts.

Looks like it happens when the graphical option  is enabled and set to maximum. If I reduce every other graphical options to the minimum but leave Texture LOD on maximum then the game crashes.

With Nvidia blob 340.76 the game runs stable for a long period of time even if I set everything to the maximum including anti-aliasing..

The crash occurs with the software renderer too.

    xfree86: vgaarb: fix device decoding interface to send resources type properly

    Right now when there is more than one vide card on the machine we're
    adopting a pessimistic approach and setting all cards to decode VGA legacy
    address.

    Some cards may want to skip the arbitration and the only way to do so is
    through pci_device_vgaarb_decodes. Therefore send the desired kind of
    resource instead force the worst case.

    Note that xf86VGAarbiterDeviceDecodes is not being used so far by any
    open-source driver. Even so API break.

"LIBREOFFICE-33484","Printing multiple files from Windows Explorer at once makes LibreOffice unusable","I was hoping that this bug got resolved in LibreOffice and since it still appears in 3.3.0 release I decided to re-file the bug in LibreOffice BugTracker (not sure if bugs from OpenOffice.org are investigated automatically).

This bug reflects OOo bug ID 113476: 

The problem has been described on the forums already. See here:

and here:


Always when multiple documents (no matter if spreadsheet or word processor files) are selected then right-clicked and print is chosen then only one document is printed. The Windows task manager will show then as many soffice.bin and soffice.exe processes as documents selected. For example  selecting 3 documents and trying to print them will open 6 processes (3x soffice.bin and 3x soffice.exe). All hanging indefinitely.

There is no LibreOffice window shown at all and processes seem to refuse shutdown signals when the user tries to log off so even logoff and shutdown is blocked. Users not familiar with the task manager will be unable to close down all processes manually in order to be able to continue working. While in this state (any soffice.bin and/or soffice.exe process running) it is impossible to open up any other LibreOffice application.

This is especially annoying if the user clicked many documents (e.g. clicking 30 documents will create 60 processes which have to be killed individually via task manager).

How to reproduce:
1. Create any ODF document
2. Create two copies of the document
3. Select all three ODF documents
4. Right-click the documents selected and chose print from the context-menu
5. Open Task Manager to see 6 soffice.bin/soffice.exe processes running

I guess it might be related to the instance detection feature of LibreOffice but I was unable to disable it (allowing multiple instances).

Work-around:
No clean work-around known to me.
I was trying to create a send-to script called print in OOo.cmd which passes all parameters to soffice.exe -p %*. Unfortunately then a limit of Microsoft applies which limits the number of arguments to 20. So printing more than 20 documents in one batch is impossible (my customer wants to print about 35). Moreover if one already tried the right-click->print action then even the send-to trick will not work any more due to already blocking soffice.bin/soffice.exe processes. Asking an inexperienced user to reboot will not work either since the PC will hang at reboot :-( so the only way is to ask for a system reset which is dangerous to do without clean shutdown.

This seemed to appear a few days ago after updating the obiaf ppa on Ubuntu 18. I did not have this problem before.

Basically any time certain programs are fullscreen the screen becomes corrupted and looks like a corrupted version of the login background however everything is still intractable and (I'm using Gnome) pressing the super key allows me to view the application and kill it. 
The view within (Whatever the application window thing is called) works and I can see the loading animations the start menu and everything which is how I have managed to get a few applications out of fullscreen and they work fine when not in fullscreen.

Attempting to screenshot the problem doesn't seem to work. LightDM also has this issue the screen looks the exact same with even the same colors. glxinfo is also attached. Not too sure what other information I need to include?

"WAYLAND-78190","protocol: Reporting damage in surface coordinates doesn't work with EGL","Currently the wl_surface protocol requires damage to be reported in surface coordinates.  However since EGL is unaware of any buffer-to-surface transformations that may have been applied through set_buffer_transform set_buffer_scale or wl_viewport it cannot report damage correctly.  In short:

 1) The EGL implementation has no way of knowing about buffer transformations.

 2) The EGL implementation is responsible to call wl_surface.damage inside of eglSwapBuffers.  Because it doesn't know about buffer transformations it can't damage a rectangle the same size as the surface.

 3) Mesa currently damages an area of INT32_MAX x INT32_MAX to deal with this.  However in the version 1.0 of the specification the surface size was always the same as buffer size.  Some EGL implementations (including older versions of mesa) rely on this and only damage the buffer size.  Therefore damage is wrong if the surface is rotated by 90 or 270 degrees.

 4) Clients have no way to determine if the EGL stack they are using does max damage or simply damages the buffer area.  Therefore they cannot assume that the EGL implementation will do the right thing.  (Especially since this used to be perfectly Ok.)  This also means that they can't detect whether or not surface transformations are useable.

It turns out that damage isn't an issue in the case where we have an integer buffer_scale or a transform that's a multiple of 180 degress.  This is because in these cases the buffer size is at least as large as the surface size and damaging bigger isn't a problem.  Using wl_viewport to scale up a surface however does coause a problem.

As far as I see it this leaves us with four options:

1) Clients call wl_surface.damage manually right before eglSwapBuffers.  The surface would always get damaged by eglSwapBuffers as well.  While the surface would probably get over-damaged it would at least ensure enough damage.

2) We add an EGL extension for every type of surface transformation.

3) We say that any EGL implementation that does not damage an area of INT32_MAX x INT32_MAX is broken and hope they change.

4) We change the protocol so damage is in buffer coordinates.

Option 1 breaks the whole idea of eglSwapBuffers and hiding stuff inside of EGLSurface and is really messy.  Option 2 is bad because we don't want to wait on EGL implementations before clients can use new protocol bits.

In my initial discussions with Kristian on IRC he was a much bigger fan of 3 and trying to hack around things in clients.  Initially we thought that we could just avoid 90 and 270 degree rotations unless we have EGL_EXT_swap_buffers_with_damage.  The idea was that eglSwapBuffersWithDamageEXT would simply pass the damage rectangles through to the compositor so it is then up to the client to hand it the right damage and buffer transforms would then be 100% ok.

Unfortunately EGL_EXT_swap_buffers_with_damage is even more broken than eglSwapBuffers in some sense.  When the EGL_EXT_swap_buffers_with_damage extension was written the authors trying to stay consistent with the rest of OpenGL chose to make the coordinates of the damage rectangles relative to the lower-left corner of the surface rather than the upper-left.  This means that the EGL implementation has to vertically flip all of the damage rectangles.  Normally this is a trivial operation.  However if the EGL implementation does not know the proper height of the surface the computed rectangles will be wrong.  This means that not only is eglSwapBuffers broken but eglSwapBuffersWithDamage is broken even worse.

Unless we start re-writing EGL extensions I think we're stuck with option 4.",1356,"1"

This seems to cause a crash in my application later on when allocating some other memory.

In depth_test_pixels the following code is executed:

GLuint zbuffer[MAX_WIDTH]
ASSERT(rb->DataType == GL_UNSIGNED_INT)
_swrast_get_values(ctx rb count x y zbuffer sizeof(GLuint))
depth_test_span32(ctx count zbuffer z mask )
rb->PutValues(ctx rb count x y zbuffer NULL)

The problem is that the first value in the 'y' array contains 512. Assuming the correct range is [0-511] this will cause an read outside the bounds of the texImage->Data array. The _swrast_get_values doesn't cause a invalid read since that function will actually do proper bounds checking before fetching values from textImage->Data. 

I'm not sure why the y array contains 512 so I'm not sure if it is a bug upstream (ie where the y array gets filled) or the PutValues should do proper bounds checking instead.",11,"0"

I was able to bisect the commit causing those lockups. The responsible commit is 	1c03a690bfc3265c7fefa7f87e69782a6672a9b2 radeonsi: use gpu_address from r600_resource.

There is no related message in the logs since the lockup is immediate and hard reset is required.

accessible-event listener

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a Writer document with spelling errors
2. Load the attached accessible-event listener in a terminal
3. Press F7 to start spell checking
4. Arrow around in the text widget displaying the error (Not in Dictionary)
5. Insert and delete text in the widget displaying the error

Expected results:
1. After step 3 the tree printed out would include an accessible object implementing AtkText which displays the error.
2. When steps 4 and 5 are performed accessible events would appear in the terminal

Actual results: Neither of the above happen. In particular:

[snip]
                -> [label | Not in dictionary]
                -> [scroll pane | Not in dictionary]
                    -> [panel | ]
                    -> [scroll bar | Vertical scroll bar]
                -> [push button | Ignore Once]
[snip]

And there are no accessible text events for that widget.

Note: The latter (no accessible text events) likely follows from the former (no accessible object). So were it me I'd start debugging the first issue and see if the second magically goes away when it is fixed. :)",20,"0"

"DRI-28713","[arrandale] Black screen on boot on HP Elitebook 8440p (eDP issue)","Forwarding a bug report from Ubuntu user Glen Ditchfield:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/589940

This is possibly a duplicate of fdo bug #28070.

Problem: 
Laptop monitor shows boot messages but turns black when gdm/kdm is started.

It seems that the laptop monitor is connected on DP1:
DP1 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 173mm
   1366x768       60.1*+   40.1  

From intel_reg_dumper: PCH_eDP_A: 0xb0854004

This is with Ubuntu 10.10 kernel 2.6.35-2.3-generic based on 2.6.35-rc2.


Original bug report:

I made a USB key and booted an HP Elitebook 8440p model WH255UT#ABA. (Chipset: Mobile Intel QM57 Express graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD.) I selected Try Kubuntu without installing. The screen flashed repeatedly then showed a blinking underscore cursor then turned black. After some seconds I heard the KDE start-up sound but the screen stayed black. Ctrl-Alt-F1 did nthing.

With splash removed from the boot options the result was the same.

merged into the xserver tree and mostly then found there way into

"DBUS-98157","format string vulnerability processing ActivationFailure messages","While trying to fix all the compiler warnings (Bug #97357) I tried enabling -Wsuggest-attribute=format and found this:

---

dbus-daemon listens for ActivationFailure signals coming from systemd. When running with --systemd-activation these signals are used to report that systemd could not activate a D-Bus service for us when not using --systemd-activation they are still processed.

dbus-daemon passes the human-readable message contained in these signals to dbus_set_error() where a format string is expected. In principle this could lead to arbitrary memory overwrite via a format string attack in the message received from systemd resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    
I believe this is not an exploitable security vulnerability on the system bus in practice: it can only be exploited by the owner of the org.freedesktop.systemd1 bus name which is restricted to uid 0 so if systemd is attacker-controlled then the system is already doomed. Similarly if a systemd system unit mentioned in the activation failure message has an attacker-controlled name then the attacker likely already has sufficient access to execute arbitrary code as root in any case.
    
However prior to dbus 1.8.16 and 1.9.10 due to a missing check for systemd's identity unprivileged processes could forge activation failure messages which would have gone through this code path. We thought at the time that this was a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2015-0245) this bug means that it was in fact potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

If you just looked at the COPYING file (like I did) you'd come away with the impression that you can't use D-Bus from a GPL version 3 program since neither of those licenses is GPLv3-compatible.

Suggested fix: append or later to that sentence.

Because of ID_MEDIA_PLAYER gvfs guesses content type of the mount to be x-content/audio-player (gvfs_udisks2_mount_guess_content_type_sync).  It is more natural to be x-content/ebook-reader instead but there is no rule to handle that.

"XORG-14373","xkb: Alternative layouts don't work due to groups invented by the server","The following configuration doesn't work with xorg-1.4.0.90:

Section InputDevice
    Identifier  Keyboard
    Driver      kbd
    Option      AutoRepeat    250 30

    Option XkbModel pc105
    Option XkbLayout dede(nodeadkeys)
    Option XkbOptions grp:caps_toggle
EndSection

Symptons:
When you press the a key you get an a when switched to one group but an æ when switched to the other group. Most other keys are broken too. The reason is that for all keys where the 2 layouts have identical mappings and which therefore should contain only 1 group (xkbcomp optimizes away identical groups) the server invents a 2nd group that contains the last 2 symbols from group1.

Example: Here is the symbol mapping of the a key as reported by xkbcomp :0 - after starting the server with the above configuration.

key  {
 type[group1]= FOUR_LEVEL_ALPHABETIC
  symbols[Group1]= [  a  A  ae AE ]
  symbols[Group2]= [  ae AE ]
 }

And here is how it should be

key  {
  type= FOUR_LEVEL_ALPHABETIC
  symbols[Group1]= [  a   A  ae   AE ]
 }

And this is indeed what you get when you issue the command 

setxkbmap -layout dede(nodeadkeys)

after the server has started. Why is this different? The 2 should be the same shouldn't they?

Unfortunately due to bug #14359 putting the setxkbmap command into .xinitrc can not be used as a workaround.",234,"0"

"DRI-23836","[KMS] sometimes freezes when resuming from suspend-to-disk","Bug description:
  I reported my bug in the Debian BTS: http://bugs.debian.org/545517
I recopy its text at the end of this report.
I was asked by the Debian xorg maintainer to also report the bug here. However reading the bug writing guidelines I see that I will not be able to provide all requested information. I disabled KMS and I've no time any more to re-enable it (more exactly I have not enough time to be able to recover from data corruption if it happens again for now)

System environment:
-- chipset: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960
-- system architecture: 64-bit (x86_64)
-- xf86-video-intel: 2:2.8.1-1 [2.8.1 rom Xorg.0.log] (from xserver-xorg-video-intel Debian package)
-- xserver: 2:1.6.3-1 [1.6.3 from Xorg.0.log] (from xserver-xorg Debian package)
-- mesa: 7.5.1-1 (from mesa-utils Debian package)
-- libdrm: 2.4.13-1 (from libdrm2 Debian package)
-- kernel: 2.6.31-rc6-amd64 (from Debian Kernel Team experimental packages)
-- Linux distribution: Debian unstable
-- Machine or mobo model: Dell latitude D630
-- Display connector: LVDS and sometimes DVI

Copy from the Debian bug report:
  I've tried KMS since about 2.6.30. I've seen support improved for each new
kernel version (each new rc for 2.6.31) however suspend-to-disk has always
problems.
  With older kernel version KMS and suspend-to-disk did not work at all.
With more recent kernel (as 2.6.31-rc6) KMS and suspend-to-disk seems to
work sometimes. However it happens sometimes to freeze at restart (just
after reloading the kernel state ie after the ... reloading ... 100%).
The laptop is then completly frozen the graphical screen is not correctly
restored and I do not see anything in the /var/log/syslog after next reboot.
  When the laptop is so frozen the only solution is to hard-reboot it.

  After several such freeze some ext3 corruptions have been found on my disks
(both / and /home). I do not know if they are due to the bug itself or to the
fact that I had to hard-reboot the machine.

  Nevertheless I removed KMS in my configuration and now I can use
suspend-to-disk without any problems. Summer break being ended I need to be
able to suspend-to-disk and not to have on-disk corruption. So I do not know
when I will be able to test KMS again. If other users experiment the same
problem this bug can be use to track the progress on it.

  For info my graphic card is (from lspci):
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c)

  Regards
    Vincent

PS: to enable KMS I only added
intel_agp
drm
i915 modeset=1
in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and recreated the initrd

Correct selection

When selecting faces in K-3D selections are fine in Mesa 7.0.1 but seem to go through the object in 7.0.3 (as obtained from ubuntu 8.04). The problem still appeared in the GIT version obtained a few days ago. The 7.0.1 shows correct behavior resulting in the front face being selected (red) when it is clicked. Doing the same operation in 7.0.3 (second screenshot) results in the bottom face being selected even though the front face was clicked. At the moment of the selection click the bottom face was behind the front face. It appears as though when in GL_SELECT mode Mesa gets the depth order wrong.

THe bug appears both in the VBO and non-VBO code for drawing faces. Selection in K-3D happens in GL_SELECT mode.

We should collapse all of their contents into LockFile/UnlockFile - and we should propagate the conseqences of 0 length and 0 size through the code.

_mesa_init_teximage_fields based on the texture's internalFormat specified by
the application. However the driver may want to choose an uncompressed format
instead of a compressed one or it may want to compress textures with e.g.
internalFormat=GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA which is not recognized as compressed right
now. In such cases IsCompressed ends up being clearly wrong and leads to weird
crashes later on. I suspect that wrong texture image sizes and/or row strides in
_mesa_store_teximage_... are responsible.

I believe texImage.IsCompressed and texImage.CompressedSize should be
initialized after the driver has chosen a hardware texture format and based on
that hardware format instead of the internalFormat specified by the application.

"MESA-97338","Black squares in the Spec Ops: The Line chapter select screen","Created attachment 125773
Screenshot showing the bug (frame 89)

With radeonsi the chapter select screen in Spec Ops: The Line has black squares that should not be there. I have not observed this bug elsewhere in the game (but haven't played through the whole game using radeonsi).

The number of squares increases with a higher texture quality setting. The number and positions of the squares only changes when the camera moves.

The chapter select screen renders fine using the amdgpu-pro driver - tested with version 16.30.3.306809 running on the upstream amdgpu kernel module.

Apitrace:
 http://constexpr.org/tmp/SpecOps-radeonsi.trace.xz (70 MiB)

This bug seems to be caused by pixels with NaN values that make it into the framebuffer and are extended to larger squares by a later post-processing pass: After draw call 1441551 pixel (875 573) of the COLOR0 attachment has RGB components set to NaN.

Presently that is the behaviour I see when Scale is triggered using a corner trigger or using a key binding that doesn't involve any modifiers (Ctrl Super Shift or Alt).

However when Scale is triggered using a key binding involving modifiers Scale mode exits as soon as I release at least one of the modifier keys. When triggered using a mouse binding Scale mode exits as soon as I release the mouse button that triggered it. This creates an odd situation where I must continue holding onto the mouse button that triggered Scale in order to select a window and exit Scale mode normally.

Would it make more sense for Scale mode to remain active until a window is selected or the trigger is re-invoked in all cases?",522,"1"

The problem seems to be that the monitor's EDID output describes a 135 MHz pixel

can't actually cope with that signal.  Forcing it down to 60 Hz appears to make

I have only tried with Mesa 7.8. Source code references below are against Mesa 7.8.2.

*** Description of the problem ***

Running under valgrind a program that does a glDrawArrays call using a GL_RGB8 texture I get this error:

==14218== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

==14218==  Uninitialised value was created by a stack allocation
==14218==    at 0x211699D8: fetch_texel (prog_execute.c:373)

Stepping in GDB through fetch_texel() I arrive at this location:
   opt_sample_rgb_2d at swrast/s_texfilter.c:1366

The code there does:

   for (k=0 k<n k++) {
      GLint i = IFLOOR(texcoords[k][0] * width) 
      GLint j = IFLOOR(texcoords[k][1] * height) 
      GLint pos = (j << shift) | i
      GLubyte *texel = ((GLubyte *) img->Data) + 3*pos
      rgba[k][RCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[2])
      rgba[k][GCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[1])
      rgba[k][BCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[0])
   }

It seems that it's leaving the alpha channel uninitialized.

When we look at the location of the first reported valgrind error using that
uninitialized value _mesa_convert_colors (image.c:5421) the source code is:


   case GL_FLOAT:
      if (dstType == GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE) {
         const GLfloat (*src4)[4] = (const GLfloat (*)[4]) src
         GLubyte (*dst1)[4] = (GLubyte (*)[4]) (useTemp ? tempBuffer : dst)
         GLuint i
         for (i = 0 i < count i++) {
            if (!mask || mask[i]) {
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][RCOMP] src4[i][RCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][GCOMP] src4[i][GCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][BCOMP] src4[i][BCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][ACOMP] src4[i][ACOMP])
            }
         }
         if (useTemp)
            memcpy(dst tempBuffer count * 4 * sizeof(GLubyte))
      }


The error line 5421 is the one converting the alpha channel:
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][ACOMP] src4[i][ACOMP])

This confirms the theory that the valgrind error is caused by the alpha value here being uninitialized.",0,"0"

Generate PDFs with correct font names

Cairo exports font names in their original form. But these can be wrong they can sometimes contain white space characters or PDF/PostScript delimiter characters. Such fonts are not common but they appear.

This can cause a problem when you are printing such file in evince. The printing fails during processing of an intermediate PDF because there are delimiter characters where they shouldn't be.

Attached patch escapes PostScript names of fonts (ps_name variable) right after these are loaded. It was already case for TrueType and OpenType fonts but not for pure CFF fonts. Type1 fonts were just shortened to the last correct character.

"DRI-94337","Linux 4.5 regression: FIFO underruns on Skylake","See previous discussion here: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2016-February/087710.html

On my Skylake laptop (Dell XPS 13 9350) I see relatively frequent FIFO underruns.  This only happens after suspend/resume -- I haven't seem them before the first suspend after a reboot.

My best guess is that this is the same issue as bug 93945 but that the fix for that bug didn't work on Skylake.  However I *do* see underruns while the cursor is visible but I don't seem to see them unless I've stopped interacting with the machine for a second or two.

The problem is still present in 4.5-rc6.  I'm using Fedora 23.

I can't dump VBIOS because i915 0000:00:02.0: Invalid PCI ROM header signature: expecting 0xaa55 got 0xffff.  I'll keep poking PCI maintainers about that.  intel_reg_dumper output is in the mailing list thread.",288,"0"

"MESA-97305","Gallium: TBOs and images set the offset in elements not bytes","I'm the main developer of Ogre 2.1

We're trying our demos in latest Mesa:
I've built Mesa from scratch. Tried commits git-edfc17a (current head of branch 12.0) and commit 17f1c49b9ad05af4f6482f6fa950e5dcc1a779d1 (current head of master branch)

Almost all of them work except for the compute shader based ones (Googling around it appears for Southern Island radeon it could be buggy so it was turned off. Not 100% sure but I think that's what's happening).
Anyway not a big deal on that. I understand the Mesa team considers that WIP. Move on.

However our Forward3D demo was glitching and I didn't know why. I've investigated the problem and located it:
* glGetIntegerv w/ GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT is returning 4 should return 256 for my HW (GCN 1.0 AMD Radeon HD 7770 Southern Islands).
* glGetIntegerv w/ GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT is returning 4 should return 256 for my HW.

In both cases 256 is what Windows drivers return btw including fglrx on Linux.

When aligned to 4 bytes the following worked correctly:
glTexBufferRange( GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER GL_R32UI boName offsetAlignedTo4ButNotTo256 sizeBytes )
uniform usamplerBuffer f3dGrid
uint numLightsInGrid = texelFetch( f3dGrid int(sampleOffset) ).x

But the following did not:
glTexBufferRange( GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER GL_RGBA32F boName offsetAlignedTo4ButNotTo256 sizeBytes )
uniform samplerBuffer f3dLightList
vec4 values = texelFetch( f3dLightList int(sampleOffset) ).x

The output of the latter was flickering garbage. When I forced 256 byte alignment it worked as expected.

I consider this a critical issue because I suspect it's causing subtle problems with a lot of titles whose buffer offsets don't start at 0.

I believe NVIDIA GPUs also require buffer offsets of 256. I don't know about Intel cards.",18,"0"

  again and among this I made a tags interface that I have
  been using to quickly find symbol definitions in the X Org
  tree.
o Xorgcfg is a program I wrote from start and I would like

I've confirmed that I'm still seeing interrupts from the device:

and (while hung):

Restarting X shows that the GPU isn't hung but I get lots of:

works too - I get rapid flicking between colourful screen and grey screen. If I then try to restart X11 (after running modetest) I get a complete system hang - no response to a PS/2 keyboard or on the network.

I'm going to try leaving the system running modetest instead of X and the GL compositor to see if that suffers a similar fate.",13,"0"

"MESA-105567","meson/ninja: 1. mesa/vdpau incorrect symlinks in DESTDIR and 2. Ddri-drivers-path Dvdpau-libs-path overrides DESTDIR","A meson/ninja install using option -Ddri-drivers-path overrides the DESTDIR variable and install to the path specified by -Ddri-drivers-path. Therefore files don't get packaged or logged with the files that do get installed to DESTDIR.

The above behaviour differs from an autotools build and install in which --with-dri-driverdir does not override DESTDIR.

Slackware installs dri modules in /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/dri.

Leaving -Ddri-drivers-path to the default value allows DRI drivers to be installed in the DESTDIR directory but then xorg-server will need to be recompiled to find the new DRI driver location.

Meson/ninja installing vdpau libraries (two bugs in one):

1.Symlink bug
If using DESTDIR variable WITHOUT -Dvdpau-libs-path then the symlinks libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0 libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1 libvdpau_radeonsi.so incorrectly point to ${DESTDIR}/lib64/vdpau/libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0 and not /usr/lib64/vdpau/vdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0.  Autotools building would have symlinked to /usr/lib64/vdpau/vdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0 when installing to DESTDIR.

2. DESTDIR bug/meson feature
If using DESTDIR variable WITH -Dvdpau-libs-path then all vdpau related files and symlinks install to /usr/lib64/vdpau/. Symlinks correctly point to /usr/lib64/vdpau/libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0.

Myanmar3 Keyboard Layout

The basic layout for Burmese included x11 is not flexible (easy to type) and not widely used for typing Burmese. Actually I can honestly say that nobody ever uses that layout.

Until now we are using a custom debian package which overwrites that basic layout (symbols/mm). But since ubuntu (dpkg?) disables overwriting files of other packages (though it can still be enabled using --force-overwrite) it is getting more troublesome to install for non-geek users to install.

I wonder if the installation directory should still be /usr/share/man/man3 (rather than /usr/share/man/man3bsd) but latter did not make my man find the man page out of the box any more (while former still does despite file ending .3bsd(.bz2)).  Also inside the man page the header still says section 3 e.g. HUMANIZE_NUMBER(3).  I would expect HUMANIZE_NUMBER(3bsd) here from a user point of view.

OS: Fedora 18.

Description of problem:
The current mingw header  pollutes the namespace with a '#define interface ...'.  While this is bad practice the dbus package should avoid the problems it causes by picking names that are less likely to collide in its function declarations or even omitting parameter names altogether (and just declaring parameter types without names).  I ran into this while trying to cross-compile libvirt for mingw.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
mingw32-dbus-1.6.8-1.fc18.noarch

The bug report here which was closed last December resembled my current issue:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2017-November/016236.html

I've thought about the possibility of it being DC-related as I saw similar bug reports but I was wrong as at one time I was able to reproduce it even after passing amdgpu.dc=0 during boot. The modules don't seem to be related as it happened on fresh installs where I left the screen blank (before I actually adjusted power management options) as I let it download and install packages I wanted in the background.

Additionally I'm able to find some additional errors prior to the crash which might have happened when the screen went blank. It could be done by simply locking the screen and leave it as is. (NOTE: When I locked the screen and then immediately move the mouse cursor to wake it up the crash would not occur. It would only occur if the screen went blank for at least 3-5 minutes.)

For now I could only prevent the panic from happening by not allowing power saving functions to happen especially anything that would turn off the screen. I'm also not allowed to lock the screen it would also blank the screen and the GTK+ greeter could blank the screen in its own way. 

However it's not feasible for running the system on battery for an extended period without any power saving feature given the high total TDP the laptop has and leaving the system unlocked is a bad idea in terms of security and privacy.

By the way given there were a few similar closed bug reports in the past I believe the problem might be a regression.",210,"0"

"DBUS-53499","dbus_address_escape_value may fail for bytes larger than 127","When I try to start pulseaudio and got the error message:

E: [pulseaudio] module-dbus-protocol.c: dbus_server_listen() failed: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.BadAddress: In D-Bus address percent character was followed by characters other than hex digits

I have tried to debug this and my understanding is that dbus_address_escape_value will fail to escape bytes with the high bit set when char is signed.

Pulsaudio creates a path to a socket under the home directory.  In my case with an o-diaeresis in the home directory name that path is

/home/göran/.pulse/bc6e8f186e8afde79d2ddb0047756edd-runtime/dbus-socket

The ö is UTF-i encoded that is \303\266 in octal.  Pulseaudio sends this to dbus_address_escape_value which passes it on to _dbus_address_append_escaped where it is traversed by a pointer with the type const char *.  When it reaches the first byte in the ö the \303 this byte is correctly considered needing escaping so it is sent to _dbus_string_append_byte_as_hex.

The argument with the byte in this function has the type int so the normal C promotion is made.  Since char is signed in my case it interpreted as -61 and this is the value used in the function.  When checking for the first hex number the index into hexdigits is byte >> 4 or -4 i.e. somewhere just before the array in the memory.  Apparently there happens to be \377 there this time.  Next it looks up the low four bits using the expression byte & 0x0f and that gets right since it completely disregards any sign extension.

The end result is this string.

/home/g%\377\063%\365\066ran/.pulse/bc6e8f186e8afde79d2ddb0047756edd-runtime/dbus-socket

Note that \063 is correctly the ASCII code for 3 and \066 means 6.  So the low hex digit are correct.  But dbus_server_listen is correct in complaining that the first byte after the percent signs are not hexadecimal digits.

PDF which shows the problem

When rendering the attached PDF with actual poppler some chars are not shown. Looking into it I figured out that the included truetype font has no cmap table and try the TrueType 'post' table to handle any unmapped characters is not working correctly because in FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() some chars were skipped.

With xpdf 4.00 the PDF is shown correctly.

Comparing poppler code of FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() with the xpdf code 4.00 I encountered that this bug was probably introduced with a patch I uploaded for bug 84270.

But reverting FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() from poppler to the xpdf 4.00 code doesn't only renders this PDF correctly it renders also the PDF of bug 84270 correctly.

And since the xpdf 4.00 code is cleaner I would prefer to take over this code again!",100,"0"

X log showing crash on a non KMS kernel

Using ati driver 6.2.99 (aka git shapshot as of 92baeafde8f0c1eed2b6769e96f8093e3d6d7478 (today)) works fine on a KMS aware kernel.
However if booting on a non KMS kernel where it failed to load the radeon kernel module it crashes trying to set up the 3D engine despte advertising disabling DRI.

Here /etc/modprobe.options contains options radeon modeset=1 and thus radeon kernel module failed to load because of the unknown option with a non KMS kernel.

logs shows a crash in RADEONInit3DEngine() despite DRI being disabled. See attache traces.

Card is radeon 9600 (RV350).
Xserver is 1.6.2. Mesa is 7.5. ATI driver is 6.2.99

Solution: do not try to init 3D engine at all if DRI is disabled for whatever reason it is.",54,"0"

"XORG-19608","Latest Intel driver (2.6) requests libdrm (2.4.4) - incomplete build directory","I'm having trouble installing the new Intel driver at http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2008Q4.html.
Specifically this is about xf86-video-intel 2.6.0 for an Intel GME965 chipset.
I'm running Fedora 10 2.6.27.9-159.fc10.i686.

I think it all stems from an incomplete libdrm installation due to a missing build directory (linux-core):

In libdrm-2.4.4 directory:
# more README 

    There are two main parts to this package: the DRM client library/interface
    (libdrm.so) and kernel/hardware-specific device modules (such as i915.ko).
    Compiling
    ---------
    By default libdrm and the DRM header files will install into /usr/local/.
    If you want to install this DRM to replace your system copy say:
	    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    Then
	    make install

    To build the device-specific kernel modules:
	    cd linux-core/
	    make
	    cp *.ko /lib/modules/VERSION/kernel/drivers/char/drm/
	       (where VERSION is your kernel version: uname -f)
    Or
	    cd bsd-core/
	    make
	    copy the kernel modules to the appropriate place


I did part one and everything completed normally.  Actually I added make to the process because that's the usual order of operations.
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    make
    make install

However I can't do part 2 because there is no directory called linux-core.  I did see a directory called shared core.  Here's the listing:

# ls
aclocal.m4    config.status  configure.ac  libdrm        libtool    Makefile.am  README
config.guess  config.sub     depcomp       libdrm.pc     ltmain.sh  Makefile.in  shared-core
config.log    configure      install-sh    libdrm.pc.in  Makefile   missing      tests

# cd shared-core/
# ls
drm.h       drm_sarea.h  mach64_drm.h  Makefile.am  mga_drm.h      r128_drm.h  radeon_drm.h  sis_drm.h     via_drm.h
drm_mode.h  i915_drm.h   Makefile      Makefile.in  nouveau_drm.h  r300_reg.h  savage_drm.h  via_3d_reg.h  xgi_drm.h

# make
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

-------------------
So one of two things should be fixed: the README file (maybe there is no part 2 any more) or the linux-core directory needs to be added.

Thanks!  Let me know if you need more info.

4) What happened instead is that when I choose hibernate it seems to attempt to hibernate then the computer shuts down. When I press the power button to come back from the hibernation the login splash screen comes up instead of the anticipated Locked splash screen. When I log in as the same user as I had when I hibernated it's a fresh desktop.

I have fixed it by adding supportNativeMonoRowData to ImgWriter.

xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1280x1024

everything goes okay except for the fact that the display doesn't get a signal. This can be remedied by executing some bit-banging:

radeontool regset FP_GEN_CNTL $((0x00034148 & ~0x0c07 | 0x0405))

Then the display is enabled however since the driver is unaware of this hack I have to execute it again after switching to the console or suspending. In addition to this the display keeps getting a signal so it won't enter a powersave mode.

I've tested this on Debian Sid with Xorg version 1:7.3-6 and xserver-xorg-video-ati version 1:6.7.196-1 from experimental (this should be almost up to date with git at the time of writing).

Fortify source is default since gcc-4.3 and thus default build is affected.

Since HAL_PATH_MAX=1024 is smaller then PATH_MAX=4096 this causes this abort.

All the resulting jpegs are the right size but have garbled colors. They look like solarized negatives: mostly black little color.

  wget http://www.swanyretail.com/SwanySkiCatalog_final-LO.pdf
  pdftohtml -f 1 -l 3 SwanySkiCatalog_final-LO.pdf swany.html'

Following is my analisys and a possible patch:

ModemManager tries to set default storages for MEM2 and MEM3 only with `+CPMS` providing an empty string for MEM1 argument::

     [1448531013.833175] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=MEME'

     [1448531013.967401] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:792] set_default_storage_ready(): Couldn't set default storage: 'Operation not supported'

Some modems do support NULL arguments (considering that as a request to do not change the correspondant value) but passing an empty string should be considered invalid since it is not a supported value::

     [1448531007.342611] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=?'
     [1448531007.389244] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): '
     [1448531007.418215] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): OK'

According to the previous logs only SM and ME are supported strings so the command should at most be `AT+CPMS=MEME`

However HE910 does not support NULL argument either so I made the following changes in order to provide always the current value of MEM1 if no other value is provided
this way the code works fine with HE910 and should work with the other modems too since it's conservative::

"SYSTEMD-65818","systemd gets stuck in loop with ConditionACPower in timer activated service","Created attachment 80900
backup service

I use the attached service and timer units for backup purposes. The service file contains ConditionACPower=yes because I don't want the backup to run when the power isn't plugged in.

This works as expected as long as the power is plugged in. If however the service is triggered by the timer while the power is unplugged systemd gets stuck in a loop. CPU usage by systemd goes up to about 75% systemd-journal up to 35% and the journal is flooded with the following message:

Jun 16 12:17:42 mus-laptop systemd[1]: Started Backup laptop

Every 10 seconds the following is logged followed by another few hundred Started backup-laptop messages:

Jun 16 12:17:52 mus-laptop systemd[1]: Started Backup laptop.

Note that this doesn't happen when I trigger the service manually only if it is triggered by the timer. The loop stops as soon as I stop the timer.

systemctl status backup-laptop shows the following while it is stuck in the loop:

    drm/i915: Increase WM memory latency values on SNB

    On SNB the BIOS provided WM memory latency values seem insufficient to
    handle high resolution displays.

    In this particular case the display mode was a 2560x1440@60Hz which
    makes the pixel clock 241.5 MHz. It was empirically found that a memory
    latency value if 1.2 usec is enough to avoid underruns whereas the BIOS
    provided value of 0.7 usec was clearly too low. Incidentally 1.2 usec
    is what the typical BIOS provided values are on IVB systems.

    Increase the WM memory latency values to at least 1.2 usec on SNB.
    Hopefully this won't have a significant effect on power consumption.

    v2: Increase the latency values regardless of the pixel clock

The actual terminal part of gnome-terminal 3.8 is an activatable service
so when run from there we pick up the real session bus' address via

(Yes it's DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS not DBUS_STARTER_BUS_ADDRESS. The

After upgrading to mesa-10.2.1 I began to see a lot of GL_INVALID_VALUE errors under kde eg

With mesa-10.1.5 no such errors occur. Modifying a MESA_DEBUG message in mesa-10.2.1/src/mesa/main/buffers.c:_mesa_DrawBuffers():303 to print actual values gives

I have a bunch of laptops mostly kinda old and several have radeon graphics controllers eg RV200/M7 [Mobility Radeon 7500]. It turns out that the MESA_META_DRAW_BUFFERS commit (specifically the Add infrastructure for saving/restoring .. commit) uses MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS and passes this value to _mesa_DrawBuffers():

For GPS utilties (again pretty far):

Due to lack of proper classification several software vendors started to use unofficial:

Spec should cleanly say which category should be used for this type of software.

Possible solutions:
a) keep everything as is document mapping software Categories: Geoscience or Geography (ugly)

b) Introduce new category: Mapping Maps or Navigation with allowed secondary categories Graphics Utility Education Science (and maybe Research see bug 20186)

b1) New category should be recommended for GIS as well.

b2) GIS can be documented as Geography or Geoscience

b3) GIS should be a new secondary category.

b4) GIS chould be related to Engineering

http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/873718

[Problem]
The external monitor flashes between black screen (1-15 seconds) and desktop (500 ms - 2 seconds). The problem started with Ubuntu 11.04 prior versions (9.04 - 10.10) worked fine.   Still occurs in Precise as of 12/17.

[Original Description]
Notebook: Amilo Si2636 Intel GMA 3100
ATEN CS1784 KVM switch
HP LP2475w monitor
Cables: Si2636 -> HDMI-DVI-D -> ATEN CS1784 -> DVI-I/DVI-I -> HP LP2475w

The external monitor flashes between black screen (1-15 seconds) and desktop (500 ms - 2 seconds). The problem started with Ubuntu 11.04 prior versions (9.04 - 10.10) worked fine.

Currently I'm running the monitor directly attached via HP-HDMI-cable. HDMI-DVI-cables make things worse (also tried cables with gold-plated plugs). Mainboard (most current BIOS) and HDD of the Notebook have been replaced in April RAM (3GB -> 4GB) at installation of Oneiric (64 bit) in November (I skipped 11.04 for permanent usage because of the video problems).

The Login-Screen is flickering and expanded to four tiles. Lower resolutions work stable for the Desktop but about every third boot the Desktop is viewable but flickers maybe every 10 - 30 seconds until reboot. After screen lock the monitor cannot sync anymore and displays check cable.

The KVM-Switch stores the EDID of the monitor permanently (pressing Numlock - d) and emulates monitor + USB in case K +V+M are switched to another port.

I tried Precise with no difference.

At 1680x1050 everything works fine but at monitor-native FullHD-resolution (1920x1200) the HP LP2475w flickers. And there's no difference between direct HDMI-HDMI connection and KVM-Switch. The dmesg of Oneiric is attached see 17:45 to 17:47 where I switched from 1680x1050 to 1920x1200 and back.

Screenshot of error in Firefox

Hi

I'm getting graphics errors and screen corruptions with the latest git-version of the intel-driver.

The bug is very easy to reproduce for me :

Just open Firefox and surf to the website www.windowsbase.de. Sometimes the errors are even worse and the xserver is crashing immediately.

The strange thing is that Google Chrome does not trigger this error but Epiphany Webkit does (Both based on Webkit). Perhaps a problem with Cairo?

When the main menu comes up the complete rendered background (not menu dialogs) is fading slowly to white (also ingame and benchmark).

If i append MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE=-GL_ARB_compute_shader to my steam start option there is no fading > the menu is rendered as expected.

I have made an apitrace and replayed it...
Without GL_ARB_compute_shader there are errors because Shadow of Mordor wants to use it but rendering LOOKS ok.
With GL_ARB_compute_shader the errors are gone but there is this white fading.

So I guess there is something wrong with GL_ARB_compute_shader!
Could someone look into this?

I use gnome-keyboard-properties to change my Alt/Win key behavior to be the
same as my control key. This works initially but fails over time. When I'm not
using the machine it doesn't fail.

Steps to reproduce:
1. gnome-keyboard-properties
2. Layouts tab
3. Keyboard model Apple (unnecessary I think)
4. Layout USA
5. Layout Options...
6. Alt/Win key behavior
7. Control is mapped to the Win-keys (and the usual Ctrl keys).
8. Use your computer for a few days it will work initially then fail.

Actual results:
I'll notice the alt/win key no longer works and then I run xmodmap -pke | grep
133 which shows:
keycode 133 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L NoSymbol Super_L

Expected results:
When the keys are mapped correctly I can run xmodmap -pke | grep 133 which
shows:
keycode 133 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L NoSymbol Control_L

Does this happen every time?
Yes in any given 72 hour period it will happen at least once. If I'm not
using my computer it doesn't happen.

Other information:
I'm using an apple A1048 keyboard I don't think that's related.
I've been having this problem for over a month I haven't been able to diagnose
a cause yet.
The workaround is to check change the Alt/Win key behavior back to Default
then change it back again.",48,"0"

    loader: introduce the loader util lib

    All the various window system integration layers duplicate roughly the
    same code for figuring out device and driver name pci-id's etc.  Which
    is sad.  So extract it out into a loader util lib.

    v2 (Emil)
    * Separate the introduction of libloader from the code de-duplication.
    * Strip out non-pci devices support.
    * Add scons + Android build system support.
    * Add VISIBILITY_CFLAGS to avoid exporting the loader funcs.

    v3 (Emil)
    * PIPE_OS_ANDROID is undefined at this scope use ANDROID
    * Make sure we define _EGL_NO_DRM when building only swrast

Steps to reproduce:

Launch an AT (NVDA Orca)

Launch LibreOffice
Navigate into the Thumbnail View list of the StartCenter with TAB keys. Use cursor keys to traverse any of the recent documents.  No accessibility focus events are fired.

"XORG-7535","Freetype2 pcf font problem also affects libXfont","From Marcus Meissner:

Not sure if you got this report already.

Matthew Barnes of Redhat reported a freetype2 crash which Werner
Lemberg of freetype2 also thought affects X own PCF reader.

I confirmed this my X.Org server crashes as soon as I (as
the logged in X user) do:
	xset +fp ~/badfont/
	xfontsel
with a SIGSEGV in strlen().

It is unclear if this problem can be exploited to execute code (it
crashes in a strlen() for me) but a crashing X server is not good either.

Werner Lemberg of freetype2 also writes:
BTW I've looked into the code of XFree86 4.3.0 (this is what I've
unpacked at home) and I see that there's virtually no protection against
malformed PCF -- our PCF developer originally took most of the code from
 xc/lib/font/bitmap/pcfread.c

git-version-gen: Honor GIT_DESCRIBE_FOR_BUILD environment  variable

The GNOME-OSTree build system currently creates chroots and bind
mounts to the source tree outside the root this means that we can't
necessarily run git inside the root because in the case of git
submodules the .git repository will point to outside root.

Also error out fatally if we fail to determine the version it
makes no sense to put UNKNOWN in e.g. the pkg-config files
since this will just cause errors later on.

Global application Options dialog in 3.6b3 with German UI

In LibreOffice 3.6 beta 3 for MacOS X (did not test Windows and Linux) if you install and select the German langpack the caption of certain buttons in different dialog windows begins with a spurious '~' e.g. ~OK and ~Abbrechen instead of OK and Abbrechen.

I can't test all LibreOffice dialogs but at least all instances of OK and Abbrechen in the (application) Options dialog and in Writer's Paragraph and Character dialogs are concerned.

This problem is brand new in beta 2 there was NO '~' at the beginning of these captions.

The problem is not present in the default (US English) locale there the same buttons have the correct captions OK and Cancel.

I will attach some screenshots showing the spurious '~'.

This is a minor issue but nevertheless it needs attentions because it makes LibreOffice look rather unprofessional and ugly.",130,"0"

"DBUS-98191","Fix -Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default warnings","+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #97357 +++

The patches on Bug #97357 include some for -Wswitch-enum and -Wswitch-default (Attachment #127058 Attachment #127059).

To make this more reviewable I would prefer to fix these two warnings as a unit but with each commit doing one thing by following this process:

* Land what's on Bug #97357 or use my warnings branch on Github as a base
  

* Enable the warnings locally but do not make them fatal by building with
  make CFLAGS=-Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default -Wno-error=switch-enum -Wno-error=switch-default

* Go through each affected switch or closely related group of switches
  (for example switching over values of the same enum can probably be
  grouped) fix both warnings at the same time and do one commit
  per group

* After all those commits add one commit removing -Wno-switch-enum and
  -Wno-switch-default from the AX_COMPILER_FLAGS* arguments so that this
  doesn't regress in future

I hope that makes sense.",179,"0"

I debugged the assertion with gdb:

"XORG-16259","Gnome panel flickers through into fullscreen SDL games","Short repro steps (using ubuntu hardy):
1. Add System Monitor as a gnome panel.
2. Install and run the game supertux (or basically any other fullscreen SDL game).

Detailed repro steps (for non-ubuntu users who want to see the bug):
1. Boot Hardy live CD.
2. Right click gnome panel in the top gray area maybe 2 cm left of the blue help icon.
3. Select the Add to Panel menu item
4. Select System Monitor (it's quite far down the list with greenish icon).
5. Add universe as source in apt (use System::Administration::Software Sources and check the checkbox called Universe).
6. Run sudo apt-get install supertux to install a SDL game.
7. Select Applications::Games::Supertux2

Expected results:
Gnome panel items should not engage in Z-order fighting with supertux while supertux is running in fullscreen.

Actual results:
Gnome insists on updating the panel CPU meter and also some other thing so basically two big black boxes appear along the top of the screen inside supertux. They just randomly flicker and it makes the game more or less unplayable.


Note 1: The same bug repros other games for instance you can try installing the Extreme Tux Racer game from the etracer package in Ubuntu.

Note 2: This is not a driver bug. I'm using a Intel X3100 GMA card with a 965GM chipset and this bug was confirmed by a guy who has a ati radeon 9550 card.

Note 3: If I set System::Preferences::Appearence::Visual Effects to None then the bug goes away. This is the way you turn of compiz in ubuntu so that's why I think this is a compiz bug.

Small errors in the layout margins of the text boxes. This is repeated in most default settings in the toolbar layout (from 3.6 to the new version 4.0).

In addition (and if so not by the way) there is ample space at the bottom (not proportional to the top). I suppose that space is reserved for footer (not all used) and this space could be dynamic (in the case that the user requires the lower space suits the new footer).

"XORG-93670","Reverse PRIME using two external screens on Nvidia card leads to Configure crtc 5 failed since xorg-server 1.18.0","Created attachment 120960
Short overview of the commands that lead to the issue.

System:
  Lenovo T530
  Intel HD4000
  Nvidia NVS5400 (optimus)

Kernel: 4.3.3-2-ARCH (Arch Linux)
Drivers used:
  xf86-video-nouveau
  xf86-video-intel

Internal screen and VGA output are wired to the Intel card.

Docking Station which provides 1xVGA 2x DVI and 2x DP outputs
=> The DVI/DP outputs are wired to the Nvidia card the VGA port is wired to the Intel card.

Intended setting:
- Internal Screen (LVDS1 1600x900)
- External Screen connected to first DVI port of dock (DP-1-2 1280x1024)
- External Screen connected to second DVI port of dock (DP-1-3 1280x1024)

---------------------------
|        |       |        |
| DP-1-3 | LVDS1 | DP-1-2 |
|        |       |        |
---------------------------


How to reproduce (using the Not working version setting:
  1. enable reverse PRIME: 
     xrandr --setprovideroutput nouveau Intel

  2. add left external screen: 
     xrandr --output DP-1-3 --left-of LVDS1 --mode 1280x1024
     # Left screen is switched on and aligned correctly.

  3. add right external screen: 
     xrandr --output DP-1-2 --right-of LVDS1 --mode 1280x1024
     # Right screen stays black and error message is showed in terminal: xrandr: Configure crtc 5 failed


Issue does not arise when:
 - using the packages from the Working version setting
 - using one external screen on the VGA port and one on DVI port.

"FREEDESKTOP.ORG-17378","mail routing problems","Once upon a time many years ago fd.o was using a version of postfix which was fairly broken -- for domains with an IPv6-only primary MX (as was infradead.org at the time) I believe would behave as if the primary MX had a Legacy IP address of '0.0.0.0'. Then it would bounce the mail since it believed that resolved to _itself_ and it had no knowledge of infradead.org as a local domain.

Rather than fixing postfix or switching to a non-broken MTA I believe a workaround was put in place -- just a hardcoded rule so that all mail to the infradead.org domain was routed directly to pentafluge.infradead.org ignoring the MX records.

That was fine for some years but pentafluge is being retired now and is no longer receiving mail. It's still on the MX list but it died last week for some reason and if it wasn't for the fact that fd.o is still trying to send mail there nobody would have cared.

Please can someone fix the mail routing?

Steps to reproduce:

Run any 3D game and set resolution to lower then native one in game menu (ie 1024x768 on a 1280x800 display) in fullscreen.
The game runs with 1024x768 resolution but is not maximized it is in the center of the display and the rest is filled with black color.

typical setup when dbus is considered stable enough to be built without

The problem is that dbus-signature.c unit tests do the following many times:

_dbus_assert (dbus_signature_iter_next (

This is incorrect because the operation executed within the assertion is not
idempotent i.e. it has side effects.  That operation advances given iterator. 
As a result if the code is built without assertions these lines are not
compiled which translates in the program not behaving as expected.

The solution is to call these operations outside the assertions and only assert
their results.  Doing so the test passes correctly (under NetBSD at the very
least) just as it does when assertions are enabled.",141,"0"

telepathy-glib does not register any non-standard type conversions so it's sufficient for our purposes if the conversion is always done in terms of the types that dbus-glib would use for a variant (so 'as' is always a GStrv 'a{sau}' is always a GHashTable> and so on).

    i965: always run the post-RA scheduler
    
    Before we would only do scheduling after register allocation if we
    spilled despite the fact that the pre-RA scheduler was only supposed to
    be for register pressure and set the latencies of every instruction to
    1. This meant that unless we spilled which we rarely do then we never
    considered instruction latencies at all and we usually never bothered
    to try and hide texture fetch latency. Although a later commit removes
    the setting the latency to 1 part we still want to always run the
    post-RA scheduler since it's able to take the false dependencies that
    the register allocator creates into account and it can be more
    aggressive than the pre-RA scheduler since it doesn't have to worry
    about register pressure at all.

Obviously some extra <![CDATA[ gets inserted here. I wonder where that comes from.

Can you run the sync again with syncevolution-1.1.99.6-1 and this time use a higher log level? On the command line use
   syncevolution --run loglevel=5 
or edit the ~/.config/syncevolution/default/peers//config.ini and increase the log level there.

What I'd like to see is the message dump (syncevolution-log_msg*incoming.[wb]xml) and translation into XML (syncevolution-log_trm*_incoming.xml). Is there already the CDATA in the incoming.wbxml?

I had a chance to discuss this with Ralf Becker at CalConnect. It is related to eGroupware bugs:
https://community.egroupware.org/egroupware/index.php?menuaction=tracker.tracker_ui.index&cd=yes

https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3020 is about the regression
https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2975 about the reason why it was introduced.

It seems that the bug was introduced in a attempt to fix escaping issues when using XML. But it broke WBXML because CDATA is now used unconditionally. The real fix must be to detect whether WBXML or XML are used instead of checking which client is talking to the server.

As a client-side workaround setting enableWBXML=0 should work.

Keeping this open must be fixed in eGroupware though.

Fix is available in the eGroupware code repository. Might not be in a formal release though.

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52897","relax need for template during configuration","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-03-22 06:40:26 +0000 ----

Currently SyncEvolution insists on having a template when creating a config from scratch. This was meant to address typos like --configure sheduleworld. But when the command line contains enough information no template is needed.

The same logic was applied to configuring a source: if a source is not among those defined by the template configuring it is rejected as a typo.

I suggest to add --template none as a special case. If that argument is given then SyncEvolution shall suppress the errors and create a config based on the command line properties (whatever those are).

If a source is among those which has command line properties it shall also be accepted.

If the sync properties contain the obligatory properties the need template error shall also be skipped. Obligatory at this time: only syncURL.

Examples:

--configure foobar => error need template
--configure --template none foobar => empty foobar peer config no sources configured
--configure ical20/backend=calendar foobar => foobar peer config with source ical20
--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => foo peer config no sources configured

> If a source is among those which has command line properties it shall also be
> accepted.

Clarification: backend=calendar is enough for has properties there's no need to explicitly specify the source name as in ical20/backend=calendar.

> Examples:
[...]
> --configure ical20/backend=calendar foobar => foobar peer config with source
> ical20
> --configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => foo peer config no sources
configured  

This is not implied by any of the rules above. Adding a rule that explicitly set properties of sources cause those sources to be created would be needed but that a) gets complicated and b) is inconsistent with the concept that these properties are merely filters which may or may not apply.

What I meant was this example:

--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => bar peer config no sources
configured
--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar ical20 => error about ical20
--configure syncURL=local://@foo backend=calendar bar ical20 => bar config with ical20 source
--configure syncURL=local://@foo ical20/backend=calendar bar ical20 => bar config with ical20 source

commit 21dd62cd7112a14340ee6a78e601fc02c7db8591
Author: Patrick Ohly 
Date:   Wed Mar 23 12:14:31 2011 +0100

    command line: relaxed checking of config creation (BMC #14805)
    
    SyncEvolution used to insist on having a template when creating a
    config from scratch. This was meant to address typos like --configure
    sheduleworld.  But when the command line contains enough information
    no template is needed.
    
    The same logic was applied to configuring a source: if a source was not
    among those defined by the template configuring it was rejected as a
    typo.
    
    With this patch there are two ways around these checks:
    - --template none and/or
    - specifying required properties on the command line
    
    This patch also removes the special cases for your SyncML server
    account name/password. Username/password aren't always needed
    (previous patch) nor are they always for a SyncML server anymore.

However there's

  Since the move to DeviceKit for karmic my removable VFAT-formatted disks are being mounted with shortnames=lower.

Past bugs -- e.g. https://launchpad.net/bugs/15525 and https://launchpad.net/bugs/76200 amongst others -- concluded that shortnames=winnt (or perhaps shortnames=mixed) was the correct setting and this was indeed the case in earlier releases.

  shortnames=lower appears to be set in devicekit-disks's src/devkit-disks-device.c.

The proposed patch is pretty straightforward just changing shortname=lower to shortname=winnt in src/devkit-disks-device.c. However we should have a consensus about this and fix it upstream or not at all.

A patch that fixes the ISO 639-2 alpha-3 code for the Uyghur keyboard layout [cn (ug)]

Hi Sergey

The attached is a patch that fixes a mistake I made in my last commit (bug 70639) where I incorrectly used the ISO 639-1 alpha-2 code (ug) instead of the required ISO 639-2 alpha-3 code (uig) in rules/base.xml.in for the Uyghur keyboard layout [cn (ug)].

Although this hasn't caused any problem in general use cases (typing as well as adding removing and switching from/to the keyboard layout) it did affect a library xklavier (https://developer.gnome.org/libxklavier/stable/index.html) which is employed by the Fedora (and the family) installer Anaconda (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) causing it to display the name of the Uyghur language incorrectly in its keyboard layout selection dialog when installing Fedora 21 Alpha.

I apologize for any inconvience caused by this.

"XORG-287","xdm won't run on non-IPv6 system if built with IPv6 support","Reported by Peter Breitenlohner  in a thread on devel@XFree86.org:

> I fully understand that XFree86 has to support IPv6. The current
> implementation has however a serious flaw: when compiled with IPv6 support
> (which is the default for most linux/gnu systems) the progams implicitly
> assume that IPv6 is supported by the kernel. In our case that is not so and
> in order to get things working I had to
> 	#define BuildIPv6		NO
> in xc/config/cf/host.def thereby permanantly disabling IPv6 support.

> It would be extremely helpful if one could compile XFree86 with IPv6
> support but then disable IPv6 at runtime via configuration files
> (resources) and/or command line options (in order to avoid various
> timeouts) and the programs should automatically fall back to IPv4 in case
> IPv6 is not supported by the kernel.

> The actual problems encountered were twofold:

> 1. xdm produced an error message
> 	chooser socket creation failed
> and there was just a useless parent process but no child process(es) and no
> Xserver was started. I think the lines 69ff in xc/programs/xdm/socket.c
> 	#if defined(IPv6) && defined(AF_INET6)
> 	    chooserFd = socket (AF_INET6 SOCK_STREAM 0)
> 	#else
> 	    chooserFd = socket (AF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0)
> 	#endif
> ought to be
> 	#if defined(IPv6) && defined(AF_INET6)
> 	    chooserFd = socket (AF_INET6 SOCK_STREAM 0)
> 	    if (chooserFd == -1)
> 	#endif
> 	    chooserFd = socket (AF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0)
> although I haven't tested this.

> 2. Trying to start chooser by hand lead to a segmentation fault! With a
> little tracing I found the following code in xc/programs/xdm/chooser.c in
> lines 844ff
> 	#if defined(IPv6) && defined(AF_INET6)
> 	    socket6FD = socket (AF_INET6 SOCK_DGRAM 0)
> 	#endif
> and later in lines 856ff

> 	    XtAddInput (socket6FD (XtPointer) XtInputReadMask ReceivePacket

    GL_INTENSITY has never been valid as a pixel format -- to get the memcpy
    pack/unpack paths the app needs to specify GL_RED as the pixel format
    (or GL_RED_INTEGER for the integer formats).

    mesa: Add support to allow blitting to multiple color draw buffers
    
    This patch fixes a blitting case when drawAttachment->Texture ==
    readAttachment->Texture. It was causing an assertion failure in
    intel_miptree_attach_map() with gles3 conformance test case:
    framebuffer_blit_functionality_minifying_blit
    
    Number of changes in this file look scary. But most of them are caused
    by introducing a big for loop to support rendering to multiple color
    draw buffers.
    
    V2: Fixed a case when number of draw buffer attachments are zero.
    V3: Put a for loop in blit_nearest() and blit_linear() functions in to
        support blitting to multiple color draw buffers.
    V4: Remove variable declaration in for loop to avoid MSVC compilation
        issues.

"DBUS-27110","Port DBus-Daemon to Windows CE","Hi

this is a series of patches porting DBus-Daemon to Windows CE using cegcc cross compilation under GNU/Linux.  As Windows CE only provides a limited subset of the Windows API and an even more minimal and broken subset of the POSIX'ish Windows API I approached this port in the following way: Convert the existing Windows port fully to the Windows API replacing remnants of Unix-ish interfaces (_open _mkdir _readdir etc) by their Windows-ish counterparts (CreateFile CreateDirectory FindNextFile etc).  The advantage is that this makes the port more uniform and also avoids confusion (for example POSIXish checking of return values of Windowsish interfaces as happened for MoveFileExA).  If you are not with me on this design decision the whole set of patches needs to be abandonend (or rather: reworked).  The alternative I can think of is implementing the POSIXish interfaces for Windows CE but that may be messy as this may conflict with what's there already.  Please let me know if you feel strongly about this.

I have isolated the changes to the Windows port in a first patch (0001).  This patch is tested not to break the Windows build (the unit tests dbus-test complete successfully and a KDE program still works).  Issues addresses are among others: Use of Windows API instead of POSIXish APIs indirect use of errno (which does not(!) exist in Windows CE and needs to be replaced by Set/GetLastError).

The second patch (0002) makes more code that depends on signal.h and locale.h conditional.  These header files and associated interfaces simply don't exist on Windows CE.

The third patch (0003) adds Windows CE detection to configure.in and also adjusts the winsock library (it's -lws on CE instead of -lws_2 on NT nobody seems to know why this is different).

The fourth patch (0004) then fulfills the promise of the 0001 patch and implements the parts of the Windows API that are missing on Windows CE.  Notably it provides wrappers for the ASCII variants of the interfaces as Windows CE only has Unicode interface variants.  The alternative to switch the dbus code base to unicode is too invasive for this port (but would make large parts of this patch obsolete).

The fifth patch (0005) is an unfortunate work around for a discrepancy of the Windows NT and Windows CE command line parser in the wrapper around main() [Windows standard is to have WinMain as entry point which gets a command line string that is then parsed by the application.] Windows CE and NT have different ideas how to break the cmdline into strings for argv.  In particular Windows NT expects the first component of the cmdline to be the program name (argv[0]) while Windows CE gets the program name from the ModuleName and expects the first component of the cmdline to be the first argument (argv[1]).

The sixth patch (0006) ports the dbus-monitor.c program from tools.

The seventh patch (0007) adds a README.wince to the root directory with further information on the port.

The eighth patch (0008) includes a patched version of libtool for the build.  Current versions of libtool unfortunately don't support Windows CE cross-builds correctly: The libtool wrapper programs do not compile for this platform and there is an error in the detection order.  Note that this patch would become obsolete by upgrading to an upcoming working libtool version (our changes needed for WinCE have been submitted and accepted upstream).

I also have a port of the dbus-launch tool in the works but I want to clear the queue before cleaning that up.  I will append it to this bug report shortly.",88,"0"

    drm/i915: Create a more generic pm handler for hsw+

    HSW has some special requirements for the VEBOX. Splitting out the
    interrupt handler will make the code a bit nicer and less error prone
    when we begin to handle those.

    The slight functional change in this patch (queueing work while holding
    the spinlock) is intentional as it makes a subsequent patch a bit nicer.
    The change should also only effect HSW platforms.

Hello

Problem description:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) hangs the GPU.


Expected Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) should not hang the GPU.


Obtained Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) freezes the system for a few seconds but afterwards (3 sec. approx.) I can close the application that caused the GPU hang.
Video output is non-existing in Cheese or Guvcview (I only see the black window where the video should be).
If I still try to take a picture with Cheese for example it will capture the photo correctly!
When playing a movie file I get no video (only sound output is available).


When does it happen: Always (no special steps are necessary to reproduce this error).

two faults

I know others have seen this error but I'll add it if folks want the logs.

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 the kernel is drm-intel-nightly but I ran into compile issues with libdrm so everything else is the latest Ubuntu.

Some more details
arch: x86_64
kernel: 4.6.0-rc2+ (drm-intel-nightly from 4/4/16)
Machine: NUC6I5SYH (i5-6260U)
Display: HDMI & DP

First I captured dmesg & card0/error without the drm.debug command line option this is the f1 folder in the bz2 but then I saw the note about wanting that so the f2_dbg_cmdline folder is with drm.debug=0x1e log_buf_len=1M

In both of these cases the screens freeze but the mouse continues to work then about 10-20 seconds later it comes back to normal. There is a message in the lower right corner KWin Window Manager desktop effects were restarted due to a graphics restart I've also had instances where both the screens & mouse freeze and when this happens a reboot is needed even ssh doesn't work.

The glsl2 compiler errantly accepts fragment shaders that use the texture2DLod() function.  This function was added as a frag shader feature through the GL_ATI_shader_texture_lod extension (undocumented?  google it) but it's not standard GLSL.

There are some built-in functions that only apply to vertex shaders or fragment shaders but I don't see how/where the glsl2 compiler makes any distinction.

I'm attaching a piglit shaderrunner test for this but I don't see a way to indicate to shaderrunner that a shader should NOT compile.

Journal log with kernel 4.7-1 using intel driver

I have a desktop machine (Intel Ivybridge DQ77KB ) and running Arch linux. After update to kernel 4.7.0-1 with the usual pacman -Syu my desktop initially boots up fine and presents the sddm greeter screen as normal - but when logging in the usual splash screen appears on the monitor with the progress bar moving across but at around 90% through this process the plasma login seems hangs for many seconds - eventually the splash screen disappears and I end up with just the desktop background image - but no taskbar and the mouse becomes active again after being unavailable whilst the progress bar and splash are on the screen. Once the mouse is active again and I can select the usual options with right click including the logout option. Rebooting makes no difference and logging out and back in also makes no difference.

Downgrading the kernel back to 4.6.4-1-ARCH allows my plasma desktop to login normally again - so this looks like a possible bug in the 4.7 kernel Intel driver.

I ran some more tests. If I update to kernel 4.7-1 and then remove the xf86-video-intel package and remove the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf so that the system uses the modesetting driver instead of the intel driver then the system boots to a normal graphical sddm login screen and logging in completes to give a normal plasma desktop including the taskbar. However the Kickoff menu opens in a strange way with it seems items off the left of the screen so that they are not accessible. Also if I start the chrome browser it appears to start but is not on the screen - again possibly it is trying to place the chrome window outside of the screen area. So although the graphics partly works it is not usable. 

The versions of key packages are:

"MESA-91130","Mesa's cl.h defines CL_VERSION_1_2 even though it is missing some OpenCL 1.2 functions","`clEnqueueFillBuffer` is part of OpenCL 1.2 [1] [2].

Mesa claims to support OpenCL 1.2:
```
# grep -B1 CL_VERSION /usr/include/CL/cl.h
/* OpenCL Version */
#define CL_VERSION_1_0                              1
#define CL_VERSION_1_1                              1
#define CL_VERSION_1_2                              1
```

It declares `clEnqueueFillBuffer`:
```
# grep -B1 -A8 clEnqueueFillBuffer /usr/include/CL/cl.h
extern CL_API_ENTRY cl_int CL_API_CALL
clEnqueueFillBuffer(cl_command_queue   /* command_queue */
                    cl_mem             /* buffer */ 
                    const void *       /* pattern */ 
                    size_t             /* pattern_size */ 
                    size_t             /* offset */ 
                    size_t             /* size */ 
                    cl_uint            /* num_events_in_wait_list */ 
                    const cl_event *   /* event_wait_list */ 
                    cl_event *         /* event */) CL_API_SUFFIX__VERSION_1_2
```

But does not define it:
```
# scanelf -s clEnqueueFillBuffer /usr/lib/libOpenCL.so
 TYPE   SYM FILE 
ET_DYN  -  /usr/lib/libOpenCL.so 
```

Logically it also seems to be missing in the API dispatcher [1].

I assume Mesa should not claim to support OpenCL 1.2 via `CL_VERSION_1_2` if at least one of the OpenCL 1.2 functions is not implemented.

mouse cursor corruption photo 01

Distribution: Arch Linux
Hardware: AMD A10-7850K Kaveri APU
Kernel: 3.11+ (needed for Kaveri KMS support).

Description: After launching weston on AMD Kaveri APU (or similar) mouse cursor gets corrupted. 

The bug was initially reported to kernel bugtracker: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77531

The conclusion was that weston assumes 64x64 cursor size when this hardware support only 128x128.

Steps to reproduce:
- Launch weston (tested with 1.4+).
- Mouse cursor gets corrupted.",345,"0"

This affects both 1.1.2 and current master.

This does not happen in a 64-bit chroot (I haven't tried a 32-bit kernel as I don't have one set up).

Greetings

I recently got a second display and have been experiencing reliable GPU lockups when starting full screen games on one of the displays. The steps to reproduce go as follows:

  1) Run gnome-shell 3.8.4 as your desktop interface (this is sufficient at least)
  2) Have a multi-monitor setup
  3) Start a full screen game that only appears on one monitor

The result is several lockups that are eventually freed and errors in dmesg and such. I believe that OpenGL acceleration of the desktop is a necessary prerequisite as this behavior doesn't occur in say fluxbox. But I've observed the behavior with multiple games some of which don't (I think) use OpenGL. At the least I've seen it with Awesomenauts (which may be using OpenGL) and Icewind Dale running in wine (which I would suspect isn't but I may be wrong).

This is definitely related to multi-monitors as well because if I disable one monitor in the gnome system settings the problem goes away. Also if the game does full screen by switching the monitors to mirror one another the problem will not occur (probably because that is equivalent to a single screen setup). I observed this with Battle for Wesnoth.

I had thought this was related to Bug 54226 but was informed that this was unrelated and should post a new bug.

I'll attach my Xorg.0.log dmesg and /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_error_state from after a lockup.

"PULSEAUDIO-54096","Problems with volume control in VIA VT1708B 8-Ch","Created attachment 66151
x = alsamixer pecentage for the PCM control. y = corresponding volume in dB.

I have an ASUS P5KPL-1600 motherboard with a VIA VT1708B 8-Ch chip managed by snd-hda-intel. The volume control in pavucontrol Gnome's sound preferences and all apps with flat-volume enabled is too non-lineal and just plain wrong.

alsamixer has two useful controls for output volume:
PCM: goes from -40.25dB in 0% through 0dB in 53% to 14dB (*with clipping*) in 100%. (This is not linear at all see graph.png attached.)
Master: goes from 0dB in 0% (very quiet output) to 6.75dB (without any clipping loud and clear) in 100% with 0.25dB = 3.75% increments.

When in PulseAudio 2.1 I set the volume in 100% it maxes out both PCM and Master so I get a quite distorted sound. This is expected but the scale is wrong: 100% is 0dB but it should be 14dB.

The base should be at -14dB or 58% when PCM is at 0dB (53%) and Master at 6.75dB (100%) but it is at -20.75dB (45%) with Master and PCM at 0dB with very quiet output. The difference in sound pressure between 45% and 53% is very large.

Between -20.75dB (45%) and -68dB (7%) the volume does not change at all. All controls in alsamixer remain the same.

Between -68dB (7%) and -108.24dB (2%) the PCM control goes down to zero and any less than that results in muted output.

This behaviour is quite strange and I don't know how much of it is pulseaudio's fault how much is the alsa driver's and how much is mine.

Hi
the attached patch changes configure to also check for __uint128_t which is the new name of uint128_t from gcc. It is only available on architectures that provide instructions for 128 bit integers.

(I had to move some code in cairo-wideint.c because apparently nobody compiled with a gcc that has uint128_t since a very long time and macros/functions were not defined)",0,"0"

With previous versions there had been minor corruption on some parts of the screen temporarily and very occasionally it would lock up.

With 2.5.0 the entire screen is corrupted and looks like a very colorful static.  You can make out some things on the screen faintly.  The xserver hard locks after trying to type some.

Playing a video in mpv with the '--hwdec=vdpau' option the player window is created but the application becomes unresponsive and the video never starts. Similarly in Kodi playing a video with VDPAU enabled causes Kodi to become unresponsive to user input and the video never starts.

Strangely VLC can still play videos with VDPAU enabled.

I'm automatically getting the latest git updates through the Oibaf Ubuntu PPA. The problem first occurred somewhere in March or April when VDPAU videos /sometimes/ wouldn't start or took a long time to start (as opposed to the current situation where videos no longer start at all) and going back to the much older Ubuntu 'stock' driver solves the problem.

The warnings can be fixed by either using & 0xffs or static_cast()s to instruct the compiler that truncation of >8-bit values to 8 bits is intentional e.g.:

#define hb_be_uint16_put(vV)	HB_STMT_START { v[0] = (V>>8) v[1] = static_cast(V) } HB_STMT_END
#define hb_be_uint32_put(vV)	HB_STMT_START { v[0] = (V>>24) v[1] = static_cast(V>>16) v[2] = static_cast(V>>8) v[3] = static_cast(V) } HB_STMT_END

(Note that if callers might pass larger types to the first two macros than uint16_t and uint32_t respectively it's necessary to add static_cast()s on the v[0] assignments as well.)",16,"0"

There seems to be a few different problems

a) in fcxml.c when we pop off FcPopValue it looks to me that we should call
FcValueDestroy on the returned value
b) in fcpat.c when we check to see if a string can be deleted we check to see if
the string is hashed and if it is in the hash then not delete it but when a
string gets hashed a copy is taken of it so the original string becomes
undeletable afterwards. Presumably the intention is to see if the string to be
deleted actually belongs to the hashtable and not delete it in that case
c) in fcxml.c we push a FcVStackPushPattern(parse FcPatternFreeze(pattern)) a
frozen pattern has a ref of -1 and can't be deleted normally with
FcPatternDestroy. I'm unsure of what the proper course of action here is.

Patch attached to address this but part 2 of chunk 2 for c) is probably total crack",7,"0"

"WAYLAND-79609","VT switching crashes Xwayland and weston","Xwayland will crash under some actions on my computer.

Steps to reproduce:
1. weston-launch from a VT
2. Start weston-terminal
3. Launch an app that needs X from weston-terminal (glxgears for example)
4. Switch to another VT and switch back
5. Move mouse onto the X window (glxgears)

Then that X window will fade out (crashes) after the X window fade out completely weston will crash too.
It is 100 percent reproducible on my machine

Since the texture coords are calculated in the vertex shader it's possible the bug is in the interpolation?

Image 8177x1 pixel make firefox crash

Hi

with Nouveau image greater than 8176 pixel make firefox (2.x and 3.0) crash with this error :

The program 'gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 2281 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

"XORG-20118","xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball doesn't build on Debian lenny","Hi all --

I have a Sony Vaio PCG-R505ECX with the Intel 82830 CGC video system which I have recently upgraded to Debian lenny and was having some strange video corruption issues.

As a sanity check on the hardware I wanted to try a different video driver for the same chipset and soon found my way to the driver at http://www.intellinuxgraphics.com whose latest stable release is the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0.tar.bz2 download.

This file would initially not configure due to a requirement for libdrm version 2.4.4 but the same page provides the tarball for this version of the library and it built fine on my system using ./configure --prefix=/usr/local make make install.

Subsequent to this the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball would then configure but it would not build.  The makefile gets an error attempting to build i830_lvds.c.  The error starting from the build line for the problem file is:

  Debian lenny has version 7.1 of the X.org server and provides the associated header files and so forth in a -dev package.

  Is this just too old of an X.org installation to build this driver?  If so can you point me to an older version of the driver?  The chipset in question is rather old so I don't imagine there's a real requirement for new software but I was unable to find any archives of previous xf86-video-intel tarballs which might work.",4,"0"

In 2.6.32 the system works reliably with or without the plug in card providing dual channel

In 2.6.35 X fails. Interestingly (this is Fedora 14) you get the graphical bootup display just fine but not the X after it

Just pre 2.6.38-rc1 it oopses but the oops seems fixed

In 2.6.38-rc1 it's even worse and you don't get that either in fact the moment KMS triggers it goes to pot

I've tested both the failing case with our without dual monitors with or without monitors plugged in and from cold or warm boot. The behaviour is somewhat erratic - different kinds of fail etc.

Bisecting doesn't seem to help - it just produces a series of kernels that don't boot or fail due to other problems - seems the bisect distance is just too great to be useful.

It's not the userspace that makes the difference - FC14 X was used in all cases.

The box produces mtrr warnings but removing those by cutting down RAM etc don't change the behaviour",0,"0"

Simple python app for monitoring and changing the engine clock

When the Xfce desktop is visible at 4K and idling the engine clock is fixed at level 6: 1220MHz and you can not change that. The temperature is 38 C. The automatic power management works with 2560x1600 and lower resolutions. I tested with my python app and I have latest drivers including firmware files. My monitor is ASUS VP28UQG and I use the display port.

proposed fix

When a input device with only buttons is present (e.g. BTN_0..BTN_9) in Xorg.log I can see the following:

evdev: Huion HA60-F400 Tablet Pad: Device: /dev/input/event3
evdev: Huion HA60-F400 Tablet Pad: Vendor 0x256c Product 0x6e
evdev: Huion HA60-F400 Tablet Pad: Found 16 mouse buttons

evdev: Huion HA60-F400 Tablet Pad: Configuring as mouse

evdev: Huion HA60-F400 Tablet Pad: EmulateWheelButton: 4 EmulateWheelInertia: 10 EmulateWheelTimeout: 200

However xinput list will show the device listed as a slave of Virtual core keyboard. As a consequence GIMP fails to show this device in the extended input device dialog (don't ask me why) and Plasma5 crashes when you do xinput test  (also don't ask me why). Anyways if it is Configuring as mouse I would expect it to be a slave of Virtual core pointer.

A inspection of the evdev driver revealed a small mistake: the relative X and Y axes are added to the device but EVDEV_RELATIVE_EVENTS flag is not set. This leads to the above described effects.

The small attached patch fixes this.",2,"0"

At line 272 of hw/xfree86/common/xf86Events.c FD_CLR() is called using the fd from pInfo->fd. To get to this line of code pInfo->fd must be sane (>= 0) in line 262. However the evdev driver's read_input function called in line 266 through pInfo->read_input() sets pInfo->fd to -1 under some set of conditions. This causes the FD_CLR to crash Xorg.

Possible solutions:

1. Move the FD_CLR above the pInfo->read_input() call
2. Fix the evdev driver if it shouldn't be invalidating pInfo->fd

Here's the gist of my reproduction scenario: I'm the developer of launchpad.net/rinput. It's a server that listens for remote input event clients. The clients tell the server what kind of input device they are (keyboard mouse etc.) and the server creates a new Linux uinput device for the client. The client sends input events to the server which sends them through uinput to the kernel and eventually back up to Xorg. I connect to the server up to about 10 times per day and every few days the events stop propagating through Xorg. When I kill rinput Xorg crashes. I used one of the crash dumps to determine where the issue was.",6,"0"

When I contacted Paul Brian it worked for him however he ask if I am using 32bit version. When I tried 32bit version reflections worked but very slow.

Looks like there is some kind of bug that shaders work for 32bit systems users while they dont work for modern 64bit systems.
