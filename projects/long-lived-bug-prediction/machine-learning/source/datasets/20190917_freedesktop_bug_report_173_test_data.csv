Link is to a small sample clip (28mb 50sec hd-ready anime). This clip demonstrates the three 'types' of artifacts described above. 
In the first few seconds of the clip the video appears normal.
Then there is a flashback which starts out normal too but after a scene change there appear heavy blocking artifacts. It is hard to tell if only the color of the blocks if off or if (some of) the actual contents are wrong too. I'm inclined to say the former is the case (only the color is off).
After the flashback returns to the present time there is some mild blocking (especially evident when the woman turns her her head).

---- Reported by jku@linux.intel.com 2011-06-17 08:22:26 +0000 ----

NetworkManager 0.9 implements the same org.freedesktop.NetworkManager API but has completely changed the State property values.

NM <= 0.8:
 NM_STATE_UNKNOWN = 0
 NM_STATE_ASLEEP = 1
 NM_STATE_CONNECTING = 2
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED = 3
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTED = 4

NM == 0.9:
 NM_STATE_UNKNOWN = 0
 NM_STATE_ASLEEP = 10
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTED = 20
 NM_STATE_DISCONNECTING = 30
 NM_STATE_CONNECTING = 40
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_LOCAL = 50
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_SITE = 60
 NM_STATE_CONNECTED_GLOBAL = 70


I'll write a patch for setting the HTTP presence value to TRUE when NM state is [0 3 50 60 70]. That should cover it:  0 and 50 (link local connection) are probably not going to work but better to be conservative here.



---- Additional Comments From jku@linux.intel.com 2011-06-17 10:15:58 +0000 ----

I found another bug in the NM status code. Fixes are in jku branch -- do not merge the whole branch though it has work-in-progress webdav commits as well.

Let me know if you'd rather have patches or another branch...

    Specify interface name in NM DBus GetProperty call
    
    NetworkManager 0.9 is more strict about the call arguments: it seems
    newer dbus-glib requires that the interface name is specified otherwise
    there is an AccessDenied error.

    Update NetworkManager Status-handling to 0.9 API
    
    NetworkManager 0.9 changes the values of
    org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Status property. Fortunately the new
    and old values are not in conflict.
    
    Commit also starts setting presence to false only when we know this
    should happen (and not the other way around): It's better to fail
    this way than prevent user from syncing if things like this happen.

  * pop up a new ClientHandler head with a specific filter
  * Request the channel with the CLientHandler head as the preferred handler

In some cases this handler doesn't actually get the channel. From the looks of it this happend because MC starts dispatching the channel before it has finished introspecting the recently popped up handler which means that it's unaware of the specific filter and ignores the preferred handler.

Two potential solutions for this:
  * Always give it to the preferred handler even if its filter is unknown (or 
    even if it doesnt match?)
  * When dispatching a channel with a preferred handler block dispatching   
    until the preferred handler has been fully introspected",61,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-66145","Turning off 'Same content on first page' does not reflect in UI","Problem description: 
When creating a new document in LO (or opening an existing one) - if you go to the 'Page Style' configuration and go to the 'Header' tab and uncheck the 'Same content on first page' - you expect to be able to edit the first page's header different than other pages' headers. but in fact - they still edit together.
However when saving the file and reopening it - you see different headers. so this is a UI bug.

THIS IS A REGRESSION BUG (it worked in version 4.0).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Writer (new document)
2. Make sure you have 3 pages at least.
3. Turn off 'Same content for first page' in the 'Header' configuration.
4. Edit the header of the 1st page (it will show in other pages too - bug).
5. Edit the header of the 2nd\3rd page (it will show in the header of the first page too - bug).

Current behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the headers of all pages are still 'linked' and edit together.

Expected behavior:
After turning off 'same content on first page' - the header of the 1st page should be independent from the headers of the rest of the pages.

"XORG-9790","[modesetting] XVideo doesn't work because of double-wide mode","After a recent update to the head of the modesetting branch XVideo stopped working for me.  In the server log file I get an error:

Disabling XVideo output because Pipe A is in double-wide mode

(I'll attach a complete log file).

I checked the source and there's a code in i830_display.c with an accompanying comment that explains that the driver switches pipe from single- to double-wide mode (whatever they may be) if the dot clock is >90% of the core speed.

I'm using a 20 widescreen flatpanel with a resolution of 1680x1050 which needs 146.2 MHz dotclock.  It's connected to an I855GM-equipped laptop and the code assumes that the core speed is 133 MHz so obviously the code will trigger the double-wide mode case and disable XVideo.

However I've been running a version from the modesetting branch that I checked out in September 2006 and that version *did* support XVideo in that mode.  I compared the source and the old version appears to have lacked the code to turn double-wide mode on.

So I commented out in the latest version the code that turns double-wide on and tried (I'll attach the patch).  XVideo now appears to be working flawlessly for me.

I don't know if the code is broken or the docs are simply overly conservative or if I'm doing something that is not supposed to work but I just happen to be lucky.  If you decide that it's the last option I'd at least appreciate if you could add a driver option that allows one to override the automatically selected mode as obviously single-wide mode works for some people and being able to use hardware acceleration when watching movies sure is useful (that's what I bought the external monitor for :-).",18,"0"

"DRI-101127","[HSW PWM] Brightness range not same as (correct) inverted brightness range.","A long time ago (I *think* around 4.8/4.9) I noticed that my usual PWM values no longer corresponded to the physical amount of light produced by my screen.
A value of 1/937 which used to be ultra-dim was quite bright.
The cause of this was never found (Various PWM/brightness related commits at that time reverted to no avail).

Today I decided to try and invert the brightness via 'invert_brightness' in sysfs and set the brightness to 936/937 - and there was the old ultra-dim brightness I have seen before at 1/937.

What I think is happening is that the PWM range is shifted up causing the lowest PWM value to correspond to ~40+ of the old correct range.
The highest PWM value seems to still clamp to 937 as that seems to be the hw limit.

This causes the whole PWM range to be incorrect not only disallowing low brightness values but also losing precision (Incorrect range is effectively lower than 1-937).

tldr: Normal 1/937 much brighter than inverted 936/937. The latter being the original correct brightness produced by 1/937.

This however has a nasty side effect as that laptops that are docked have normally their lid closed. 

I already reported this to Lennart and his indication is that this should be fixed in the kernel (setting event SD_DOCK) or by the desktop environment. 

Unfortunately systemd starts already suspending the laptop during the boot process long before I reach the login manager. This means that practically I can no longer boot my laptop while it is docked without opening the lid. As that I have an external monitor this is a bit of a ridiculous situation. 

I already raised a bug for the kernel but I do not expect a fast reply on that nor a fix.  Raising a bug for the desktop environment (as suggested by Lennart) would be strange as that NO desktop environment is running at that time. The only process that is in full control at that moment is systemd (system boot time).",7,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-67461","Multiple selection of styles only works for Delete but not for Hide/Show","Styles - multiple selection and only Delete possible

I looked what is new in LibreOffice 4.1 Writer and noticed that multiple delete of style is possible. This feature was added according to bug report: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46718

Looking into the solution and I see this solution little bit strange (or bugy).

1. Format | Styles and Formatting.
2. Click on Page Style button (4th button) - this is just because Page Style has less styles listed so easier to demonstrate.
3. Right click somewhere in window and New....
4. In Organizer tab | Style | Name field type in test1 and click on OK button.
5. Repeat step 4 and name it test2.
6. In style list click on test1 press CTRL and hold and click on test2.
7. Right click and Delete. Result: both two styles are deleted. So new feature of deleting multiple styles works fine.
8. Repeat steps 4 5 6.
9. Right click and Hide.
10. (observe) You can see there is no more test1 it was hidden but test2 is still displayed. This is strange from design point of view. Now from bottom drop-down list select Hidden Styles and there is only test1 listed. This is prove that only first style marked was hidden. So Hide does not work for multiple selections.

P.S. The same problem for Modify (in step 9 select Modify).
P.S.S. The same problem for Show. Hiding test1 and test2 one by one. From drop-down selection Hidden Styles select both test1 and test2 and right click and Show and only first test1 style gets removed from Hidden Styles.

In my humble opinion this should be solved like this:
a) For Modify if multiple selection is done then right menu Modify option should be grayed out. You can't modify two styles at once so option not logical.
b) For Hide / Show - do the same as a) or implement solution to hide/show multiple styles.

the -z defs parameter (libtool's -no-undefined translates to this on some
architectures).

It seems that some OOo hackers have run into this problem:
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.ximian.openoffice/617

You should be able to reproduce this bug with the following steps:
  $ cat foo.c
  #include 

  GtkWidget *
  foo(void)
  {
      g_message(foo called)
      return gtk_button_new_with_label (foo)

  foo.o(.text+0x1b): In function `foo':

  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

The -no-undefined/-zdefs flag tells the linker that you're listing every library
that is directly used by the particular library you're linking.  The linker can
use this information to produce slightly better code since it knows which
library each symbol belongs to.

Some packages assumed that pkg-config would expand the library list for them
which was a valid assumption for all versions up to 0.15.


What was the rationale behind this change in behaviour?  From what I can tell
it will also cause problems for static linking since no existing packages know
that they'd need to use the pkg-config --static option in order to get a
complete list like they used to.",66,"0"

The interesting thing is that switching the group order fixed the problem:

"LIBREOFFICE-76203","UI: Missing title case in a few dialogs","(US) English Language UI Settings LO 4.2.1.1 Win 8.1

Problem Description:
In LO we are using for the main titles and headlines of the dialogs the title case (capitalise significant/longer words) instead of the sentence case (capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences: e.g. first word starting with capital letter and then going on with small letters).
I personally also would prefer that title case for the menus and dialogs of LO but only for the main titles and headlines.

Note: You can see the title case writing for instance if you take a look at menus in the menu VIEW.

But I found there some dialogs where there are items not in this title case systematics if we want to follow that (see list below).

Does anybody has any objections comments or corrections to my comment?

"FREEDESKTOP.ORG-66898","Creation of a new telepathy-qt-farstream repository","Hello

this is a formal request for the creation of a new repository in the telepathy group telepathy-qt-farstream.

Please note that this is not a new project but a split of the existing telepathy-qt. At the moment the main telepathy-qt repository includes TelepathyQt-Farstream in the same tree. This is less than optimal for several reasons and adds complexity for packagers and distributors. The change is also aligned to telepathy-glib vs. telepathy-farstream.

Following the creation of the new repository telepathy-qt will be split and telepathy-qt-farstream will follow its own development cycle. The maintainers of telepathy-qt-farstream will be the same maintainers of telepathy-qt.

The decision has been approved and discussed at Akademy 2013.",192,"1"
"XORG-38012","[Arrandale] HP 8440p locks solid on 2.6.39 with 2.14.0+.","On my HP 8440p the system locks solid when xorg starts.

This does not happen when running Ubuntu 10.10 with the 2.12.0 driver however it does with the 2.14.0 driver.

This does not happen with 2.6.38 but does with 2.6.39.

There are no logs on the system after the crash nothing gets written to the disk for either the kernel log or the Xorg log.

The git bisect log for this is below however I was unable to complete the bisect because my system will not boot inside the DRI branch which this was bisected to.

If necessary I may be able to work around this with an install on an external drive however that is time consuming enough that it would at best have to wait until next weekend.

"DBUS-101858","recent libexpat versions can make dbus-daemon hang waiting for entropy","@hewittc on GitHub reported a boot sequence issue on an ARM device running Arch Linux apparently triggered by a libexpat upgrade: with libexpat >= 2.2.1 system services like systemd-logind and systemd process 1 would frequently fail to connect to the dbus-daemon. This caused subsequent uses of systemd-logind (in particular system logins) to fail making the system rather broken.

Enabling verbose logging for the dbus-daemon indicated that the dbus-daemon starts 7.2 seconds after boot stops logging anything at 7.3 seconds then wakes up again and resumes logging things at 38.1 seconds. That's shortly after the kernel reports this:

[   37.789094] ngsa-2 kernel: random: nonblocking pool is initialized

which I think is the time at which getrandom() stops blocking. So I suspect that the dbus-daemon is blocking in libexpat for approximately 30 seconds while waiting for entropy. 30ish seconds is too long for the timeouts used in systemd systemd-logind and systemd-networkd - by the time the dbus-daemon has woken up those system services have already timed out.

The motivation for using high-quality entropy seems to be to avoid hash collision complexity attacks involving crafted XML files that collide. dbus-daemon does not actually need this: the only XML that we parse is completely trusted (it's the dbus-daemon's configuration). So this failure mode could be avoided by asking libexpat to not wait for high-quality entropy.

XML_SetHashSalt() with some arbitrary nonzero hash_salt parameter is an undocumented way to do this which a libexpat developer has confirmed should work. As a short term fix we can add a call to this. It might become a no-op one day but it can't hurt.

Longer term libexpat might gain a function like XML_UseWeakRandomness() or something which we could also call.",8,"0"

For example when I compare pdftops output-pdftopsbug.pdf (my test file for slanted text) I get sequences like the one below where the 1 array dup is from 0.18.4 and the  array dup is from a git clone from 4Mar12.
Since the 0.18.4 version works I think that the larger allocation is unnecessary and might cause problems by wasting memory in the postscript interpreter.

I verified via dmesg xrandr xorg logs & the LCD's own OSD that it was indeed using the native mode correctly.  I'm going to see if I can find a camera good enough to see the problem.

"WAYLAND-89235","Microsoft mouse not recognized on GNOME with Wayland","Description of problem:
The Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3.0 mouse isn't being recognized by GNOME on Wayland. The USB ID is 045e:009d. GNOME on Wayland works fine with other mouse+keyboard wireless bundles like the Logitech (Holtek) with the USB ID 04d9:a01c.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 
libinput-0.7.0.x86_64 (2.20141211git58abea394.fc21)
mutter-3.14.3.x86_64 (1.fc21)


How reproducible: Always at least on this system.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the said mouse connected.
2. Start the GNOME on Wayland session trough gdm.
3. Try to move the said mouse.

Actual results:
It will not move/click altough it recognizes keyboard input and mouse input from other vendors.

Expected results:
Out-of-the-box working mouse support for all USB HID-compliant mouses.

Additional info:
Additional GPU is also not being recognized (I will open another bug for this which is waaaaay more complex).",13,"0"

I've searched google and the xorg bugzilla extensively but not found anything
similar.

The vesa driver does appear to work on Fedora core 6 (with the same version of
X: 7.1.1) so perhaps this is an issue with Ubuntu's packaging or upgrade
procedure. Still I feel that X should give a meaningful error and abort rather
than hanging partway through.

Any suggestions about what to try would be much appreciated.",698,"1"

Screenshot

The game Heroes of Newerth is showing problems when texture compression (through libtxc_dxtn) is used: most of the menu becomes totally black.

Removing libtxc_dxtn.so or launching the game with MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE=-GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc -GL_S3_s3tc makes it work again. (Though the S2 Games logo that should be visible before the menu loads is still not there with S3TC disabled)

Neither llvmpipe or softpipe seems to be affected by this problem.

I have tried git from a few months back and the result is the same so I don't think this is a regression.

logicaly the key on the right of the '0' is a ''). The other is a key between
the left 'shit' and the 'Z' at the lower left of the keyboard.

made by Ricardo Y. Igarashi  you have that key labled 
that in the same lable for a key with a similar layout in the pc104 keyboard.
This rename operation makes the key in the english layout simply disapear. 

I made a few changes in my configuration that make it all ok. I configured the
layout as ABNT2 and multiple layouts (Br and US international). After I made the
following simple changes to /usr/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/br and

Backtrace from the core file

I was trying Dave Airlie's new DP MST patches (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/log/?h=drm-i915-mst-support) on my T440s with two monitors with different resolutions connected via an ultradock.  This segfault occurs always when I un-dock the laptop from the dock.  I guess this is relavant: while undocking the gnome-settings daemon tries to configure X to use just the laptop's display through xrandr and that is where the crash occurs.

Previously I tried 2.99.912 version which crashed upon changing the orientation of a connected monitor through xrandr.  This current git master (b3d3c0e8e75) does not have this problem.

I'm aware that the texture data contains whatever garbage malloc returns but the full program where I stumbled on this bug exhibit the same crash with valid ETC2 data so I don't think the actual image data is relevant.

GPU Hang results in visible Lag/short hang/ not updating of the Desktop-UI (KDE).

12:27  the UI can either ignore the signal or respect the signal by

Problem description: 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Download file attached and start macro 'filter'

OR

1. Open Calc and fill in cells A2:'1' A3:'libre'
2. Open Basic IDE insert and start the following macro:

Sub Filter
 Dim oFilterDef as Object        'Filterdescriptor
 Dim oFilterfield as Object      'Filterkriterium
 Dim oArea as Object             'Filterarea

  .StringValue = libre
 end with
  
 oArea = ThisComponent.Sheets.getbyIndex(0).getCellRangebyPosition(0 0 3 6)

Xorg.0.log

Forwarding this bug from a Ubuntu reporter:
https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/302227

[Problem]
On dual-head setup mouse cursor movement is restricted to a 800x600 window unless dragging outside this area redraw in compiz is affected as well.

[Discussion]
First shown with Compiz enabled on a two-screen netbook (Acer Aspire One external 1024x768 screen to the right of built-in LCD) setup. Anything past the leftmost 800x600 would not be erased after being drawn and external monitor resolution would be misdetected.

Upon disabling Compiz things are properly erased but after login the pointer is restricted to the leftmost 800x600 rectangle and I need to drag something outside the rectangle to be able to move the pointer freely.

Since the redraw vestiges happen only outside an 800x600 window (the same size the greeter used) it is possible that the background window (or however it may be called in Z/Compiz-speak) responsible for ensuring things get erased when needed is being sized at the same size the greeter used (800x600 in this case) instead of the size of the combined monitor area (2048x768).

- Can't drag mouse outside leftmost 800x600 region
- Can't drag icons outside leftmost 800x600 region
- Screenshots only grab the leftmost 800x600 rectangle (so I can't show most of what I am experiencing)
- Right-clicking icons in the top Gnome bar makes the pop-up menu appear in the leftmost position of the external monitor

One more comment: X/Compiz work fine on the LCD-only configuration. The 800x600 rectangle the cursor is confined to in the double-headed config is notable because it's the same resolution that the GDM takes (probably because it's the largest VESA-like mode both monitors can show).

I had the opportunity to hook up the laptop to a couple odd monitors (I have a collection of interesting computers and recently got a couple Intergraph behemoths with coax and DB-15 connections). All were misdetected and the same rendering and pointer confinement anomalies happened.

The problem is present in Jaunty. Using xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.6.3-0ubuntu9 and compiz 1:0.8.2-0ubuntu8 more or less the same dual-monitor oddness persists. The difference is the login screen is not squashed in the built-in widescreen display but is 800x600 on the secondary (still misdetected) monitor. Desktop background and mouse movement are still limited to the top-left 800x600 rectangle of the multi-head desktop until I drag the mouse. Windows are still not properly erased outside the top-left 800x600 region.

Oddly enough the problem vanished when I started the computer with the second monitor plugged in but turned off this morning and rearranged the dual-screen config with the screen applet. X still but started with mirrored screens at 800x600.

i965/miptree: Set logical_depth0 == 6 for cube maps

This matches what we do for cube maps where logical_depth0 is in number of
face-layers rather than number of cubes.  This does mean that we will
temporarily be setting the surface bounds too loose for cube map textures
but we are already setting them too loose for cube arrays and we will be
fixing that in the next commit anyway.

"WAYLAND-82742","Touch doesn't work after calibration","Environment:
Embedded Linux Device
Resistive Touch Screen
Latest Weston/Wayland and Libinput

Summary:

Calibrated values are based on pixels and are used to compensate for differences in touch screens.

Libinput receives raw touch values. On an resistive touchscreen these are based on ADC values with a range (ex 0 - 4095). Libinput then uses the calibrated values to adjust the raw touch values. These adjusted values are then passed to Weston which eventually converts the adjusted values to actually screen coordinates/pixels. However when calculating the screen coordinates these adjusted values results in very large values (greater the screen dimension) or negative values to be returned. When Weston sends these coordinates values to the rest of the system no interaction with views can take place since the incorrect touch coordinates are beyond the screen thus no interaction can ever take place.

So before any raw values are adjusted via calibration they should first be converted to screen coordinates / pixels. This is how Weston without libinput handles things and touch works fine.

Compare the PDF files of the same ODT file using DiffPDF on Debian Linux

Problem description: A PDF file is exported. An extra dot is added to a line in the Table of Contents in the PDF file exported by LibreOffice 4.0.0.0 Beta1.

Steps to reproduce:
1. The operating system used is Linux debian 2.6.32-5-686 #1 SMP Sun Sep 23 09:49:36 UTC 2012 i686 GNU/Linux.
2. The OpenDocument Text (ODT) file can be found here:

3. LibreOffice 3.6.3-> File-> Open-> (the file mentioned above)-> File-> Export as PDF (PDF/A-1a) 
4. LibreOffice 4.0.0.0 Beta1-> File-> Open-> (the file mentioned above)-> File-> Export as PDF (PDF/A-1a) 
5. Compare and contrast the two PDF files of the same ODT file. See the lines:

However the FS is really simple and the VS is pretty large.  I managed to cut roughly 50% of the VS instructions and that roughly doubled the performance.  So clearly the VS is important.

Using performance monitoring it looks like the VS actually takes up ~70% of the time.  So shader_time is just full of lies.  It appears that it's undercounting the VS time in Unigine Valley as well.

I believe the timestamp register is getting reset in almost every VS so we just count 0 most of the time.

Proposal for bugfix applies against master branch 064445364b4775b25ba49c2250b22b169f291147

Hello

on my machine and touchpad (supports 3 touches) the Linux kernel may send multiple touch state updates per SYN_REPORT event for the same slot.
I'm not much into Kernel code but reading the documentation to the evdev module there's nowhere written this must not happen so the synaptics driver should deal with it. Anyways it doesn't and it had my XServer reliably crash after ~3h of usage for the past two weeks on my new Laptop :(
Behaviour reproduced on a 3.16.0-0.bpo.4-amd64 kernel as well as most recent 3.18.5 on a vanilla debian xorg-xserver xf86-input-synaptics as well as on the latest git versions.

Here's the event sequence that triggers it (some standard events like abs position events partially omitted):

OPEN SLOT 0
ABS X
ABS Y
[...]
SYN_REPORT
OPEN SLOT 1
ABS [...]

SYN_REPORT

CLOSE SLOT 0
OPEN SLOT 0          <----- here bad things will happen
ABS [...]
SYN_REPORT

The function EventProcessTouchEvent() in eventcomm.c:600 (just overwrites the SLOTSTATE_CLOSE value so that HandleTouches in synaptics.c never gets notified by the close.

Attached patch is a proposal to get rid of this unpleasant matter.
Will inject SYN_REPORT behaviour if a slotstate would be overwritten and holds back the touch event until synaptics.c has been properly notified.

Best regards

"LIBREOFFICE-58251","BUGZILLAASSISTANT: Inappropriate regression keyword","It seems that the BSA adds the regression key word automatically if there is a Latest known-working version selected before the Version.

This often is correct but sometimes of course the bug is related to a new feature for this kind of bugs I believe it's common sense that we do not set the regression Keyword.

Although the number of bugs with inappropriate regression might be not too big the problem is annoying because this keyword means some kind of alarm for many of us. So I wold prefer a solutions that adds a text to the comment as a reminder for QA staff (Possibly regression?).

I recommend to wait for some comments and then to decide whether we leave this BSA feature as it is or do a modification?

The spec as currently written doesn't allow to control the initial direction in any of these cases.  suggest the following:

1. Allow calling of SetSending()/RequestReceiving() on initial streams before the Accept() call to set the direction in the initial offer and answer.

2. On streams added after the call is started set the LocalSendingState to PENING_SEND if the other side creates a stream asking us to send.

3. For Contents created with AddContent() it's a bit touchy.. ie I have no idea how to do it with the current API short of adding another argument to AddContent() or adding a Accept() to the Content itself all of which is a bit nasty.

"WAYLAND-76760","libinput sometimes registers unwanted right-clicks on touchpads","Created attachment 96567
evemu recording illustrating the unintended right-click

Currently libinput applies the logic that a two-finger tap means a right-click. Let's view this in more detail. There are in fact two kinds of two-finger taps.

Kind A:

Finger 0 placed.
Finger 1 placed.
Finger 1 removed.
Finger 0 removed.

Kind B:

Finger 0 placed.
Finger 1 placed.
Finger 0 removed.
Finger 1 removed.

Currently both kinds of the event sequences are registered as two-finger taps if the time period with both fingers present is short enough. Note that the last event does not matter for either kind as it happens after libinput has already registered the tap. I would argue that it is the wrong thing to do on the following grounds.

People have two use cases for two-finger taps.

Use case A:

Initially no fingers are on the touchpad. A user already has the pointer positioned correctly and wants to right-click just where it is. So one just taps with two fingers. The whole sequence of events is short and sometimes it ends up as Kind A sometimes as Kind B.

Use case B:

A user already has a finger on the touchpad positioning the cursor. It takes some time. Then he/she wants to right-click. So the user places and quickly removes the second finger. Result: event sequence of Kind A with a relatively long time (and quite possibly some movements) between the first and the second event.

And now consider use case C where a right-click is not wanted:

A user is currently positioning the cursor with the intention to left-click using a hardware clickpad button and move the cursor no further. The actions of removing the finger that moved the cursor and pressing the button with the other finger happen concurrently. Result: sometimes a sequence of events where two fingers are never on the touchpad simultaneously sometimes a sequence of Kind B with a relatively long time (and quite possibly some movements) between the first and the second event.

The bug is that use case C is sometimes registered as a sequnce of a right-click and a left-click instead of only the left-click. The attached recording illustrates the problem at its end.

Proposal: if a finger has been on the touchpad for a sufficiently long time or has moved a long distance make its removal ineligible for registering the two-finger tap.",95,"0"

        drm/i915: Prevent recursion by retiring requests when the ring is full

    Ville raised the point that our interaction with request->tail was
    likely to foul up other uses elsewhere (such as hang check comparing
    ACTHD against requests).

    However we also need to restore the implicit retire requests that certain
    test cases depend upon (e.g. igt/gem_exec_lut_handle) this raises the
    spectre that the ppgtt will randomly call i915_gpu_idle() and recurse
    back into intel_ring_begin().

    Media force wake get hangs the machine when the system is booted without

    the firmware has skipped some initialization in that case.

    Empirical evidence suggests we need to reset the media force wake

"PULSEAUDIO-93946","Changing device profile to HDMI is reset to default after monitor goes into powersave","I have an arch linux system with an up to date plasma desktop (plasma-framework 5.18.0-3 (kf5) and plasma-desktop 5.5.4-1 (plasma) and running pulseaudio for sound.

After recent package updates to:

[2016-01-23 10:56] [ALPM] upgraded libpulse (7.1-3 -> 8.0-1)
[2016-01-23 10:56] [ALPM] upgraded pulseaudio (7.1-3 -> 8.0-1)
[2016-01-23 10:56] [ALPM] upgraded pulseaudio-gconf (7.1-3 -> 8.0-1)

I found that my usual sound setting to have sound output going to the HDMI output to my monitor speakers had been changed to analogue.  

From the plasma K menu I have to go to System Settings -> Multimedia then Audio and Video tab - choose Audio Hardware Setup tab - and then select the sound card profile as Digital Stereo (HDMI 2) Output and Analog Stereo Input and click Apply.  If I then run pactl list sinks in a terminal I get output which has the tail end as:

                device.form_factor = internal
                device.string = hdmi:01
                device.buffering.buffer_size = 352800
                device.buffering.fragment_size = 176400
                device.access_mode = mmap+timer
                device.profile.name = hdmi-stereo-extra1
                device.profile.description = Digital Stereo (HDMI 2)
                device.description = Built-in Audio Digital Stereo (HDMI 2)
                alsa.mixer_name = Intel PantherPoint HDMI

        Active Port: hdmi-output-1
        Formats:
                pcm

Then sound through the HDMI connection to the speakers on the monitor works fine but only for some limited period. 

After some period of time leaving the system not using any sound output the sound stops working again and the command pactl list sinks in a terminal then shows:

device.product.name = 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller

                device.access_mode = mmap+timer
                device.profile.name = analog-stereo
                device.profile.description = Analog Stereo
                device.description = Built-in Audio Analog Stereo

        Formats:
                pcm

If I then go back to the System Settings and look again at Multimedia then Audio and Video tab - choose Audio Hardware Setup tab my settings have reverted back to Analogue Stereo Output.

So it seems that pulseaudio has some kind of timeout for the changed setting and it does not remain permanent despite changing it and applying it in the plasma settings area.  I have also tried changing the setting by right clicking the volume icon in the system tray which then leads to the same GUI and options. But this has the same result.

"XORG-3603","[BROKEN BUG] XcursorScanTheme does not handle circular icon theme inheritence.","If your icon themes have circular inheritance XcursorScanTheme recurses  
infinitely (until it eventually stack-overflows).   
    
We noticed this bug because the KDE mouse control panel dies when you try to  
launch it (if you have circular icon theme inheritence) -- the rest of KDE  
works fine.   
   
I hacked up a little patch that checks for circular Inherits. A quick overview  
of my patch:   
   
 ~ renamed XcursorScanTheme to XcursorScanThemeAccum and added a third  
parameter seen which is a list of all the themes that have already been  
checked.   
   
 ~ Added a new XcursorScanTheme that is a wrapper around XcursorScanThemeAccum  
so that the existing calls to XcursorScanTheme do not have to be changed. (To  
keep the patch simple).   
   
 ~ Only recursively call XcursorScanThemeAccum if the inherited theme has not  
already been checked.   
   
 ~ Note that I prepend new themes to the list rather than append them because  
it flows naturally with the recursion that way.   
  
This is the patch that we use internally I am sure a few changes would be  
needed if it was applied to the official source. Please feel free to email if 
you have questions or flames.

"XORG-27798","empty name for a user-specified panel mode","Created attachment 35241
Correctly set the name for the user-specifier panel mode.

On a Hercules eCafé 800 laptop that uses a AMD Geode LX graphic chip and a 800x480 TFT panel I have to use the PanelMode option to specify the correct mode for the panel (or else it uses a 800x600 mode and the TFT panel only shows the top 480 lines).

But when this option is used the mode is created as expected but with an empty name which is somewhat confusing.

The attached patch (trivial) solves this problem.

Note: I experienced this problem with Ubuntu 9.10 with Xorg 7.4 and Geode driver 2.11.6 but I believe the problem still exists in git HEAD of the Geode driver (looking at the code).",17,"0"

 For example GTK's autogen.sh can be run from a separate directory where all

Cairo's configury should also support this form of operation.  It means that
build files don't clutter up the source directory so e.g. grep doesn't search
through .o files.  Also it means you can clear out the build files simply by
just rm -rf builddir.  JHBuild assumes this mode of operation by default.",87,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-55156","Hang on accessing any pane in the application Options dialog when Cinch is running (related to Mac OS accessibility)","When Cinch a popular window management utility for Mac OS X is installed and running any attempt to access any pane of the application Options dialog leads to a hang. (See “steps to reproduce” below for details!)

This is very probably yet another bug in the LibreOffice code related to Mac OS X accessibility features because
 * Cinch relies heavily on these accessibility features (it requires the system
   preference “Universal Access > Enable access for assistive devices”
   to be checked) and
 * the log file created by Mac OS X when I forced quit LibreOffice because of
   the hang contains many references to accessibility stuff.

NB: I create a new bug report for this issue because no one of the existing bug reports about problems accessing panes of the application Options dialog covers this special issue clearly.


Steps to reproduce:
-------------------
1) Download Cinch available from
       http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/index.html
   (ShareWare but you can try it for free just as I did).
2) Start it just like a normal application.
   -> During startup Cinch will automatically enable
   the system preference “Enable access for assistive devices”
   (in “System Preferences > Universal Access”) for you.
3) Optional: Rename your LibreOffice user profile folder
   to preclude any influence of local settings on the test results.
4) Start LibreOffice.
   -> The Start Center window appears.
5) Select “LibreOffice > Preferences...” from the menu bar.
   -> the dialog window “Options” appears
   it shows by default the first pane: “LibreOffice > User data”.
6) Now try to select any other pane from the list at the left
   e.g. “General”.
   -> First nothing happens
   then the spinning cursor appears
   LibreOffice hangs.
   [In the case that you *can* select another pane (I have seen this once)
   just try to repeat this i.e. select yet another pane
   now LibreOffice hangs.]

Attached to this bug report you will find the log file created by Mac OS X when I forced quit LibreOffice because of this hang.


Reproducible with:
..................
* LibreOffice 3.3.0 (OOO330m19 Build:6 tag libreoffice-3.3.0.4)
* LibreOffice 3.5.6.2 (Build ID: e0fbe70-dcba98b-297ab39-994e618-0f858f0)
* LibreOffice 3.6.2.1 (Build ID: ba822cc)
* LOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0+ Build ID: 01e6335 Pull time: 2012-09-18 04:23:03
* and probably every other LibreOffice version.

"XORG-6613","evdev hijacks the /dev/input/eventX device","Hi! 

I've been using X.org 6.8 with evdev mouse driver (hacked into X.org by gentoo)
for a while along with the evrouter program to manage extra buttons on my MS
Wireless Explorer mouse. This program monitors /dev/input/event_usb
(udev-created link to this mouse's evdev interface) and does specified actions
(simulates key presses) when extra mouse buttons are pressed.

All this worked fined until I installed X.org 7.0.

When I run X the mouse works fine but evrouter no longer works. Apparently X
somehow gets exclusive access to /dev/input/event_usb because even cat
/dev/input/event_usb produces absolutely no output when I move my mouse / press
any buttons on it. So evrouter doesn't read any mouse events from
/dev/input/event_usb.

This only pertains to the evdev mouse driver my trackpoint (handled by regular
mouse driver) produces output when I cat /dev/input/event_trackpoint.

relevant portion of xorg.conf:

Section InputDevice
        Identifier  usbmouse

And I run mesa on Tizen4.0 RPI3 but this bug is not related with platform.

The reason is  in struct gl_array_attributes the type of member Size is GLubyte and member Stride is short but in get_hash_params.py things are different there are sentences like  ARRAY_INT(VertexAttrib[VERT_ATTRIB_POS].Size)) ARRAY_INT(VertexAttrib[VERT_ATTRIB_POS].Stride) so in function _mesa_GetIntegerv() the type is wrong the size will be wrong by wrong explicit conversion.

"PULSEAUDIO-90489","[regression] DYNAMIC_LATENCY introduced in module-combine causes a race contition between pa_sink_render_into_full and sink_update_requested_latency_cb in alsa-sink.c","When sink_update_requested_latency() in src/modules/module-combine-sink.c:790 is called it posts a SINK_INPUT_MESSAGE_SET_REQUESTED_LATENCY message to all of it's output sinks. If one of the sinks is created by module-alsa-sink sink_update_requested_latency_cb() in src/alsa/alsa-sink.c:1507 is called to handle the latency change. This function except updating the latency sometimes also creates a rewind request. 

If the rewind request gets processed before the pa_sink_render_into_full() is called everything will work as supposed. However if not the !s->thread_info.rewind_requested assertion is being triggered on src/pulsecore/sink.c:1323 causing whole server to abort.

Fix the build with automake 1.13

In Automake 1.13 the long-deprecated macro AM_CONFIG_HEADER (deprecated since 2002) has been removed in favour of AC_CONFIG_HEADERS.

Attached patch fix this problem by using the new macro.

possibly useful notes :
- this is NOT a wine bug. game works with wine when using fglrx (but the display is a mess - that's a fglrx problem). whole system usually runs without fglrx.
- mesa works properly with native linux software - tested mostly with darkplaces with various detail levels and with doom3.
- i have composite and aiglx disabled in xorg.conf
- all git components are checked out off master branches every two days.

A calc sheet reproducing the matrix computation issue

Problem description: 
When recomputing matrix values computed by a libreoffice-basic function which returns an array CALC shows erratic errors 522 even though there are no circular references in the spreadsheet and the called BASIC function works perfectly fine under the debugger.

How to reproduce the issue:
- Open the attached Calc document. This document contains zero macro and 1 BASIC function (named LOESS1) implementing a Local regression fitting (a.k.a. LOESS) algorithm (which has been successfully tested elsewhere). This function returns an array of Double and is called in the formula of a cell matrix (located in column C)
- Say yes to the activate macros question. The document gets open with no error in column C.
- Type a different number value in B3 (e.g. 76.8). The column C gets recomputed ending up with cells containing Err:522.

Note that if you save the Calc document with that cell change then close it and reopen it the column C gets recomputed with no Err:522... until you change again a cell from column B.

Expected result:
No cell of the matrix should contain Err:522 as there are no circular reference in the recomputed cell formulas and the called function does not generate any computation error.",62,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-73165","inline spellchecking waits for typing pauses before redlining errors","Hello

I have been using LibreOffice for years on Linux. I have recently noticed that spellchecking has become terribly slow. I am using Libreoffice 4.1.4.2 on Arch Linux on a fast Intel Core I5 laptop and I've never seen spellchecking this slow. It usually takes at least 1 second after hitting the spacebar after a misspelled word before it shows up with a red underline. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds or more. By this time I have usually typed far beyond that word and don't notice it anymore. This slowness occurs with both English and Spanish spellchecking and I imagine the other languages are the same. I can also confirm that on Firefox the built in spellchecking (which I believe uses the same engine?) is instantaneous and reliable. I can't really say when exactly this regression happened but a few months ago I don't think it was this bad on whatever the current LibO version was at that time.

"LIBREOFFICE-33842","Impress does not save new background image","Hello everyone. 

I 'd like to report a bug I came across using LibreOffice Impress. I am using version 3.3.0 RC4 (which I think is the same as the official release). 

The problem is as follows: I created a new presentation in Impress. I chose a background for a particular slide saved it. When I re-opened the application I wanted to go with a different background chose the new one saved it. When I re-open the presentation still has the first image as a background for that slide (it should display the new one). 

Here is a breakdown of the procedure:

1) Open Impress create a new presentation.
2) Choose a neutral background for all slides
3) Make a couple of slides
4) Choose a background image for a particular slide X (let's call this PictureA.jpg)
5) Save quit reopen presentation.
6) Choose a different background image for slide X (this will be called PictureB.jpg) (Choose NO when questioned about all slides both times)
7) Save quit reopen presentation.
8) Impress still has PictureA.jpg as the background for slide X whereas it should have used PictureB.jpg

I have reproduced this problem using this sequence for at least 2 different slides. 

As a workaround I have to delete the slide that uses PictureA.jpg as a background and recreate it choosing PictureB.jpg from the beginning. Not too much of a hassle but it is annoying if the slide to be deleted has a lot of stuff in it. 

Let me know if you need additional info.

Having drawn a line on a slide and selecting that line but releasing the left button one gets a line with two light blue squares at the ends. When hoovering the mouse on the line the mouse pointer changes into a hand. Pressing down the left button holding it down one can move the line around. However sometimes when pressing the left mouse button the mouse pointer changes in a gray square. After releasing the button LibreOffice crashes. I have the impression that this happens when the mouse pointer is a little bit off the line. It is reproducible within a few minutes.

Currently the attached odp file makes it reproducible. Select the lowest line in slide 4 so the light blue squares appear move the mouse pointer over the line so the hand appears and press the left button. Now the gray square appears and after the release of the button the crash is there.
One can prevent the crash by moving the mouse pointer to an area where it changes in the black circle with the slash in it and release the button.",355,"1"

Pls see original report

I found that with LibreOffice 3.4.0RC1  – WIN7  Home Premium  (64bit) English UI [OOO340m1 (Build:11)]

Steps to reproduce: 
1. open attached sample.ods
2. Click A21
3. Click Fill handle and drag / drop it until cells ...A25 will be filled. 
   So you should have done the Fill > Series function and new contents of cells 
   should be numbers 21 ... 24 in A21:A25
4. click undo button before nest test
   All new contents should disappear
5. Use Filter: Click Auto Filter arrow in column E with ehading e
6. Filter empty
   Nothing should happen all cells are empty in this column
8. redo from step 2 ... step 4
   Expected: same result numbers 21 ... 24 in A22:A25
   Actual: All new cell contents is 20

I also tested with OOo 3.1.1 there fill handle works as expected also with active filter.

I only see that problem having used Auto Filter. Doing the same filtering with Standard Filter does not show the broken fill series effect.

I believe this is a regression I believe I would have remarked if that would had happened in stable LibO versions.

"PULSEAUDIO-62588","It should be possible to enable remixing only between mono and non-mono","Currently if remixing is disabled in daemon.conf (enable-remixing=no) playing a mono stream to a stereo sink results in silence. There should be a possibility to enable remixing only when adapting audio between mono and non-mono.

The suggested solution is to add mono-only as a possible value for the enable-remixing option (currently only yes and no are supported).

I already made a patch that changes the behavior of the no option so that remixing between mono and non-mono would still be enabled but that approach got opposition: no should mean no not no except sometimes yes.

My patch is probably a useful starting point anyway so here's a link to it: https://gitorious.org/~tanuk/pulseaudio/tanuk-clone/commit/97906429424dbd8a047b5e34dc3568bc6cbdb508",1389,"1"

I'm currently using Fedora RawhideI also compile D.R.M and Nouveau from git as w well.I have posted the error message on the Fedora Rawhide forumthinking it might've been their freeGLUT packages not working properlyI have tried to re-install them via yumbut that has no effect.

"SYSTEMD-82347","RFE: honour gpio input device shutdown keypresses","There are a couple of ARM-based server systems that use the gpio-keyboard and gpio-keyboard-polled drivers to send an event requesting a shutdown. The following rules DTRT though obviously it'd be nice if a more generic (but still safe) rule could be devised.

SUBSYSTEM==input KERNEL==event* SUBSYSTEMS==platform KERNELS==gpio-keys.6 PROGRAM=/bin/grep '^HP ProLiant m400 Server Cartridge$' /proc/device-tree/model TAG+=power-switch


SUBSYSTEM==input KERNEL==event* SUBSYSTEMS==platform KERNELS==gpio_keys.12 ATTRS{keys}==116 PROGRAM=/bin/cat /proc/device-tree/model RESULT==HP ProLiant m800 Server Cartridge TAG+=power-switch

You'll notice a couple of differences between the two. The m800 rule specifies a key attribute where the m400 rule does not. This is because the first uses a polled gpio via the gpio-keyboard-polled driver. This driver does not expose a keys attribute in sysfs. The m400 uses the gpio-keyboard driver which does.

You'll also notice the grep vs. cat/RESULT methods. Not sure if upstream has a preference.

It might make sense to drop the model/pin matching of the m800 rule and bind to any ATTR{keys}==116 - this is defined as KEY_POWER in . Of course that won't help the -polled variant.",542,"1"

I have a docking station and am trying to connect a Dell P2415Q monitor to it through DP. Using xrandr or arandr I can see that the monitor is successfully detected but when I enable it although it says that the monitor is enabled I don't see any output on the screen and I get the following in dmesg:

[drm:intel_cpu_fifo_underrun_irq_handler [i915]] *ERROR* CPU pipe C FIFO underrun
When I enable MST on the monitor however it seems to work. But using MST this monitor cannot run at 60hz.
Any clues on what the issue could be ?",282,"1"

"DRI-91438","hard lockup after switching between laptop's panel and external monitor","Created attachment 117314
relevant dmesg and laptop info

When docking my laptop I usually use xrandr to turn off the laptop's display so that my taskbar and network applets are displayed properly on my external monitor.
When trying to debug some unrelated stuff I found out that I could hard lock the laptop after switching back and forth a few times between both monitors.

It took quite a bit of time to reproduce the problem. It happens only when the laptop is docked.

How to reproduce:
- laptop docked external monitor on VGA port (no dongle)
- the following steps trigger a hard lockup:

# try1
xrandr --output $PANEL --off
xrandr --output $EXT --auto
xrandr --output $PANEL --auto
xrandr --output $EXT --off

# try2
xrandr --output $PANEL --off
xrandr --output $EXT --auto # the external panel stays blank
xrandr --output $PANEL --auto # locks a bit after here
xrandr --output $EXT --off

note that the blocks are identical - ie there's no problem the first time but running the same commands a second time trigger the lockup. Both displays are black/blank so there's no way to even see what's happening.

The xrandrvga script in the attached tgz outputs dmesg + xrandr --verbose after each switch. The debug files show that the output of xrandr --verbose after setting the panel to auto in the 2nd try is 0. So I'm not sure if it's because of running xrandr or because the next command (turning off the external panel) triggers the hard lockup and the output file is not flushed to disk.

note:
- when docked the external monitor shows up as DP2-3 and it's DP2 when undocked (= plugged in the laptop's VGA port).
- enable_psr=0 enable_fbc=0

    Since modifierKeyMap is generated from modifierMap just remove it and
    only generate it when we need to send the modifier map to the client.

Author: Iago Toral Quiroga

    mesa: Fix incorrect assertion in init_teximage_fields_ms
    
    _BaseFormat is a GLenum (unsigned int) so testing if its value is
    greater than 0 to detect the cases where _mesa_base_tex_format
    returns -1 doesn't work.
    
    Fixing the assertion breaks the arb_texture_view-lifetime-format
    piglit test on nouveau since that test calls
    _mesa_base_tex_format with GL_R16F with a context that does not
    have ARB_texture_float so it returns -1 for the BaseFormat which
    was not being caught properly by the ASSERT in init_teximage_fields_ms
    until now.

Reverting the patch on Mesa 10.5.9 fixes the issue for me.

"XORG-3904","Problems with Xinerama: Trident 975Im�ge (PCI) and SiS520 (AGP)","Hi

I am running X11R6-6.8.1 in a 598MLR motherboard with on-board AGP video
(SiS520) i put one Trident 975Imàge in PCI slot and try to use Xinerama.
But a few things happens:

1. In first time all got ok only a little flickering in screen.
2. If i Ctrl+Alt+BS and start X again the SiS video works OK but the
   Trident video looses the correct frequency and i lose the image (sometimes
   the screen goes to 800x600 instead 1280x1024).
3. If i Crtl+Alt+BS again and start X again both screens loose their video.
   Ctrl+Alt+BS don't works (ok it works but i don't got console back!).

This things all happens in 16bit mode. In 24bit mode the Trident screen
got very confused and flickering. I try many times only one time i got an
real error message talking about vm86 error on trident module.

If i put the primarly display on PCI and second on AGP the system goes to
3. in the first time. If i disable vesa framebuffer the things are more
stable but the 1. flickering continues.",573,"1"

Patch to add a regression test to piglit

The EXT_packed_float extension defines a glGet* query GL_RGBA_SIGNED_COMPONENTS_EXT. However querying it in Mesa generates GL_INVALID_ENUM and a search of the codebase seems to indicate that it is not implemented.

I'm using Mesa 10.0.1 which is not yet a valid Version in the bug-tracker.

I'll attach a patch to piglit to add a test for this. Let me know if you'd like me to do anything about getting it pushed into the piglit code base.",1594,"1"

Using recent nouveau versions I’m encountering missing graphics in various programs (e.g. gtk’s filechooser LibreOffice Iceape Pidgin xfce4-panel’s pager and on lightdm’s gtk-greeter).

"XORG-77000","[Regression][Bisected] Touchpad gets stuck thinking there's two fingers present","Created attachment 96843
Sample log with error

Recently I've noticed that the multitouch on my touchpad is extremely unreliable. Most times after booting my system and loading X11 using more then one finger with the touchpad causes it to get stuck thinking there is more then one finger on the touchpad at all times even after lifting both fingers and only using one on the touchpad. This makes the touchpad pretty much unusable and the only thing that seems to fix it is switching to another VT and then switching back but then if I try to use more then one finger it gets stuck with the exact same issue until I switch VTs again. Occasionally if I restart X11 enough times I'll get lucky and get a single instance where the bug doesn't seem to come up and I can use the computer normally but then occasionally locking gnome or putting the laptop in standby and taking it out again will cause the bug to reemerge then I have to keep restarting X11 until I get lucky again.
I've finally got the chance to investigate the bug more (it's been happening for quite some time) and have bisected it and figured out what commit caused the bug. The first bad commit appears to be 2e5c0cf4395a0cf7b024495deab75f4ebe949e9a: eventcomm: drop mtdev.
I've attached some logs where Xorg actually reports that something's gone wrong with touchpad but it seems unfortunately I didn't have any debugging symbols present. The bug doesn't always show in the logs though so I'll compile in the debugging symbols and add better logs if it comes up again.
I'm currently running a ThinkPad Helix on Gentoo Linux with kernel version 3.12.13. I'm using the latest synaptics driver available from the git repo and running xorg-server version 1.15.",1,"0"

Enabling Option RandR12 in xorg.conf results in black screen. Server starts up fine seems to be usable only screen stays black. Monitor doesn't turn off.

VT switching works albeit with picture degradation (bad resolution?) which isn't recovered even when killing X (also crash on killing X with or without RandR12 see messages).

commit 7aedbbacae6d3ec3d06735fff2eb662964773ad2
Author: Marek Olšák 
Date:   Sat Feb 6 22:09:45 2016 +0100

    radeonsi: put image fmask and sampler descriptors into one array
    
    The texture slot is expanded to 16 dwords containing 2 descriptors.
    Those can be:
    - Image and fmask or
    - Image and sampler state
    
    By carefully choosing the locations we can put all three into one slot
    with the fmask and sampler state being mutually exclusive.
    
    This improves shaders in 2 ways:
    - 2 user SGPRs are unused shaders can use them as temporary registers now
    - each pair of descriptors is always on the same cache line
    
    v2: cosmetic changes: add back v8i32 don't load a sampler state & fmask
        at the same time",0,"0"

Background: We have a mail-merge module which uses the python mail API that we bundle. The code lives in scripting/source/pyprov/ and (of course) can be edited and tweaked at run time. Unfortunately we have a steady flow of bugs from this code - which are primarily around error reporting: if people enter bad server information or wrong port numbers or have any number of problems - the error reporting is terrible. Thus we get lots of reports of the form it doesn't work. We really need better diagnostic and preferably GUI feedback from the delivery code to help here.

"XORG-14935","How to get 1200x800 on Intel 965GM with Xorg on Sony Vaio?","Created attachment 15001
Xorg log file

Hello

  I did recently purchase a Sony Vaio VGN-NR160Q with an Intel 965GM video card and I can not yet make Xorg work on full screen - it starts on 1024x768 instead of 1200x800. Does someone have an idea how I can use the entire screen?

  What did I try:
  - Use 915resolution
  - Switch to 16bpp as xorg does not support 32bpp.
  - Tried intel and i810 drivers look to be the same.
  - I also have intelfb and i810fb drivers loaded in the kernel for the framebuffer. They should not affect anything I believe.

  I attach the xorg.conf 915resolution detected modes and Xorg.0.log files. Below are few lines of interest:

  Any help appreciated
  Thanks

For example on a fragment shader like this:

uniform sampler2D maintex
uniform float factor
varying vec2 uv
void main()
{
    vec4 c = texture2D (maintex uv)
    vec2 coord = c.xy

It does try to merge both coord.x and coord.y assignments into one even if they are under different branch conditions. Effectively it ends up with if (cond) coord.xy += ... which is wrong.

Real-life shaders like FXAA3.11 have a code very similar to the above and it regresses under this optimization.

"XORG-12865","[965] intermittent display corruption with framebuffer compression","Every now and then on my 965GM machine (a T61) I see a weird rendering problem that seems composite hook related.

The failure mode is one of two things:
  - all the stuff that's drawn using the render extension is missing from the screen (i.e. no fonts no icons)
  - all the stuff that's drawn using render is just shown as colored rectangles (same color for each rectangle different sizes for each font glyph)

I usually see this when I have framebuffer compression enabled but I'm also seeing it sometimes with the DRM base suspend/resume patch even when FBC is disabled.

It may be due to the fence registers not being setup correctly or a some bug in the composite hook itself... any ideas?

"CAIRO-48395","[nvidia-295] Slow bitmap font rendering with cairo-1.12.0","Bitmap font rendering in gtk applications is slow with Cairo 1.12.0-1 and 2. For example gvim and Dina (font) leads to slow build-up of the screen compared to qvim (qt) or gvim with a ttf font. The same problem also occurs for xfce-terminal but not in urxvt. In htop it shows that xorg goes to high cpu load when making changes on the screen. With cairo-xcb 1.10.2 from AUR (arch user repositories) this problem does not occur. 

Steps to reproduce:
Opening gvim with a bitmap font like Dina shows a slow buildup of the screen. Also making changes like toggling NERDtree or adding or removing menu toolbars are slow. It is also visible when switching to a desktop with gvim open. The problem is more obvious when the app window is larger.

I added in my xorg.conf the DontVtSwitch but appears don't work.

"EXEMPI-58175","exempi hardcodes Mac OS X header location","In configure.ac line 175 exempi adds the system header location to the CPPFLAGS with a hardcoded path of /Developer.

/Developer was the default path in older versions of Xcode however as of Xcode 4.3 the path has been moved inside the Xcode.app bundle which by default is installed in /Applications. You can use the OS's xcodebuild utility to determine the correct SDK path.

So the right lookup would be:

a) If /Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon exists use that
b) If not then xcodebuild can be shelled out to in order to determine the SDK path e.g.: `xcodebuild -version -sdk macosx10.7 Path`/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon

(You can determine the OS name via `sw_vers -productVersion` and shorten that to just the major OS version.)

I don't have a Snow Leopard machine in front of me but you may be able to use xcodebuild to find the path on older versions of Xcode as well.",39,"0"

- ctrl+c
- ctrl-v (the copied object becomes selected)
- check position and size (both position coordinates are at 0.01 offset)

If you do the same with a business letter the change of the name to the new sender works.

"DRI-96659","[DP] [BDW] dp to VGA dongle works intermittently","I'm trying to get a reliable mini-dp to VGA connection for a dell XPS 13 (9343 Broadwell) to a projector in a lecture theatre. I have a couple of dongles - one Apple mini dp-VGA and one cheap mini dp to VGA/HDMI/DVI combo.

Either works if I just connect to a monitor over a short cable.

In the lecture theatre the Apple dongle doesn't work at all and the cheap combo adapter works sometimes perhaps 1 in 3 times I plug it in.

In windows the Apple dongle works fine.

I have tried setting drm_kms_helper.dp_aux_i2c_transfer_size to 1 and 4 (which solved some problems with the apple adapter on ealier kernels) but this doesn't seem to make a difference now.

"XORG-93777","edid-decode spurious warning about string termination","EDID 1.3 states that if a Monitor Name descriptor (FCh) string is < 13 bytes then it should be terminated with ASCII 0Ah and padded with ASCII 20h.

If such a string is exactly 13 bytes then such termination and padding is obviously impossible.

However edid-decode will issue the following warning if the string is exactly 13 bytes:

Name descriptor not terminated with a newline

My feeling is that this warning is spurious because termination is only required if the string is < 13 bytes and the spec does not forbid 13-byte strings.",936,"1"

The monitor will go into stanby after startx (sometimes after a few seconds it will come out but display is still blank). X is still alive and working and I can switch VTs/ and get back to console OK.

    Workaround to make initial rotation work
    
    Acceleration needs to be initialized before setting the mode
    for initial rotation to work.  Changing the order in RADEONScreenInit()
    doesn't work because RADEONDRIKernelInit() hangs in the ioctl to
    initialize the CP if the mode is not set prior (even if the heads
    are turned off after setting the mode).  The workaround is to set the
    modes twice once before accel and once after.
    
    This needs to be looked into further.

"DBUS-23633","add regression test for using a non-default mainloop context","Dbus-Glib has a bug where it doesn't process events to a non-default main loop context.  

e.g. (does not work)
DBusGConnection *bus
GError *error = NULL

GMainContext *context = g_main_context_new()         
GMainLoop *mainloop = g_main_loop_new (context FALSE)
bus = dbus_g_bus_get(DBUS_BUS_SESSION 
dbus_connection_setup_with_g_main (dbus_g_connection_get_connection(bus) context) 

--------------
I looked into this problem and this is what I found out (in dbus/dbus-gmain.c):

When DBus-GLib switches to a new context it calls add_watch() to attach an IOHandler to poll the file descriptor used for communication.  Immediately afterward DBus invokes DBus-GLib's remove_watch() function which removes the new IOHandler instead of the one corresponding to the previous context.  Also the previous IOHandler should be already freed the second time connection_setup_add_watch is called (line 277:   dbus_watch_set_data (watch handler io_handler_watch_freed) ).  
I believe remove_watch() should not be called after add_watch().

"POPPLER-101526","Division by zero in Stream.cc:471","Created attachment 132096
Proof of concept

There is a division by zero in Stream.cc:471. In the ImageStream constructor INT_MAX is divided by nComps parsing the attached PoC.pdf case nComps has the value 0. The division by 0 caused a SIGFPE crash

 461 ImageStream::ImageStream(Stream *strA int widthA int nCompsA int nBitsA) {
 462   int imgLineSize
 463 
 464   str = strA
 465   width = widthA
 466   nComps = nCompsA
 467   nBits = nBitsA
 468 
 469   nVals = width * nComps
 470   inputLineSize = (nVals * nBits + 7) >> 3
 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {
 472     inputLineSize = -1
 473   }

A possible solution is to check for this case:
 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || nComps ==0 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {

"XORG-3048","External monitor inoperable on GeForce4 MX with AGP8X (Mac)","I am trying to get a sensible signal onto the external VGA connector of an iMac
G5 (PCI id of video chip 10de:0189 the name above is taken from nv_driver.c). 
I'm running a self-built x.org 6.8.2 (2005-2-9). 

Although a quick look into the nv sources seems to indicate that there is at
least some support for head selection (or even multi-headed operation?) I did
not succeed.

Here is what I tried:

(a) Plain Driver nv: No signal the external  connector

(b) Option CrtcNumber 1 in Device section: No valid modes found.  The log
says (among other things):

(II) NV(0): I2C device DDC:ddc2 removed.
(**) NV(0): Forcing CRTCNumber 1 as specified
(II) NV(0): Using DFP on CRTC 1
(--) NV(0): Panel size is 1 x 1

xorg then of course removes all video modes

(c) additionally
	Option FlatPanel false
in Device Section and an External Screen reference in ServerLayout where

Section Monitor
	Identifier	External VGA
	HorizSync	28-130
	VertRefresh	43-90
EndSection

and
Section Screen
	Identifier	External Screen
	Device		Nvidia G5
	Monitor		External VGA
[Modes definition]
EndSection

Some signal on the external VGA port DCC runs and identifies the device
attached (in my case a beamer).  xorg correctly finds some modes and chooses
the default one (1280x1024).  The beamer senses 1280x1024 too but does not
display anything (or rather black).  However the built-in panel now displays
funky patterns -- always the same ones so I assume it's gdm's login screen at
horribly wrong depth and resolution.  On terminating the server the beamer
senses a loss of video signal.

Phenomena analogous to (c) occur when I try a ServerLayout with two screens.

Ideally I'd like to mirror the LCD on the external monitor.  Any chance this
will ever work (unless nvidia cooperates)?

I'd be willing to help fix this but I'd highly appreciate pointers to
documentation in whatever form.",677,"1"

Test program to reproduce the error.

While working on some OpenGL tutorials I found that on my computer with Intel graphics the fragment shader has problems - colours were coming out incorrect at first (works fine on my RX580).  When I tried to simplify the shader to narrow down the cause the program started crashing during compilation of the shader with the error:

   corrupted size vs. prev_size
   Aborted (core dumped)

I compiled a debug version of Mesa (19.0.3) and got the following stack trace of the crash:

Screenshot of the language filter list from the Add Layout dialog box

A dialog box in KDE Keyboard Layout allows to filter layouts by their language. In this list are 4 entries named simply: fr mng scr and trv (see screenshot).

fr contains:
- a duplicate of the French (Canada) layout also found under French
- a Bambara layout only available under the fr language entry despite the fact that the Bambara language is listed. Maybe the one under fr should be moved to the Bambara entry uniting the French and English layouts?

The other 3 are either wrongly labelled or incorrectly linked to the layouts they contain. Presently mng is tied to the Mongolian layout scr has Croatian and trv Taiwanese. But according to the iso-codes bug report linked below: mng is Eastern Mnong scr is a retired code for Croatian and trv is Taroko.

Since KDE and iso-codes deny being the source of this problem xkeyboard-config seems to be the only one remaining.

Tested with xkeyboard-config 2.7 and iso-codes 3.38 and 3.40.

Xorg log file from current session

The Wine folks told me that it is probably a driver bug what I reported in their bug tracker. I copy the original text I have posted there:

---
When running World of Warcraft using Intel GMA X3000 with xorg-server
1.4.99.905 and xf86-video-i810 2.3.2 I get only garbage on the screen (see
attachments). There is a difference between using the -opengl switch of WoW or
not but in both cases only garbage is displayed. The problem is the same with
Wine 1.0 as with Wine 1.1.0. 

Eventually when moving the mouse for some seconds X hangs up: It seems like
the graphics card is turning on and off infinitely. The screen switches between
displaying nothing and displaying a black screen. No more switching to a VT
with Ctrl-Alt-F? is possible.

1. Remove the locale check and rely on the fontconfig-provided strtod implementation in all cases rather than using the libc one only if the decimal_point is .. This seems preferable in general as it prevents behavior from potentially differing based on locale.
2. Add a configure check for a working lconv struct containing a decimal_point field and #ifdef out the check if it's not present. This maintains current behavior on locales where the decimal point is . but adds complexity and any case where it causes problems would cause the same problems in other locales anyway.",8,"0"

"XORG-3674","Display problem (horizontal dark lines) on 17inch widescreen KISS Technology TFT monitor","I have a 17inch widescreen TFT monitor made by Kiss Technology.
Their website is being overhauled atm but I found direct links to the monitor
info and brochure page: http://www.kiss-technology.com/?p=coolview3

I have a creative GeForce2 GTS (nvidia) graphics card.

The problem: the colour of the display is darker with horizontal bands from
'bleed' of colour i.e. the relatively darker colour of the titlebar of a window
will spread outwards left and right from the window to fill the screen.

monitor-edid output is:

This does pose an immediate question. Why is it suggesting 1280x1024 when it is
a widescreen monitor surely it should be suggesting 1280x768 (even Kiss website
lists that as the max resolution)?

Test program using GLUT to reproduce the crash

At least happens on Mesa commit id 1681bd7f2b392d0b379cb0ff43a4fac33da74762 and also on Mesa 9.1.4 that is in Debian testing repositories at the moment.

I have attached a short test program to reproduce the crash.

The crash occurs if you create and put data to a GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY using a compressed texture format while the number of textures in the array is greater than 1 and then call glGenerateMipmap.

I'm not entirely sure if you are supposed to be able to generate mipmaps with glGenerateMipmap if the zero layer texture is in compressed format but I'd think it should at least fail gracefully if this is the case.

To make things worse wl_data_device.data_offer *event* creates a new wl_data_offer protocol object.

If a client has destroyed a wl_data_device the server will not know about it and will keep sending data_offer events as appropriate. As the client does not track the wl_data_device object anymore those events will be ignored in the client. This means that in the server wl_data_offer objects just keep piling up as the server cannot destroy them on its own.

    radeon/radeon_platform_probe: fix Zaphod mode breakage
    
    Using radeon_platform_probe function breaks the Zaphod mode because
    it attempts to call xf86AddEntityToScreen multiple times but nobody
    calls xf86SetEntityShared prior to that. Consequently calls for all
    but first device instance fail.
    
    Prior to introduction of platform bus the logic was that the Probe
    function would make the entity sharable which would cause Xserver
    to later make it shared prior to adding it to screen. With the
    platform bus loading add to screen happens in the probe
    function so we have to make it shared there.

2.Selected the folder to export to named the file and changed LDIF to Comma separated. Then Saved the file.

3. opened the file in LibreOffice (3.4.3) spreadsheet got text inport window for .csv imported it.  Then did find on the three names. One was there because it was there before upgrades and was just an email address change but the other two were not there at all both added after upgrades.

I hate to attach spreadsheet since it has a lot of personal information that I do not have permission to release.
   
Did some additional testing and problems appears to be in the LibreOffice spreadsheet. If I open the .csv with koffice2-kspread or gnumeric the missing contacts are there. If I open it with kwrite they are there. If I try lilberoffice-calc they do not appear.

translated properties file for pt-BR LightProof UI

Sentence checking is implemented thru Lightproof and is closely tied to the language.

Some languages have rules that do not match en_US set of rules. These extra rules are not covered by pootle because there is no entry for them. The present scheme created localized UI based on the en_US UI and thus extra entries appears untranslated.

For example pt-BR version of LightProof implements pleonasms and paronyms detections. These rules are not in the en_US version of Lightproof.

The build system creates the localized *.properties files based on the american properties file.

Local Lightproof developers can supply easily the localized properties file. To simplify the translation process I suggest we remove LightProof UI from pootle and get the translated file directly from LP developers.

See gerrit commit http://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/4146/ for the pt-BR example

At least in the pt-BR case this can be easily fixed.",11,"0"

May be unrelated but this is printed to the console:

agent: Handle EWOULDBLOCK when transmitting pseudo-TCP segments

As reported on the mailing list[1] the pseudo-TCP code currently aborts the connection if it receives EWOULDBLOCK when transmitting. This is not great.

Patch attached to fix this. The patch is also not great but definitely better than letting the issue persist.

Also available in git form[2].

Thanks to Radosław Kołodziejczyk for identifying and debugging this.

In contrast 2.6.38 on my desktop reported eight attempts on each of pin 0 and pin 6 after which it moved on with no further messages from the DRM subsystem.  (I haven't tested with older kernel versions on my laptop should I?)

Screenshot of bug

Static lightning is broken in the game CoreBreach. This happens with all the drivers I have tried so it's probably a general Mesa problem.

This is not a problem on git master. I bisected to find the commit which fixed this problem hoping it could be cherry picked for the next stable release:

commit 719909698c67c287a393d2380278e7b7495ae018
Author: Ian Romanick 
Date:   Tue Oct 18 16:01:49 2011 -0700

    mesa: Rewrite the way uniforms are tracked and handled
    
Considering the size of the change it seems unlikely to be suitable for this. Maybe someone could have a look at this and see if a smaller fix is possible for 7.11?

Author:     Juan A. Suarez Romero 
glsl/linker: link-error using the same name in unnamed block and outside

According with OpenGL GLSL 4.20 spec section 4.3.9 page 57:

   It is a link-time error if any particular shader interface
    contains:
      - two different blocks each having no instance name and each
        having a member of the same name or
      - a variable outside a block and a block with no instance name
        where the variable has the same name as a member in the block.

This means that it is a link error if for example we have a vertex
shader with the following definition.

  layout(location=0) uniform Data { float a float b }

and a fragment shader with:

  uniform float a

As in both cases we refer to both uniforms as a and thus using
glGetUniformLocation() wouldn't know which one we mean.

This fixes KHR-GL*.shaders.uniform_block.common.name_matching.

test document with a small rectangle

The «Position and size» dialogue in LibreOffice Draw 4.2 can not shows size less than 10 mm in centimeters or millimeters units. It shows 1.00 cm or 10.00 mm for such objects

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Libre Office Draw.
2 Check that you use  centimeters or millimeters length units (Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice Draw -> General -> Unit of measurement).
3 Draw a rectangle with sizes less than 10 mm.
4 Select the rectangle
5 Open «Position and size» dialogue (Format -> Position and size)

Current behavior:
Width and Height fields show 1.00cm (or 10.00mm)

Expected behavior:
The fields should contain correct sizes of the object.

If you copy the object into LibreOffice Writer document and open «Position and size» dialogue there it shows correct sizes.

I met the problem in LibreOffice 4.2beta2 and 4.2.0.1 on Debian testing (“Jessie”) in VirtualBox. LibreOffice 4.1.2.3 from Debian 7 (“Wheezy”) backports and 4.1.3.2 on Windows7 work without the problem.

I attach a test document with a small rectangle and a sceenshot with incorrect width and height.

Hi

I make test app which it contains 4 clips and 1 path and call cairo_fill() on cairo 1.11.3 (upstream latest)
Each clips may have different AA option and path has CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_DEFAULT.
In this scenario clipping doesn't work correctly.
If I change the AA of path to CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_NONE clipping works well.

As I analysis of cairo clip_and_composite_boxes() in cairo-spans-compositor.c has problem. 
Even I set clip on application composite_needs_clip() in composite_boxes() returns FALSE and call scan converter without clip information.

I attached test code with png files.

"LIBREOFFICE-82342","Other: (SVG import) Paths without explicit 'fill' property disappears instead of displaying black.","Problem description:
When importing an SVG image into a LibreOffice Writer or Impress document the image will display incorrectly and also becomes incorrect after exporting the document to PDF.

In particular the SVG paths and objects without an explicit 'fill' property disappears completely instead of showing a black path.

--------------------------

Steps to reproduce:
1. Save the test code above to test.svg
2. In LibreOffice Writer choose Insert -> Image -> From File and choose to import the test.svg
3. Export the document with the image as PDF.

Current behavior:
Only the right black square is shown in the document and the PDF file. The left one disappears.

Expected behavior:
Two black squares should be shown.

Xorg log of crash

My X crashes every time I try to open the module editor from the Kicad suite's pcbnew layout editor.
I have narrowed the problem down to SNA. I recompiled the xf86-video-intel driver with both SNA and UXA support (I'm on Funtoo so USE flags sna and uxa enabled).
When I change the AccelMethod to SNA my X crashes immediately when I try to launch the module editor.
When I change the AccelMethod to UXA the module editor launches correctly. So I'm forced to use UXA for now if I want to use Kicad.

I have Intel Core-i5 3570K (Ivy Bridge) CPU and I'm using the integrated HD graphics. (Asus P8Z77-V LE motherboard)

I'm using these commands to compile Kicad version 2011-07-08 from sources:

the package uim fails to build when using the linker flag --as-needed

The documentation for poppler_page_get_text_layout says:

The position in the array represents an offset in the text returned by poppler_page_get_text().

(Note that the documentation says the same for poppler_page_get_text_attributes).

However this doesn't seem to be the case. The problem is described succinctly here complete with a short piece code which reproduces the problem:

http://www.mail-archive.com/poppler@lists.freedesktop.org/msg06238.html

The linked PDF [1] gives 1541 glyphs from poppler_page_get_text and 1477 glyphs from poppler_page_get_text_layout. It does not appear to be related to unicode encoding.

In addition to the numbers of glyphs not agreeing the order doesn't seem to match up either from what I can tell.

This opens fine in Writer but once exported as docx the resulting document can only be opened in Word (tested with 2007) not Writer. Actually it can be opened but all pictures seem to be missing.

May be related to the fact that those pictures are inserted as character but that's just a guess.

"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-36123","Update Latvian keyboard mapping add Dvorak Colemak","Created attachment 45464
Add new Latvian keyboard layouts

I've added Dvorak Dvorak programmers and Colemak US compatible layouts to Latvian keyboard mapping.

I reformatted layout file since it had spaces and tabs all mixed also I improved readability and added few variants to layouts (like y-key variant for Dvorak)

The y-key variant for Dvorak seams like good idea to me because in Latvian we don't use y (unless someone writes Latgalian dialect) and it's easily reachable with strong pointing finger.",2,"0"
"XORG-66663","broken on big-endian systems","Created attachment 82134
patch

The current xf86-video-ati is broken on big-endian systems.  The problem is that
RADEON_TILING_SURFACE isn't set on the front buffer since commits ef9bfb262db7004bef3704e5d914687e50d3fca4 and e5bd99faa3b6629a55168386d5dfa936ee4e97ae.

As a result the RADEON_TILING_SWAP_32BIT and RADEON_TILING_SWAP_16BIT flags don't have any effect and any direct access to the front buffer will not do the necessary byte swapping.  The effect is blatantly obvious if you disable acceleration (option NoAccel on) but also happens with (EXA) acceleration enabled.  With acceleration disabled the colors are all wrong.  With acceleration enabled the background of my xterms is yellow when it should be white.

The attached patch fixes this but might reintroduce problems with page flipping as mentioned in https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33738 (the bug report that seems to have triggered the removal of the RADEON_TILING_SURFACE flag for the front buffer).  But only on big-endian platforms.",65,"0"

Distorted graphics

On my dell vostro laptop I get distorted graphics. I use Gnome3 shell.

See attached screen shot.

The kernel used is 3.6.3-1-ARCH.   

I found the problem is apparent with the versions 9.0-1 of ati-dri and
libgl and is not seen when I downgrade to the versions:

There are no visible rendering bugs in glxgears but in other apps many vertex program and ATI_fragment_programs do not work correctly(The commit above made the extensions show up as expected). Do these messages indicate that something deeper is wrong or are they just spam? The failing shaders include the DolphinVS.exe dx8 sdk sample when run with Wine the Bumpmap samples and vertex blend sample. I think the directx8 sdk is not publically available any more but I can try to write stand alone test apps to show these bugs if needed. (Wine uses GL_ATI_fragment_shader on r200 cards for fixed function fragment processing)

sample document which can cause OOo to crash (last footnote)

When hovering over a reference to a footnote a preview appears. However when
the footnote is long (> 4 lines) the preview is distorted (something I can
live with) and when it is very long (7 lines or more) OpenOffice crashes
taking with it the whole X server. This happens also with a clean user
directory so no corrupted personal settings.
I just found a Ubuntu bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/606602. Compiz
actually reports text length exceeded. It seems to be the same issue: OOo doesn't line-break in footnote previews - if the preview is
much too long for one line OOo does _something_ which 
-in Gome with Compiz (there's no information about the graphics) crashes
Compiz
-in XFCE with Compiz and proprietary Nvidia driver leaves just an empty
tooltip
-in KDE SC with KWin and free radeon driver crashes X.

It's very annoying because in my scientific writings I have a lot of long
footnotes and every now and then OOo crashes. It took me weeks to find out the
reason.

on) are displayed as withe fields but no crash.

1) compositing on + suspend/resume. At resume the screen is completely black and objects appear only flashing when the mouse goes over them.

2) compositing on + start/stop of the screensaver (same as above)

3) window movement (occasional freeze of the graphics stack)

4) attachment of an external screen when xrandr is used to set it not to clone the primary one (on the external screen the image is ok on the primary one the screen gets divided in two regions halfway. The top one shows what should be the bottom of the screen the bottom one shows garble).

5) screen saver starting when a secondary screen is attached and set not to clone the primary screen (occasional freeze of the graphics stack when the screensaver is stopped).

"XORG-15546","Radeon: Omit mask coordinates","Created attachment 15964
Patch skipping mask coordinates

For the last week or so I've been chasing curiously bad glyph
drawing (and other compositing) performance on R300. The observed 
behavior was that we could draw ~72000 vertices / second (and
thus 18000 boxes / second) without regard to the size of the
triangles or how much setup we were doing around them. Some 
investigation revealed that the problem was apparently calculating 
vertex coordinates in the VAP for texture 1 without having a texture 1.

For glyph drawing before and after performance is:

                 before         after
String length    glyphs/sec     glyphs/sec
-------------    ------------------------

50:              18248          173471

I also constructed a simpler benchmark that composited a
batch of N boxes of size MxM. (Using a clip region to 
get all the boxes in a batch drawn in a single go.)

(I hope bugzilla will not mangle the above tables)

The third column gives an idea of how much we can improve
further since it shows the same thing being done by the 
r300 3d driver which avoids the unnecessary repeated 
texture setup and cache flushing we are doing in the 2D
driver. We should be able to come close to the 1 million
glyph/sec mark for longer glyph strings of small characters.

The patch I'm attaching:

 - May not quite apply cleanly without the patches from
   bug 15371 but is independent.
 - Has only been tested on R300 not older or newer 
   cards. (I wanted to keep the coordinates we emitted
   the same everywhere though I suspect performance
   gains will be minimal elsewhere.)
 - Has only been tested for CP not MMIO

I don't think there will be any major problems on other
cards or MMIO but their might be typos or some register
that I forgot to adjust.",1,"0"

"POPPLER-4649","crash on click on input field in PDF","= Transfering this bug from GNOME Bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=316907 =

Distribution: Debian testing/unstable
Package: evince
Severity: critical
Version: GNOME2.10.2 0.4.x
Gnome-Distributor: Debian
Synopsis: Crashes when trying to fill in text
Bugzilla-Product: evince
Bugzilla-Component: general
Bugzilla-Version: 0.4.x
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.10.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:
My credit card company sends me statements. There's a little text box
for me to fill in for how much I'm paying on my bill. When I tried to
click there evince crashed. The PDF is from Chase FYI.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. Open PDF from CC company
2. Try to fill in Amount Enclosed
3. Crash!

Expected Results:
CC company receives money and stops hounding me for more.

How often does this happen?
Very rarely I'm poor.

Additional Information:
Even though they say I need Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.1 can I use this as
an excuse for not paying my bill and get some kind of deference? -)

"LIBREOFFICE-36013","Writer crashes when on documents that contains >=2^16 style changes","I open the document and when I close it I consistently get a Writer crash. The
sample document that causes the crash can be found here http://dict.linux.org.ua/other/sheludko.odt

The document has several styles which alternate frequently.

On (even) bigger documents I get crash when changing style properties or even when opening the document.

This is the same problem as https://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=84159 which was fixed in ooo dev-3.4. The problem though it was fixed quite inefficiently: the large document (2k-3k pages) I am working with took several minutes to open and almost 10 min to save on modern laptop in ooo <= 3.3. But in ooo dev-3.4 it took ~40min to open and it took almost 3 hours to save. Even closing the document in ooo dev-3.4 takes at least half an hour. So even though the crash is fixed this solution makes the office unusable for such documents.

It would be nice if this crash could be fixed but in more efficient way.",268,"1"

Screenshot showing systemd failing to boot

I upgraded systemd to version 44 on my exherbo system and ever since Systemd fails at boot time.

I've upgraded/reinstalled all the packages that install files to /etc/system/systemd and /lib/systemd and the directory /lib/systemd doesn't exist anymore. I've also checked for links under /etc/systemd and everything is in order.

(udev has been upgraded to 182.)

When system boots the root file system gets mounted successfully and systemd is started but freezes with the message failed to fully start up daemon: operation not permitted. The only option at this time is to hard reset my computer.

Systemd even fails to launch rescue and emergency shells with the same message.

Any pointers as to how I can debug this ?

I've tried to edit the source files inserting log_error statements to help diagnose the problem. It apparently continues to execute despite the above mentioned error message. I'm having hard time to figure out exactly at which point it bails out.

Any help in this direction will be highly appreciated.

Thanks

I can change desktop with the ctrl-alt-left ctrl-alt-right and ctrl-alt-down and I see the 3D cube effect but all the desktops are completely blank.

The same set up works on two of my older systems (i86-32 with older Radeon AGP cards) with the same X server (from the xserver-xorg-video-radeon package) so I am not certain whether the problem is with the X server the 3D acceleration libgl1-mesa-glx or compiz.  But it seems to me that the 3D acceleration is the likely suspect though we must credit AMD/ATI Technologies for withholding documentation.

Background: If you use the File Wizards menu - it throws up a UI using Java to create documents. This causes some nasty problems on machines with mis-configured (or not present) Java and of course presents a serious performance challenge. Since we bundle our own Python run-time anyway it would be ideal to run a python to java converter across the code to drop this dependency. This should be made easier by the existing Java code using UNO APIs to create its GUI. The wizards code lives in: wizards/com/sun/star/ and it would (most likely) be best to start off by converting something smaller - like the 'fax' wizard first - which is sub 1000 lines. Of course if you prefer native C++ to python using that instead would be an option too.

"POPPLER-46744","[patch] pdftops git 29feb12 -passfonts regression","Created attachment 57789
patch against poppler cloned from git on 29Feb12

When a PDF references a non-embedded font the git version of pdftops ignores -passfonts and attempts to embed an external font.

This is a regression from 0.18.4 on two counts.

First when pdftops embeds the font it creates a font with the name referenced in the pdf even if it embeds a substitute.  This makes the generated EPS file misleading because pre-flight scans of the EPS won't generate warnings about missing fonts but the file will print incorrectly even if the printer has the correct font.

Second even if pdftops embeds a font with the same name the font might be different for example the Linux system running pdftops might have a low quality free font while the printer might have a high quality commercial font.

In addition I have a workflow with a lot of little files that all use a small number of fonts.  For a sample 2326 byte PDF pdftops 0.18.4 generated a 18080 byte EPS while the new git version generates a 1157015 byte EPS over 60X as large due to the embedded font (which happens to be a substitution anyway).  I have to build PS pages that each contain several hundred of these files and all of the extra copies of the font add up.

It seems like someone tried to replace psSubstFonts with psFontPassthrough in GlobalParams but pdftops.cc sets psSubstFonts while GfxFont.cc tests psFontPassthrough.  I made the smallest change to get -passfonts working which was restoring GlobalParams::getPSSubstFonts() and testing globalParams->getPSSubstFonts() in GfxFont::locateFont().  This restores the behavior of 0.18.4 (and previous versions).

This worked as far back as 3817a54912a6c51fa0a7ec64787a69007bda44fa but could be tricky to bisect as both 7.8 and 7.7 causes the GPU to hang.

commit 00144cb77fd3afc05cfb4183b44e16a8bab175c0

    make: Make util libraries shared in non-windows systems
    
    Incremental builds take long time linking tests if utilities are
    modified. The link time can be eliminate if libraries are made shared.
    
    Shared libraries need to specify symbols that are excepted to be
    declared in executeable as weak to allow linking without symbols that
    aren't used in runtime.
    
    Windows has limitation that shared library can't have programs main
    function that forces windows to use static libraries.

"LIBREOFFICE-79028","UI: XY-scatter diagrams reset Major Interval axis date settings","Steps to reproduce:

Open Calc with a new document.  Format two colums with format [HH]:MM. This format interprets numbers as hours where 1 corresponds to 24:00 2 gives 48:00 and so on. Enter some data. Create a XY diagram that displays these data. Try to format the Y axis of the diagram: Uncheck all automatic scaling options. Set the main interval (?) (German: Hauptintervall) to some value other than 24:00:00 (i.e.  the value given by the automatic setting). Click OK to save the settings. The Y axis of the diagram shows the marks as specified. Open the dialog box to format the Y axis again.


Current behavior:

The dialog box shows 24:00:00 as main increment clicking OK changes the settings of the Y axis accordingly.
Formatting the X axis shows the same problem.


Expected behavior:

The main increment should show the same value as before and clicking OK without doing any changes should not change the diagram.

Problem description: 
Calc sorts columns the wrong way

Steps to reproduce:
There is an error in sorting columns in calc.

How to test:
Create a spread sheet similar to this

   C A D B F E
R1   a d
R2       b   e
R3 c       f

Mark the columns labled C A...E
Sort the columns ascending

Expected behavior:

   A B C D E F
R1 a     d
R2   b     e
R3     c     f

Current behavior:

   C A D B F E
R1 c       f
R2   a d
R3       b   e

This is very nasty since programs like KWord which rely on xdpyinfo do not work
at all.

xdpyinfo should perhaps return the dpi value for the primary screen featuring

5.1 x 5.2 dpmm = 132 x 133 dpi (370 230)

*but* as soon as I do continue in gdb and click away the error dialog the above cat command succeeds!

So it seems LibreOffice somehow tries to open the file twice and keeps itself from doing it (!) through some kind of lock.

Here's what an strace shows:

8679  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt  
8679   {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  open(/path/to/filename.odt O_RDWR|O_EXCL) = 65
8550  fstat(65 {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  fcntl(65 F_SETLK {type=F_WRLCK whence=SEEK_SET start=0 len=0}) = 0

I notice the open is with O_RDWR|O_EXCL. man 2 open says:

 The behavior of O_EXCL is undefined if O_CREAT is not specified.

So LibreOffice should not do that!!!

Then LibreOffice acquires a fcntl exclusive write-lock on the *whole* file (len=0 has the special meaning: until the end of the file).

Then it does several consecutive pread calls on the file several of which are REDUNDANT:

8550  time(NULL)                        = 1357298553
8550  time(NULL)                        = 1357298553

8550  pread(65 h\0162\345\3K\351\2Y\30\6Sp\331\352\205\202\311\215\343\36@\303K\201\22\6\241TzHM... 4096 28672) = 4096
8550  time(NULL)                        = 1357298553

It calls:
 pread(65 4096 0) THREE TIMES
 pread(65 4096 28672) THREE TIMES
 pread(65 4096 32768) TWO TIMES

a bit later:

8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  access(/path/to/filename.odt F_OK) = 0
8550  lstat(/path/to/filename.odt {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0

(two consecutive calls the access()...)

later it creates its lockfile:

8550  open(/path/to/.~lock.filename.odt# O_RDONLY|O_EXCL) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
8550  open(/path/to/.~lock.filename.odt# O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL 0666) = 69

a few more times access && lstat on the file... and finally it opens the file a second time:

8550  open(/path/to/filename.odt O_RDONLY) = 68
8550  fstat(68 {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600 st_size=32957 ...}) = 0
8550  open(/tmp/luj8dx80.tmp/luj8dxdw.tmp O_WRONLY|O_CREAT 0100600) = 69
8550  pread(68 PK\3\4\24\0\0\10\0\0\224P$B^\3062\f'\0\0\0'\0\0\0\10\0\0\0mi... 32767 0) = 8192
8550  write(69 PK\3\4\24\0\0\10\0\0\224P$B^\3062\f'\0\0\0'\0\0\0\10\0\0\0mi... 8192) = 8192
8550  pread(68 0x7fff93aa7850 24765 8192) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
550  close(68)                         = 0

I'm unsure why the first pread call there succeeds since the fcntl call locks the whole file maybe this is some bug/imperfection in the Linux CIFS FS or the Windows file server lock this fcntl() call maps to. Anyway the second pread call fails as should be the case because of the fcntl lock.

LibreOffice then reads from and writes to the file from the first (R/W) fd (again in redundant ways...):

pread(65 WQ'\212\n\305\3D\250n\351\31\341\22\221\35\252\323\374\236\351\232\223Nt\2752\232\6\352\304\352... 4096 4096) = 4096

Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config fileFontconfig error: Cannot load default config fileFAIL test-bz89617.exe (exit status: 1)


Here's why.

All the program in the msys distribution are built against msys-1.0.dll which among other things translate paths between unix and windows style.
That allows the autotool's generated files like configure
to be used to build native windows applications with the mingw compiler.

In fontconfig's test suite the first program that fails is run-test.sh
a shell script that use the pwd command to retrieve
a unix style current working directory which is then used to generate a configuration file for fc-list and fc-scan.
fc-list and fc-scan are native windows program and doesn't know how to handle unix paths.

Fortunately msys's pwd has a special '-W' option which print the path in windows style.
And the $OSTYPE environment variable can be checked to detect when the script is run on msys.



Now for test-bz89617 i would like to fix it too but
but i don't know what is it supposed to test exactly ?

Wouldn't it be better to call FcConfigCreate() instead of FcConfigGetCurrent() ?

int
main (void)
{
    FcConfig *config = FcConfigCreate ()

    if (!FcConfigAppFontAddFile (config SRCDIR /4x6.pcf) ||
	FcConfigAppFontAddFile (config /dev/null))
	return 1

    return 0
}

I tried it and it works but i don't know if it divert from the original goal of the test.

I'm sending a patch for run-test.sh.
If you're happy with it could you please commit it to the future releases?

"TELEPATHY-34091","Allow TpSimplePasswordManager to be used with custom channels","In bug #33485 I proposed an additional interface for SASLAuthentication channels that would allow the client to indicate to the CM whether the password should be cached in the CM.  If the channel implemented this additional interface it would no longer be possible to use TpSimplePasswordManager since the channel itself is completely hidden from the API user.  So I propose to modify the password manager API in a couple ways to allow the user to specify custom channels to be used with the password manager:
- expose the TpSimplePasswordChannel class as public API that can be used as a base class
- Add an alternative to tp_simple_password_manager_prompt_async() that takes a channel as a parameter.

Proposed changes have been implemented in the following branch: http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=user/jonathon/telepathy-gliba=shortlogh=refs/heads/credentials-storage",15,"0"

"WAYLAND-90677","redundant declarations compiler warnings in protocol headers","Since commit e799b1fa9c (scanner: add a new --include-core-only option) the compiler outputs warnings in some cases when using the -Wredundant-decls flag.

Generated protocol headers include forward declarations for the protocol interfaces type and extern declarations for the interfaces implementation. The new code also adds those declarations for interfaces that are defined by another extension. This can lead to redundant declarations.

For example if we have an extension protocol with the following interface:


  
    
  


The foo-client-protocol.h file will declare:

struct wl_surface
extern const struct wl_interface wl_surface_interface

which are already declared in wayland-client-protocol.h. So the compiler will output a warning if both headers are included.

Here are solutions thought of on IRC:

 1/ only add the extern declarations in the protocol header for interfaces declared in the xml file not for interfaces that are from a different extension. This is the old behaviour and only breaks client code that uses requests which create an object from a different extension. This is bad design and can be easily fixed by including the other extension protocol header first.

 2/ guard each extern declaration with an #ifndef. This will not work when mixing with old headers which do not have the guards.",5,"0"

If you do it the other way round (install dbus run dbus-uuidgen --ensure install systemd run systemd-machine-id-setup) then it works as expected: we generate a D-Bus machine ID then systemd-machine-id-setup just copies it.

"XORG-10854","Titlebar buttons don't function after full-screen mode","With some gnome apps which have a full-screen mode (e.g. eog or totem) the buttons on the title bar for close maximize and minimize don't function after returning from full-screen to normal view.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start compiz then open an image in eog (Image Viewer).
2. From eog's View menu select Full Screen.
3. Click Leave Full Screen to return to normal view.
4. Click the close button on the title bar of eog.

Actual results: Nothing happens.
Expected results: eog should close.

This happens (100% for me) in eog and in totem. I am using compiz 0.51 with Ubuntu 7.04.",644,"1"

... attachment is:

http://en.libreofficeforum.org/sites/libreofficeforum.org/files/uploads/Agrajag_files/2030%20RAW%20TEST.xlsx

It appears to contain a PowerPivot Data connection (Microsoft_SQLServer_AnalysisServices) rather than the usual XML data structure. The file fails to open (appears to hang using ~100% CPU) under GNU/Linux using any of these versions:

- v4.1.6.2 Build ID: 40ff705089295be5be0aae9b15123f687c05b0a

Under GNU/Linux using:

- v3.5.7.2 Build ID: 3215f89-f603614-ab984f2-7348103-1225a5b

... the file does open after approx. 1min 30sec using ~100% during this time.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open attachment.

Current behavior: Calc hangs at ~100% CPU usage.

Expected behavior: File is opened as expected.

"XORG-17590","nv driver improperly detects devices in autoconfigure mode","When I try to run Xorg -configure with NVidia card I get xorg.conf with all NVidia devices matched as video cards and in second run Xorg bails out because of mismatch in screens number and actual detected devices. This happens because nv driver exports such info about supported devices:

/* For now just match any NVIDIA PCI device and sort through them in the probe
 * routine */
static const struct pci_id_match NVPciIdMatchList[] = {
    { PCI_VENDOR_NVIDIA PCI_MATCH_ANY PCI_MATCH_ANY PCI_MATCH_ANY 0 0 0 }
    { PCI_VENDOR_NVIDIA_SGS PCI_MATCH_ANY PCI_MATCH_ANY PCI_MATCH_ANY 0 0 0}
    { 0 0 0 }
}

and add_matching_devices_to_configure_list function treats all NVidia's PCI devices as videocards and adds corresponding sections to xorg.conf. And in second -configure pass I have such output:

WindowMaker screen

The output is partially corrupted on xorg server 1.6.3 and Intel drivers 2.8.0 and newer running on the Latitude 100L laptop with the Intel 852GM adapter. E.g. the xterm windows produce burst and scattered glyphs and the glxgears windows produce 5 copies of cogwheels overlaid. Also there's garbage after windows move/resize/etc.

Downgrading the Intel drivers to 2.7.0 and 2.6.0 (as 2.5.0 won't compile) resolves the issue.

I'm attaching the photo of the part of the WindowMaker screen with the following visible: 
- incorrect TTF rendering in the xterm window (notice the scattered fragments of the text near the left edge of the screen -- those would partially remain on-screen if xterm window's moved or closed)
- glxgears with the 5 copies of cogs
- correct TTF rendering in the window titles
- correct bitmap and TTF rendering in the WindowMaker Appearance application",279,"1"

HD3850 Xorg log

On both X1600pro and HD3850 AGPs switching VT or quitting X will result in a blank but functioning VGA console CRT monitor will go into standby.

Does not happen with radeonhd/vesa/fglrx drivers.

On the X1600 switching back to the X VT would revive the monitor - this does not work with the HD3850.

Running the vesa driver first totally fixed the problem for the X1600 but although it fixes the vga console on switch/quit for the HD3850 it does not fix the loss of display when switching back to X with   .

The monitor goes in and out of dpms standby OK with both cards.

bash-3.2$ dmesg | grep -i vga
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25

I guess means I am not using any vesa/radeonfb.

If I connect svideo TV out on the HD3850 I do not loose that display when the monitor is not displaying console.",607,"1"

Reproducing steps: Update the intel driver from 2.8.1 to 2.9.0 and try to start the X server

Expected result: a running X server

Actual result: The screen goes black for a moment and then returns to  text console

Additional info:
Kernel mode setting is not activated. I have also tried with kernel mode setting activated. This did not work either.

I have identified the code change which leads to the regression:

Lines 1827 - 1829 in file i830_sdvo.c:
/* when there is no EDID it should be detected as disconnected */
if (!edid_mon)
    return XF86OutputStatusDisconnected

If I comment out these lines the X server starts up again and is normally usable. I cannot switch back to the text console though. The monitor then reports Out of range.

the scenario:

  0:  boot with HDMI (only) connected
  
  1:  connect the VGA cable (screen goes black for a second then comes back)
  2:  run startx

Repeat steps 1 through 5 three times and as soon as you press

Second the detail:
I have some drawing code in Qt which loops round and draws a background grid.
Here are the timings for several configurations:

"MESA-4327","texture mapping bug on unichrome","I'm seeing a really weird texture mapping bug on unichrome.  My app displays
really large images by specifying a reasonable sized texture (a tile size
256x256 or 512x512) and calling glTexSubImage2D() to update that texture with a
portion of the larger image.  The app then draws a textured quad for that
portion of the screen.  This is repeated for all the tiles that make up the image.

What I'm seeing appears to be a couple scanlines from one tiles swapped with a
couple scanlines from another tile.  In addition there seems to be a small
triangle of the swapped image in the lower left of each tile.

"MESA-31194","The mesa meta save/restore code doesn't ref the current GLSL program","The documentation for glDeleteProgram says that if the program to be deleted is currently bound then it won't actually be deleted until another program is selected. The mesa meta code tries to save and restore most of the GL state before using GL calls to do some operations including saving the GL program. However it just stores the GL program number and then calls glUseProgram(0) to disable it. If glDeleteProgram was already called on this program then this will end up freeing the program. When the meta code later tries to restore the state glUseProgram will throw a GL error because the saved program number is no longer valid.

Attached is an example program demonstrating the bug. It creates a fragment shader which just sets the fragment color to green. It makes the program current and then immediately deletes it. It then draws two quads while the program is active but it calls glDrawPixels in between. glDrawPixels ends up using the meta save/restore code which causes the program to be deleted so the second quad ends up red.",1,"0"

After a suspend/resume cycle quite often X gets stuck: instead of being
shown the GNOME unlock dialog I just get a blank screen with the mouse
cursor in the middle of the screen. Sometimes I cannot move the mouse cursor anymore but not always. Sometimes GNOME's unlock dialog is partially visible as a grey area but without a visible text entry field.

X is not using 100% of CPU time I can still switch to a console and back
Restarting the gdm3 service (thus restarting X) gives me a working X
again. There are no obvious errors in dmesg Xorg.0.log nor
.xsession-errors. Often when this problem happens I moved from dual head to single head configuration while suspend but this may be just coincidence.

Find attached a proof-of-concept patch basically unchanged from
Ubuntu. As I am no programmer I still might have managed to break it
please doublecheck carefully!

This currently breaks parts of the testsuite which is using one instead
of one-module as module configuration filename.

Add text/x-scss and text/x-sass

Sass is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) pre-processor. The reference implementation is written in Ruby and available from:
http://sass-lang.com/

Sass has two syntaxes. The first is known as Sassy CSS (SCSS) and has the .scss file extension. The second older syntax is known as the indented syntax and has the .sass file extension. See:
http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html

Sass files can be used by a wide range of IDE tools e.g. gnome-code-assistance gtksourceview Atom NetBeans:
https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-code-assistance/commit/?id=f4c0f4a2bf1ee06a9f44c8384f03ea875dd33f0b

"MESA-11980","GL_EXT_stencil_two_side breaks shadows in warzone2100 since 6.5.3","Bug reported by Christian Ohm yesterday on the Debian BTS. Since Mesa 6.5.3 shadows are broken on r300 in Warzone2100 (starcrack-like game).

During the game alt-s toggles shadows on/off. On a r300 with mesa 6.5.[12] (or with whatever release on i945) it works fine. But 6.5.3 7.0.1 and current master head it basically toggles dark/light instead as if there were shadows everywhere.

It's easy to reproduce: install and launch warzone2100 (you might want to pass --window on the command line fullscreen didn't really work here). Start a new campaign (you may skip the text intro by pressing Esc) and press alt-s several times when the game appears to see the shadows being toggled.

I git bissected between 6.5.2 and 6.5.3 and found the following commit:

  commit 62efc4ba3eb53ca75abbe9b52feabe49a5fd56b5
  Author: Aapo Tahkola 
  Date:   Thu Jan 18 05:56:13 2007 +0200

      support as much of GL_EXT_stencil_two_side as we can. untested.



I reverted it on top of 6.5.3 it fixed the problem. I tried to revert on top of master but there are too many conflicts for me :(

Michel told me to check after disabling stencil_two_side in DRI conf but it didn't help unfortunately which is kind of surprising.

Let me know if you need more debugging for instance by reverting only part of the above commit.

I'd be nice to fix this in mesa_7_0_branch too.

thanks

i.e. the man page suggests to use 0. But on 64 bit platforms 0 and 
NULL are not the same therefore this causes problems and often 
crashes. I noticed this because mlterm used 0 instead of NULL in this 
function like written in the man page which made mlterm crash often 
on x86_64. To fix these crashes I only had to replace 0 -> NULL.

"LIBREOFFICE-63141","Spanish translation replaces Heading (Encabezado) with Header (Encabezamiento)","Created attachment 77459
ODT example created with LibO 3.5.7

Since LibO 3.6 all headings of my files saved with prior LibO version looked smaller. It still happens with LibO 4.0

I could not realize what was happening until today that I downloaded LibO 4.0.2 and didn't use the translated UI.
I will try to describe the problem carefully attaching a ODT file and 3 screenshots.

System: Kubuntu 12.04 with LibO 3.5.7 installed from repositories

Description:
The first screenshot shows a file created with LibO 3.5.7 installed from Kubuntu repos. All formating is done through styles.
So the header has a the Header style (translated as Encabezamiento en LibO 3.5 and prior) headings has their conrresponding Heading styles (Encabezados) and so for bodytext. 

The styles used in this file are:
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 14 pts
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 16.1 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: 9 pts

The second screenshot shows this file opened with LibO 4 without the spanish translation. It shows a correct formating of the file with exactly the same styles as defined in files saved with LibO 3.5.

The third screenshot shows the same file opened with LibO 4 but having already installed the translated UI.
Now the styles has become
· Encabezado/Heading: Liberation Sans 9 pts (as was Header)
· Encabezados/Heading 1: 115% of Heading = 10.3 pts
· Encabezamiento/Header: doesn't exist


So the problem is that the spanish translation is using Header in place of Heading. When saving this file with LibO 4 with spanish UI opening with Lib 3.5 looks also wrong with the modified styles.",178,"1"

This is horrid. We should be able to *ask* pkg-config what the first directory on its search path is and get it right in all cases. Or it should be possible to pass --pkgconfigdir= on the configure command line. Or something like that.

Steps how to reproduce with server installation of LibreOffice 3.5.7.2  German UI/Locale [Build-ID: 3215f89-f603614-ab984f2-7348103-1225a5b] on German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) 

0. Launch LibO
1. From Start center created new Presentation without using wizard
   > Shows slide with default contents Title Slide layout
2. In Layouts apply Title Content
   Shows Title + Single Line Outline with request Click to add text
3. Save -> Close -> Reopen
   > Expected: looks like did when save character size 32 or so for outline
   > Actual: visible character size 100 or so although still shown 32

Definitively a FILESAVE problem sample from 3.5.7.2 also loosks damaged when opened in 3.3.3

Was still ok with 3.3.3 and 3.4.5

No longer reproducible with parallel Dev-installation of  Version 4.1.0.0.alpha0+ (Build ID: 094bab7f9097fba62800d3dd578bd42640d8c6e2) TinderBox: Win-x86@6 Branch:master Pull Time: 2013-03-18_01:35:56 ENGLISH UI / German Locale on German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) with LODev/4 Masters User Profile.

The bug vanishes if only suspend to ram or suspend to disk is used.

I tried to do a bisect but a number of rc kernels seem to hang on me long before radeon module is loaded. At this point bisect

I suspected that the new async suspend/resume code might be at fault as I was seeing video card been turned off (aka monitor  going off) and then turning on a moment before shutting down completely.

So I found the commits of the async suspend (from an article) and reverted them.

    llvmpipe: fix blending with half-float formats
    
    The fact that we flush denorms to zero breaks our half-float
    conversion and blending. This patches enables denorms for
    blending. It's a little tricky due to the llvm bug that makes

"POPPLER-80093","does not render ligatures for TeX Gyre Termes font anymore","Dear poppler devs

I'd like to bring an issue between poppler and the TeX Gyre Hermes fonts to your attention. The TeX Gyre fonts are high-quality replacements for the Base35 Ghostscripts fonts and are thus prefered by fontconfig for text rendering. TeX Gyre Hermes is the replacement for Times in this set.

However there is one issue with the OTF font files of that fonf: They have their fi fl etc. ligature glyphs named f_i f_l etc. This leads to the situation that these glyphs are not recognized by poppler anymore and texts set in Times and rendered with TeX Gyre Hermes contain white spaces where the ligatures should be.

This was reported to work well with previous versions of poppler (around 0.18) but does not with recent versions so it should be considered a regression. The issue has been reported to the Debian bug tracker here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742767

and has been discussed on the fontconfig bug tracker here:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73291

until the fontconfig devs found that issue would be solved by kicking the TeX Gyre Hermes font out of the list of valid replacements for Times. :/

I'd like to ask you to change poppler to be more tolerant and accept the glyphs called f_i f_l etc. as aliases for fi and fl etc. They are valid ligatures glyphs.

Thank you very much!

[Problem]
X freeze triggered by Klondike Solitaire on 945G graphics on ASUSTeK Computer.

[Discussion]


The X system crashed while playing Solitaire Aisleriot.

Ubuntu 8.10 all packages upgraded as of today 15-11-2008.

Solitaire froze while dragging a card. Then the display disappeared. I saw a dialogue box about a safe mode or something I didn't have the time to read even less to click OK. I didn't get safe mode or any other mode working. Neither Ctrl+Alt+F1 or Alt+F1 worked to log in in another terminal and emit a shutdown. I had to reset the computer.
This is the third time I think since I upgraded to 8.10 Intrepid. It never happened before. I do not know whether the problem lies with /usr/games/sol or with the X system (or gdm). (I do now I was playing Solitaire also on the second crash. I do not remember for the first one.) Anyway it is extremely serious because one could be running something important in the background but it was impossible to regain control of the system without a reset.

patch for viewres

These five apps copy e.g. app-defaults/Viewres.ad to app-defaults/Viewres but don't ensure that the directory ./app-defaults exists. Thus a VPATH build (objdir != srcdir) will fail.

Historically in the monolithic build Viewres.ad was installed as Viewres by a suitable imake rule. The reason for this certainly was the fact that an executable viewres and an app default file Viewres cannot coexist on a case insensitive filesystem.

For the modular build automake requires (sort of) to create a file Viewres that will then be installed. In order to cope with case insensitive filesystems that is now done in a subdirectory app-defaults. This however allows to distribute the app default files under their final names no need to copy them no need to ensure the existence of ./app-defaults.

Moreover defining them as dist_appdefault_DATA avoids the necessity to mention them under EXTRA_DIST. All this simplifies Makefile.am considerably.

Attached are five small patches along these lines for the five apps mentioned above.",16,"0"

Following a section with endnotes collected at the end of that section the pagebreak in a subsequent paragraph-style (ie. a paragraph following that section) is not honoured if the end-notes project into the page on which that paragraph starts.

Inserting an extra empty paragraph would not really be a fix since it will corrupt the document-flow when the pagesize is altered to suit a different output (ie. e-book iPad optimalized or A4 paper to print).

"DRI-101111","[Regression] backlight flickering/display artifacting on Broadwell integrated graphics with 4.12-rc1","As of 4.12-rc1 the following regression happens:
On a laptop with integrated Broadwell 5500U graphics I am experiencing a slight but noticeable and extremely annoying backlight flickering. This is especially apparent when the screen brightness is adjusted high on dark grey backgrounds where there is a noticeable sort of constant flickering/variation in brightness of the background sometimes striated with thin lines but usually just flickering slightly lighter or darker. Of course this occurs at all brightness levels but is more obvious there. This problem has only been present as of the release of 4.12-rc1 and is also present on drm-tip and drm-intel-nightly. It seems related to the updates in the i915 Intel integrated graphics module. It's problematic enough to be a fairly major annoyance on the 5500U Broadwell SoC.

The following is my system configuration. I can confirm that this problem occurs even with the latest intel firmware/drivers in Ubuntu 17.04 as well as on my primary system running Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS and that it does not happen on 4.11.x or previous kernels.

A single monitor is connected to DVI but -ati is detecting and enabling both the DVI and VGA ports when it should only be enabling DVI.

even though nothing is connected to the VGA port.

[Original Report]
This is with the Gutsy daily desktop CD for amd64 from 2007/10/10.

Apps like gdm and gnome-panel put their bottom parts e.g. the bottom gnome-panel instance and the gdm button area about 2/3 to the bottom. I've attached some screenshots of this behavior. I couldn't figure it out until I went to the Screen and Graphics Preferences tool. It is autodecting a resolution of 1280x800 when the LCD screen is actually a normal 1280x1024 19 LCD. When I typed 'xrandr -q' I got:

Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200 current 1280 x 1024 maximum 1280 x 1200
VGA-0 connected 1280x800 0 0 (normal left inverted right) 0mm x 0mm
   1280x800 60.0*
   1280x768 60.0
   1024x768 60.0
   800x600 60.3
   640x480 59.9
DVI-0 connected 1280x1024 0 0 (normal left inverted right) 359mm x 287mm
   1280x1024 60.0* 59.9
   1024x768 75.1 60.0
   800x600 75.0 60.3
   640x480 75.0 60.0
   720x400 70.1

It seems as if GNOME apps assume that the screen is 1280x800 even though nothing is actually plugged into the VGA port. Once I dragged the panel down to the bottom it stays their across sessions. The other apps like gdm still have the odd behavior. The screenshots [in the downstream bug report] demonstrate this better than I can describe.

 * * *

I tried the latest Intrepid release and was able to boot the machine. It was more successful though still not correct.

The display came up in 1152x864 which on a 19 LCD was stretched. I went to System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution and 1280x1024 wasn't in the Resolution list. Mirror Screens was checked (though I only had the LCD plugged into DVI and nothing in the VGA) so I unchecked it. This caused the Resolution list to refresh so I chose 1280x1024. I hit Apply and it said it would write out the configuration and that I'd have to logout for the new configuration to take effect. I logged out and saw the gdm login screen which didn't seem quite optimal so I hit Control-Alt-Backspace to really restart X but it didn't look different.

When I logged in the bottom panel was at the very top of the screen and the desktop background was... hard to describe. It was as if someone took the smudge tool to the regular intrepid background and made long straight vertical streaks going from top to bottom. I managed to start a terminal and looked at the xorg.conf the previous step had created. It had written a Virtual size of 1280x1888 instead of 1280x1024. I manually edited this logged out hit Control-Alt-Backspace and logged in.

The resolution came up in 1152x864 again. I decided to try 'xrandr'. As in the xrandr output at the very top of this bug it believed I had a display attached to the VGA port when there wasn't anything plugged into it. I looked through 'xrandr -h' and invoked

  xrandr --output VGA-0 --off
  xrandr --output DVI-0 --preferred

and voila the screen changed to 1280x1024. I'm just guessing that the GNOME apps are relying on the xrandr information which is incorrect since there is no VGA attached though the xrandr mechanism thinks it is and uses it as the primary display. Perhaps this bug should be retitled?

    drm/i915: Reset GMBUS controller after NAK
    
    Once a NAK has been asserted by the slave we need to reset the GMBUS
    controller in order to continue. This is done by asserting the Software
    Clear Interrupt bit and then clearing it again to restore operations.
    
    If we don't clear the NAK then all future GMBUS xfers will fail
    including DDC probes and EDID retrieval.

"TELEPATHY-29728","ContactManager::addGroup and removeGroup are confusing/broken","ContactManager::addGroup is described as Attempt to add an user-defined contact list group. Therefore (and judging from the naming) one would expect that after the returned PendingOperation has finished successfully the group would have actually been added (I know right?) and would be usable for eg. adding contacts to it.

In reality however the PendingOperation finishes as soon as the underlying EnsureChannel D-Bus call to the CM has returned. While this is indeed when the group is actually added at the CM level at this point the ContactManager internals still haven't picked up the new group and for example trying to add a contact to the seemingly newly-added group fails! A work-around is to wait for the groupAdded signal for the group in question - but this is really error-prone as the signal may well have been emitted already (and will be if we fix this bug properly)!

The fix would be to make a private PendingOperation subclass which would first make the EnsureChannel call and if that's successful and the new group hasn't been picked up yet wait for the new group to be picked up (by the groupAdded() signal) before finishing. Then the operation being finished() would truly mean that the group is now usable by the usual methods manipulating it.

Similarly the removeGroup PendingOperation returns as soon as the Channel's Close method has returned (and the group has been removed from the server). However contacts can still seemingly be added to the group etc. until the channel being invalidated is picked up by the ContactManager internals and groupRemoved() is emitted (probably in the next few mainloop iterations)! This is less of a problem though as you generally shouldn't need to worry about a removed group anymore - it's still confusing however as the PendingOperation to eg. add a contact to a group in this state will probably fail with The method AddMembers on bahbah interface doesn't exist (because the Channel doesn't exist anymore) instead of the intended The group doesn't exist.

The fix for this then is obviously waiting for groupRemoved in the removeGroup PendingOperation if the group still exists in the ContactManager internals after the Channel has been closed.",131,"0"
"SYSTEMD-79576","udevd flock() failure on disk partitions due to fsck holding WRITE FLOCK","Created attachment 100341
uded.c:worker_new() flock() attempts debug

Hi

On upgrading from systemd-212 to systemd-213 my development system once again (see BR#75512) no longer is able to reliably mount non-root disk partitions listed in /etc/fstab at boot time. I say 'reliably' here as it is able to do sometimes but mosty not.

On this system I'm using MBR (not GPT) disk partitions and not using lvm.

My grub2 boot kernel line is:
  linux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.14.5 root=/dev/sda7 ro raid=noautodetect quiet

At boot I get the messages like
systemd-fsck[62]: /sbin/fsck.xfs: XFS file system.
[ * ] (1 of 4) A start job is running for dev-sda10.device. (1min 26s / 1min 30s)

The root partition is fine but no other sdaX partitions appear.

In appearence this issue results in the same behavior as described in BR#75512 however note that the kernel has been built with CONFIG_FHANDLE=y here.

I have traced this to systemd-213/src/udev/udevd.c:worker_new() where among other things the following code is new w.r.t sytemd-212

 285                         /*

 292                          */
 293                         if (streq_ptr(block udev_device_get_subsystem(dev))) {
 294                                 struct udev_device *d = dev
 295
 296                                 if (streq_ptr(partition udev_device_get_devtype(d)))
 297                                         d = udev_device_get_parent(d)
 298
 299                                 if (d) {

 301                                         if (fd_lock >= 0 && flock(fd_lock LOCK_SH|LOCK_NB) < 0) {

 306                                 }
 307                         }
 308

On reaching line 293 in worker_new() for all incoming /dev/sda{X} devices an attempt to flock()  device /dev/sda is made (lines 296-7 => the lock is always attempted on /dev/sda in these cases).

What is happenning is that an fsck process (see attachment) has already placed a WRITE FLOCK on  /dev/sda and so udev processing is skipped. When the problem occurs the result is that no udev processing is done for /dev/sda or any /dev/sdaX partitions.

I've attached a log of events with occur when the flock()'s fail (generated by simply adding some debug code between lines 302 and 303 (I simply print /proc/locks and from that get and print the pid/command(s) which hold FLOCKs). From this log it appears that fsck is holding a WRITE FLOCK before the first entry into worker_new(). Apparently this WRITE FLOCK is held long enough so that
udevd skips all /dev/sda{.X} processing (and I speculate that fsck is then unable to complete its work as well). Looks like a file lock deadlock between fsck and udevd ?

As noted above the problem doesn't always occur it occurs much more frequently on a simple sparsely populated system (9/10 times) than on a full desktop system (1/10 times).

Also if I add 
     systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=kmsg log_buf_len=1M
to the grub boot commandline it rarely occurs and even the addition of debugging code dramatically alters the frequency of occurrence.

In passing also note that it appears that the file close of fd_lock is not done if the 'goto skip' path is taken in the udevd.c code above.

As a temporary work-around I'm now using sytemd-213 without issue with lines 285-308 (plus several other associated lines) removed (thes lines are of course absent in sytemd-212).

I do not know enough about systemd and the kernel to move much further on this so any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks much

XRandR Verbose Ouput when connected to the Onkyo receiver at 1024x768

I'm trying to connect the HDMI output from my ASUS P5E-VM-HDMI motherboard to my receiver. 

I can get working 1280x720 (720p) output if I bypass the receiver and connect directly to my Samsung 42inch plasma. However that mode just shows up as a green screen when connected my receiver. The receiver is full 1080p compatible and will pass through those signals (my ps3 outputs 1080p which is down converted by the receiver to 720p for my tv).

I'm using debian unstable (kernel 2.6.24+13 xserver-xorg 1:7.3+10 xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.2.0.90-3)

There are numerous problems with getting HDMI to work on my receiver. I'll list them below

a) the latest driver (both latest git sources and the packaged 2.2.1 sources that was announced on the mailing list) hangs the system immediately when X starts. The system needs to be power toggled. The logs are all empty and I don't have the serial setup necessary to trap the kernel oops.
The 2.2.0 debian packaged driver works (but has issues as stated below). I have not tried the 2.2.1 driver with my tv.

b) the HDMI output is very flaky. I can get basic console output (i.e. no vga=x lines on grub) most of the time. But sometimes even this does not display. 

b) I managed to get the receiver into a mode where it would output 1024x768. I don't know what I did (console mode would not display in this state. i.e. the receiver would just say No Signal when I killed the xserver) but I did manage to extract xrandr and full /var/log/Xorg.log output. After a reboot I just get a black screen when starting X with the mode that these logs were extracted from. I've attached the logs which have full EDID dumps and supported resolutions. I've tried using those resolutions and nothing displays.

However even when the Onkyo was displaying at 1024x768 the display would go off every 3s or so (for about 1/2s each time).

c) 1280x720 works when connected to my tv directly. but just gives a green screen when connected to my receiver. I have the same 30 pixels to the left problem mentioned earlier as well when connected to my tv (using a smaller than 720p mode to correct for overscan)

d) I can get HDMI audio to work using the latest (1.16) Alsa drivers. however it only works in console mode. 

When connected to my receiver I get no audio or video (even when video worked during the collection of logs as described in b) ) the moment I enable the HDMI audio out IEC-1 device in alsamixer.

when connected to my tv when X is running turning on the IEC-1 device makes the screen flicker crazily. Every now and then the tv will lose signal and the screen will go blank. Any audio that is playing will cut out when signal is lost.

in both cases (receiver and tv) audio and video show no problems when in console mode. My receiver detects the HDMI audio as a pure audio source and plays it fine in console mode.

Kernel Log

System environment:
-- chipset: i7-4500U / HD 4400
-- system architecture: 64-bit
-- xf86-video-intel: 2:2.99.904-0ubuntu2.1
-- xserver: 7.7+1ubuntu6
-- mesa: n/a
-- libdrm: 2.4.46-1ubuntu1
-- kernel: 3.13 (native 3.11 Distrokernel of Xubuntu 13.10 showed same behaviour)
-- Linux distribution: Xubuntu 13.10
-- Machine or mobo model: Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga S1
-- Display connector: DisplayPort


This laptop only has a Mini-HDMI port builtin however using a Docking Station (OneLink Pro Dock) one gets a native DisplayPort (no USB graphics).

Attaching a monitor to the DP-Port of the Dock (Dell U2713HM with 2560x1440 native resolution) running xrandr it will only show resolutions up to 1920x1200 and these modes seem to be usable.

Trying to override the mode (using newmode addmode and --output DP1 --mode ...) results in Configure crtc 1 failed with both the EDID-provided values and manually cvt-generated values.

Judging by the Kernel log (attached) the DRM parses the EDID correctly but discards the 2560x1440 mode it provides.

As the monitor only supports its native Resolution over DP and I don't have any other Monitors with such a resolution I couldn't test if using the Mini-HDMI Port on the Laptop would allow for more than 1920x1200.

The monitor connected to the same machine and dock runs fine under Windows with its native resolution 2560x1440. It also works perfectly fine on Linux on my ThinkPad T420s (i5-2520M).",0,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-36950","Installation breaks 64-bit Windows Search of ODF files","Overview: Installing LibO causes text of all ODF files subsequently saved in LibO or OOo to be invisible in Windows Search in 64-bit versions of Windows.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Originally install OpenOffice.org in a 64-bit version of Windows.
2) Create/edit a file in any ODF format in OOo.
3) Close the document saving on exit.
4) Use Windows search to successfully find the ODF file from words in the text of the document.
5) Leave OOo installed.

Steps 1-5 are optional but demonstrate that Windows search finds text in ODF documents with OOo installed.

6) Install LibO in the 64-bit version of Windows.
7) Create/edit a file in any ODF format in either LibO or OOo.
8) Close the document saving on exit.
9) Search for words in the text of the ODF document using Windows search. The ODF document will not appear in search results.

Actual Results:
Installation of LibO prevents any ODF document saved on closing from being found in Windows search results both in LibO and OOo.

[Note: Saving an ODF document in LibO or OOo during editing rather than at closing does not trigger Windows to index the file so the previous index state persists. This may be considered a separate bug.]

Expected Results:
The ODF document appears in Windows search results for a search on any words exisiting in the text of the document.

Build and Platform:
LibO 3.3.2 release Windows 7 64-bit SP1 also reported on Windows Vista 64-bit.

Additional Information:
The attached file contains a report on errors in the Windows Registry with OOo 3.3.0 plus  by LibO 3.3.2 installed in that sequence.

The following 3 files are missing from the LibO installation:
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\shlxthdl_x64.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\ooofilt_x64.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\propertyhdl_x64.dll

Files of these names are present in the equivalent OpenOffice.org 3 folder. However note that the following 32-bit files differ from the files of the same names in the equivalent OpenOffice.org folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\shlxthdl.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\ooofilt.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\propertyhdl.dll

It is the installation of LibO that breaks the OpenDocument Format Filter registry key  which previously pointed to the OOo version of ooofilt_x64.dll and points it to the missing file in the LibO installation instead. This file is necessary for Windows to index ODF files. There are other errors as listed in the attached file.

"XORG-11080","X attempts to use shared memory even for ssh-proxied connections","Occasionally we have seen corruption of all of a Gtk-based X client's images when it connects across ssh.  Images are replaced by image data that clearly comes from another client connected to the server.

It appears that the client and server are attempting to send image data via the MIT-SHM shared memory extension even though the two are on different machines.

When the problem occurred I did some checks.  The X client was mapping a SysV shared memory segment:

betamax:~$ grep SYSV /proc/17565/maps
b550b000-b556b000 rw-s 00000000 00:08 425985     /SYSV00000000 (deleted)

Normally no SysV segments are mapped.  Furthermore the nattch parameter was 1 (no server had also mapped the segment).  For correctly-working X clients nattch=2.

betamax:~$ ipcs -m
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x00000000 425985     conductor 600        393216     1          dest

Listing shared memory segments on the machine running the X server reveals that the server happens to have a shared memory segment with the same ID (shmid=425985):

tonytheprawn:~$ ipcs -m
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid   owner    perms bytes  nattch status
0x00000000 393216  mseaborn 600   393216 2      dest
0x00000000 425985  mseaborn 600   393216 2      dest
... 

It appears that the X server and client do not check to see whether they are really on the same machine.  The client sends the server a memory segment ID.  If the server fails to map the segment it fails silently and the two fall back to the remote case.  However in this case the server is succeeding accidentally and is seeing an unrelated process's image data.

This is not surprising considering that the connection is proxied by ssh:  both the server and client believe they are connected to a local process via a Unix domain socket.

I can see two ways to fix this:

 * Add more checks to the client or server to check that they are on the same machine.  May involve adding parameters to the MIT-SHM X requests.
 * Provide a way for ssh to switch off the MIT-SHM extension on the connections it sets up.  Also requires some sort of protocol extension.

This may not be worth fixing.

There may be some security issues here.  Maybe an X client can use this to read unrelated processes' SysV shared memory segments on the X server's machine?",4031,"1"
"LIBREOFFICE-69271","VIEWING: SVG - class= taking precendence over explicitely defined style= [Regression]","Created attachment 85719
Particular SVG picture showing the regression and screenshots

Problem description: 

As of version 4.1.1 (possibly earlier) SVG picture Background - Gray.svg found in attached zip archive is not displayed correctly when inserted in LO Writer document.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the Front_page.odt document found in attached zip archive.

Current behavior:

In version 4.1.1 of LO Writer the picture is displayed in color instead of light gray. The light gray version of the picture was done by coloring colored version of the picture in light gray using Inkscape. As a result of that light gray color was defined explicitly in style= but the original color was left defined in class=. Here is an example from attached SVG:

<circle
   ...
   style=fill:#e8e8e8fill-opacity:1
   ....
   class=fil24
/>

where class fil24 is defined as:

.fil24 {fill:#2F6864}

In attached zip archive you will find screenshots of the document displayed in LO Writer version 4.0.5 and 4.1.1. It seems that class= is taking precedence over style= so picture is displayed colored instead of light gray.

The SVG picture is displayed correctly (light gray) in version 4.1.1 of LO Draw so only Writer is affected

Expected behavior:

Attached SVG picture should be displayed light gray.

    mesa: implement GL_ARB_texture_buffer_range
    
    v2: Record texObj.BufferSize as -1 in TexBuffer(non-Range) instead
    of the buffer's current size so we know we always have to use the
    full size of the buffer object (i.e. even if it changes without the
    user calling TexBuffer again) for the texture.
    
    Clarify invalid offset alignment error message.
    
    v3: Use extra GL_CORE-only section in get_hash_params.py for
    TEXTURE_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT.
    
    v4: Remove unnecessary check for profile in _mesa_TexBufferRange.
    Add check for extension enable in get_tex_level_parameter_buffer.
    
    v5: Fix position in gl_API.xml.
    Add comment about meaning of BufferSize == -1.
    
    v6: Add back checks for core profile and add a note about it.

"DRI-104195","[i915] [Device 591b] Backlight not working - wake from suspend not turning on monitor.","Hello.

i have a Thinkpad T470-P which is equipped with Intel HD graphics 630

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 591b (rev 04)

I tried upgrading graphics drivers with intel graphics update tool 2.06: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-update-tool-linux-os-v2.0.6

But it caused waking up from suspend to not work seems the screen is not enabled 

Also the adjusting of the backlight stops working. 

/sys/class/backlight is empty. Default there was a link to intel_backlight after playing with kernel option parameter backlight= set to vendor i get a link to lenovo_backlight but it does not work.



Backround info:

I have installed Kubuntu 17.04 It works almost fine out of the box.

The size of everything on the screen was very small so i scaled it to 1.1 in KDE settings. Increased fonts sizes and forced DPI to 120.

I have a big issue with text getting corrupt complete rows get messed up  most problem in Qtcreator but also noticed it in Konsole.

kernel module loaded for the graphics card is i915.

Xorg is default using fbdevhw when booting stock kernel and with kernel 4.14.4-041404.
 it is using modesetting driver with submodule fb.

I tried changing font changing font settings like anti aliasing sub pixel rendering e.t.c. without any luck.

I tried upgrading the kernel to 4.14.4-041404 upgrading the bios. 

So what needs to be done?

What is the correct setup? i.e:
    -which kernel module and version to use for intel HD graphics 630?
    - Any special kernel option parameter to set during boot?
    - which Xorg driver to use ?
    - Any special Xorg config options?
    - Any special KDE settings for fonts e.t.c. ?


Thank you.

"DRI-83184","Screen flickering at low resolution when monitor is attached via VGA dongle to DVI port","Created attachment 105377
dmesg output with drm debug information

Encountered a strange problem with Radeon HD 6250 (or HD 6310) on a Fujitsu D3003-S1x mainboard. Occurs with every tested linux distribution and older and newer kernels. 

Problem occurs only when a monitor is attached via VGA to the DVI port. If the monitor is attached via DVI then the problem does not occur.

Problem is that
- Monitor is flickering sporadically 
- Monitor resolution is fixed to 1024x768 instead of higher resolutions that are possible
- xrandr shows 2 monitors while just one monitor is attached

Tried to debug this with kernel parameter drm.debug=14 (dmesg log is attached) and found the following messages that would explain the flickering screen.

The problem is still to find the root cause that leads to the issue of having conflicting encoders. Any idea what could cause this behaviour?

The only callers are here and we will add generation of GL errors in
the following patch.  Rename the function to st_egl_image_get_surface
pass the gl_context instead of st_context and move the cast from
GLeglImageOES to void* into st_egl_image_get_surface.

commit	83e9de25f325f3fce78be864a9dd80e6274b8ca8 (patch)

st/mesa: EGLImageTarget* error handling
Stop trying to specify texture or renderbuffer objects for unsupported
EGL images. Generate the error codes specified in the OES_EGL_image
extension.

EGLImageTargetTexture2D and EGLImageTargetRenderbuffer would call
the pipe driver's create_surface callback without ever checking that
the given EGL image is actually compatible with the chosen target
texture or renderbuffer. This patch adds a call to the pipe driver's
is_format_supported callback and generates an INVALID_OPERATION error
for unsupported EGL images. If the EGL image handle does not describe
a valid EGL image an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.

v2: fixed get_surface to actually use the usage and error parameters

"XORG-26543","Mouse trapped on first screen using Xinerama - Regression from synaptics-fix-xinerama.patch","The problem as described and solved in http://bugs.gentoo.org/206614 (see also http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics/commit/?h=gentoo-patches&id=8efccb0a76833b31a8d0273b49dd584246a97c7d) was apparently reintroduced in the commit of http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics/commit/?id=c405a69f83dab77cfe6c76f718a3ca5614a85918 thus leading to a regression carried through all the way to the present version 1.2.1. 
The problem seems to be that using the priv->minx and priv->miny values instead of the default -1 in the call to xf86InitValuatorAxisStruct prevents the synaptic mouse pointer from crossing over to the second screen. If the mouse pointer is moved to the second screen e.g. using an external mouse it works normally on the other screen also with the synaptics pad but gets trapped again as soon as one crosses back to the first screen. This is extremely annoying for anybody who uses an external monitor with his laptop and wants to make use of the extra desktop. 
The fix is trivial simply remove the usage of priv->minx and priv->miny and pass the default values to xf86InitValuatorAxisStruct as suggested in the Gentoo patch above. I have patched my synaptics driver V1.1.3 in this way and it works just fine now but perhaps you want to review the problem more thoroughly and find a solution that takes the automatically set priv->minx and priv->miny values into account without breaking the driver as it does at the moment.",122,"0"

Dmesg output from boot

Video output fails completely (apparently due to a KMS regression) on all kernels >= 3.2 rendering the system unusable as a desktop. Access via SSH over network is unaffected.

Steps to reproduce: Boot any recent kernel. This has been encountered with Debian and the kernel versions in question are:-

linux-image-3.0.0-2-amd64         3.0.0-5               functions as expected
linux-image-3.2.0-1-amd64         3.2.7-1               fails
linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64         3.2.13-1              fails
linux-image-3.3.0-trunk-amd64     3.3-1~experimental.1  fails


Expected behaviour:-

At system boot initial kernel output appears on the VGA console until the drm driver is loaded when the kernel switches the output font and resolution. Boot continues until a subsequent switch (I believe when the kernel attempts to modeswitch the card) at which point the font visibly changes at this point and boot continues with further console output until the X desktop appears.

Actual behaviour with failing kernels:-

Boot starts normally until the modeswitch happens at which point video output ceases and the monitor shows no signal on the DVI input.

[Problem]
After upgrading from lucid to maverick the laptop screen flickers similar to a CRT with a low refresh rate i.e. fast small changes in lightness especially visible in gradients. The flickering occurs independently from the chosen display resolution or brightness.

Other observations:
- when I connect an external display via VGA the flickering disappears on both displays
- gnome-display-properties lists the native resolution twice of which one additionally introduces a pattern of blurred vertical stripes

In the C headers generated by c-client.xsl there is no #ifdef __cplusplus / extern C wrapper. The wrapper is present in xcb/xcb.h and in headers generated by c_client.py. This means that C++ code that includes the generated headers needs to use extern C around the #include.

"TELEPATHY-36814","Tests for connection failures fail","If you change the server connection parameter from localhost to 127.0.0.1 all the tests pass. Alarm bells are ringing -- not *another* ipv6 buildbot problem!

The problem is that in a test like connect/connect-fail.py the server is listening on one port but the connection is tried on a completely different one. So idle is given localhost it resolves as two addresses (in this order in my testing): 127.0.0.1 and ::1.

Idle tries to connect to 127.0.0.1 on the wrong port -- failure this is good.
Idle now tries to connect to ::1 on the wrong port -- it just sits at trying to connect and as a result the test times out. 

So now there appear to be a few fixes possible:

 1. Make the buildbot stop advertising localhost as ::1.
 2. Give the buildbot a loopback ipv6 address.

These two are kind of rubbish as all stock /etc/hosts have localhost resolving to 127.0.0.1 and ::1 these days so no.

 3. Hard-code 127.0.0.1 in the test code instead of localhost so no resolving is done.
 4. Make idle timeout after 5 seconds or something for connections.

I can't think of a way of making idle be able to detect this crap.

Patch to fix a malformed error message

If you pay attention to the warnings during a build (using Ubuntu's gcc 4.2.3 at least) you can see the following:

dbus-marshal-recursive.c: In function 'writer_recurse_init_and_check':
dbus-marshal-recursive.c:1660: warning: too many arguments for format

Line dbus/dbus-marshal-recursive.c line 1660 has a large _dbus_warn_check_failed() statement which aims to combine two back-to-back string literals to make a format string.  Unfortunately there's a stray comma between the two literals so the second half of the message is treated as a parameter to be substituted into the first.  Fortunately the first parameter in the first literal is a %s so it won't do anything too evil but it certainly won't look right.

The attached patch (made against the 1.2.3 tarball) removes the extra comma causing the problem.  I haven't really tried to come up with a situation where the message would actually be printed but the fix is pretty obvious.",1,"0"

I realize this could be related to the upstream of amdgpu too but it's most likely a higher level issue than that.

The distro is current debian sid for months.

The issue was reliably reproducible when using Dolphin emulator on XWayland. At fullscreen it would freeze the rendering it would either stay frozen indefinitely or even if it would unfreeze it would only happen after exiting fullscreen. The issue goes away with a) Xorg b) rarely with specific backends only (e.g. Vulkan and not OpenGL).

The issue also goes away more easily c) when radeon module is used.

closed.  I have been asked to start a new bug report so here it is. 

Using Alt-F8 to switch from a virtual terminal back to an active X
session causes X to terminate.

My video chip is an 810e.  (Note the e.)

Machine:       Compaq 7587 (Pentium III 550 MHz 320 MB RAM)
Video chip:    i810e
Linux kernel:  Debian 2.4.27-3
x.org ver:     7.1.1
Resolution 1680x1050 16 bpp.
Video RAM allocated: 24000 kiB

(1) Started with startx -- -logverbose 9  date
    from virtual terminal 2.
(2) Graphics screen comes up fine everything works.
(3) Did an Alt+Ctrl+1 to switch to virtual terminal 1.
(4) X is still active (according to ps)
    X programs are still running fine (as evidenced by my network activity)
(5) Only when I try to switch back to X (with an Alt-F8) does something
    funny happen:

      (a) X instantly dies (I will attach a -logverbose 9 report).
          Because of the date command above I can confirm that the
          death is prompt.

      (b) The Alt-F8 switches me to virtual terminal 8 all right but
          it remains in text mode and all I see is a blank screen.

      (c) When I switch back to virtual terminal 2 I see the following
          output from X:

              Fatal server error:
              EnterVT failed for screen 0

Unlike some reports for bug 5795 a subsequent startx command has no
problem starting X again.

The newer driver from fairlite appears to have the same odd behavior.

855resolution/915resolution tricks.

I figure out the following:

Insert a new movie file   (stored on the PC at \userspace\myvideo\new.ogg)
Insert a second movie file (stored on a USB Drive \usbdrive\video\new1.avi)

Save your work and start presenation.
It works fine.

Now carry your work on a stick (or send it via email) to another PC. 
Open presentation.
There are no movies to watch. You'll see a great questionmark.

Ok. Although i thought i've insert the movies may they are just linked?
Next step:
Store the movie files byside the presentation on the stick and try again on the second PC.
Just as little as before it doesn't work.

You can see the movies just as they are stored in the same folder as on the first PC. But you never see a hint or question that this is the problem.

So i take a look in the content.xml of my presentation and i see this :

- 
 
I thing there should be a user - hint that media (movie) files are only linked to the document AND that it would be easyier to put them in the same folder with the presentation - before using it.

Much better it will be if impress dosen't find the linked content it looks out for it in the same folder along the stored pesentation file.
And if there isn't the required file then the questionmark is changed to a little text e.g.: the file \usbdrive\video\new1.avi is missing .

"CAIRO-84908","Compilation errors with MSVC after recent changes to 'cairo-path-stroke-traps.c'","Firstly apologies. I'm not sure whether this needs to get filed under 'general' or under 'win32-backend' but anyway here it is...

Since updating from git master about a week ago (ver 1.13.1) I can no longer compile 'cairo-path-stroke-traps.c' with Microsoft VC8. I get errors at lines 302 303 464 and 465. As an example line 302 looks like this:-

cairo_point_t t[] = { in->point *inpt *outpt }

Given that 'in->point' '*inpt' and '*outpt' are all structs I suspect the problem is that the compiler would need to generate a default copy c'tor for 'cairo_point_t'. MSVC does this when compiling as C++ but not when compiling as 'C'. Unfortunately if I change my project to build as C++ I just get a whole slew of other errors elsewhere. So currently I can't compile as 'C' nor as C++.

The errors at lines 302 and 303 can be fixed as follows. I'm not claiming that my fix is the most elegant one (and of course somebody will need to verify that it fulfils the original intention) but it does at least compile!! If somebody wants to come up with a more elegant solution this should at least tell them what's going wrong:-

1) Remove lines 302 and 303 and replace with the following code:-

cairo_point_t t[3]
cairo_point_t e[4]

memcpy( 
memcpy( 
memcpy( 

memcpy( 
memcpy( 
memcpy( 
memcpy( 

2) It looks like the same fix would probably work for lines 464 and 465.

"LIBREOFFICE-67056","PDF: Kerning issue with LIbreOffice 4 and Helvetica font","Created attachment 82625
document containing Helvetica

Problem description:
Export a document containing Helvetica font into PDF and the resulting PDF has horrible kerning--almost all spaces between words are removed making the PDF very difficult to read.

Steps to reproduce:
1. ....Open a document containing Helvetica font
2. ....Export to PDF

Current behavior:
Spaces between words are removed making it very difficult to read the PDF.

Expected behavior:
Space should remain constant so the document is readable (this works with LibreOffice 3.4.5).

"XORG-3369","RADEON doesn't unblank DPMS on shutdown","The Radeon chipset exhibits a strange behavior on shutdown: 
- When the DPMS registers were programmed such that the screen was blanked at 
  startup the screen remains blank after the server is shut down - no matter what   
  the state was while X was running.
- When the text console was not blank prior to the start of X but X was in a DPMS  
  power save mode when it was shut down the screen remains blank in console mode.

This exhibits two problems:
- Mode pragramming seems to be 'asymetric'
- DPMS powersave state isn't disabled during shutdown.

The patch that is going to be attached does two things:
1. It fixes the asymetry in register programming.
2. It disables any power save state prior to server shutdown regardless of the
   text console state.
The second step may be debateable as we don't restore DPMS to the state it was
in before X was started on the other hand a visible text console seems to be
what most people want.",0,"0"
"FONTCONFIG-101258","LONG_FAMILY_NAMES check still broken","Created attachment 131620
[PATCH] Fix testing PCF_CONFIG_OPTION_LONG_FAMILY_NAMES (CFLAGS need to be right)

The PCF_CONFIG_OPTION_LONG_FAMILY_NAMES check is still broken as of 2.12.3 as the check does not include the FREETYPE_CFLAGS and so is missing the includedir. 

The check fails because ft2build.h cannot be found.

The attached patch extends the LIBS/CFLAGS modification used to test the FreeType funcs and members to cover the test for the config flag.",1,"0"
"MESA-27962","BufferSwapComplete delivered when not selected for (direct rendering)","The X server implementation of GLX checks the drawables event mask before sending GLX_BufferSwapComplete events but when direct rendering we convert DRI2_BufferSwapComplete events into the GLX events and the DRI2 events are sent unconditionally. So application always receives events even when it hasn't asked for them.

This certainly violates the expectations of the extension spec and could confuse applications.

Probably DRI2EventToWire should silently consume the events without delivering them (this would mean saving the event mask client side.)",71,"0"
"XORG-30686","xf86-video-ati-6.13.2 scrambles 2560x1600 dual link DVI video on Radeon HD 4670","xf86-video-ati-6.13.2 scrambles 2560x1600 dual link DVI video on Radeon HD 4670.
xf86-video-ati from git as of 2010.10.07 also has this problem.
xf86-video-ati-6.13.1 is OK.

Sorry I do not have time to do a git bisect right now although I may try at some point if nobody beats me to it.  In the meantime I figure I should still report the bug now.

When I try to set dual link mode (2560x1600) in xf86-video-ati-6.13.2 or the git version as of 2010 Oct. 7 I get what appears to be a bad video signal.  Either the whole panel will display a rapidly changing or flickering image that looks somewhat similar to analog television static or the left side of the panel will display this and the right side of the panel will display a blurry image of the frame buffer that I can still use.

This problem occurs with user level mode setting.  With kernel mode setting the X server comes up solid black and the server log repeatedly says Timeout trying to update memory controller settings followed by You will probably crash now... but that too will be a separate bug report.  I mention it here just indicate the just run kernel mode setting is unlikely to work for users with a configuration like mine although I think that fixing the kernel mode setting issue and then saying just run kernel mode setting might be sufficient solution for other Linux users (although I am not sure about where that would leave users of other kernels such as *BSD).

---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-03-30 03:53:58 +0000 ----

The Synthesis engine now has support for storing unknown properties in its field list. It then can regenerate them when exporting again. This allows preserving arbitrary extensions while merging updates.

Use cases:
* CalDAV/CardDAV which explicitly requires this
* unknown local extensions (for example custom QContactDetails)

Need to use this feature. Also need a test which covers it.

Related to this problem is the lack of CtCap information for some SyncML servers for example Google. See https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15029.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-06-21 10:32:59 +0000 ----

Done by adding XPROPS to contacts.

For contacts it is tested as part of EDSGoogle Contacts sync which depends on this for preserving local extensions.

I consider this resolved for the time being. With calendar we don't have a data loss problem (less relevant extensions peers support them).

Steps to reproduce:
1. restart upowerd
2. wait until battery is critical: computer hibernates as expected.
3. charge computer (or start while connected to power)
4. wait until battery is fully charged (not sure if the battery needs to be fully charged to trigger )
5. unplug power
6. wait until battery is critical: computer does not hibernate!
7. charge and start computer: computer does not resume from hibernate!

Workarround: restart upowerd. I have now a systemd.timer which does this for me every hour to ensure not loosing any session-data when battery is critical.

Note: I have this issue on a gentoo-box (Thinkpad X1 2012-edition) with version upower-0.99.1-r1 (r1 means I have aplied the patches from bug https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82925)

"MESA-9062","tnl - full vertex buffers may cause additional primitives to be introduced","the hypertorus hack of xscreensaver (recent version may be needed - 4.24 should
be new enough I've used 5.0.1) shows some seemingly random triangles when
started with the right options (-solid -transparent should do). I've looked a
bit at it and it seems whenever a buffer wrap happens due to the buffer being
full (so _tnl_wrap_filled_vertex is called not sure if it's correct if
_tnl_wrap_buffers gets called due to other reasons) an additional tri will be
introduced (actually I think one is just drawn twice). This happens with both
software mesa and r200 though with r200 only when tcl_mode is either 1 or 0.
hypertorus uses GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP for all its rendering. I initially thought
there might be a bug because of the excessive glMaterial calls between
glBegin/glEnd but removing them completely (by replacing with enabling
GL_COLOR_MATERIAL) didn't change much except there were far fewer additional
triangles apparently because much less buffer wraps happen. Not sure but
_tnl_copy_vertices looked a bit strange to me for GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP as it may
copy 3 instead of only the last 2 vertices - apparently to avoid problems with
the vertex order but I'll wonder if that's related to this bug.

I can reproduce this with evince 2.28.2 or older newer evince has processing of different PDFs separated.

I tested this on Fedora you can have a look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=533992 for more info.

Hi all

I've been trying to get a evergreen adapter to work with the Radeon driver on a ppc64 machine. And while attempting that I'm running into what seems to be a infinite loop while running the IB test on ring 3.
I'm using a 3.8.0-rc4 kernel from today.

"MESA-96355","Performance: extra&costly SSBO validation even when SSBO aren't used","Hello

I'm currently trying to profile my application (PCSX2) with Mesa. I don't know if my GPU (GTX760) is properly reclocked but my app is often CPU limited. It could just be the IO operation that are very slow.

Anyway Perf-Event shows that nvc0_validate_buffers is (too) often called.
+    8.78%     7.98%  pcsx2_GSReplayL  nouveau_dri.so  nvc0_validate_buffers

My understanding of the code is that every time we switch a shader program a full SSBO bind/validation is called. nvc0_set_shader_buffers will dirty buffer state (NVC0_NEW_3D_BUFFERS). The trick is that my application doesn't use SSBO (only UBO). Is it expected to call SSBO validation code when the shader program doesn't use them? If not a validation shortcut will be nice.

"CCSS-22900","CCSS appears to believe all colours are invalid","Created attachment 27927
Fix colour parsing

In the version of libccss in git ccss_color_factory() calls ccss_property_init() which initialises c.base.state to CCSS_PROPERTY_STATE_INVALID after c.base.state has already been set by ccss_color_parse().

The effect of this is that all colour values have base.state==CCSS_PROPERTY_STATE_INVALID which in the case of background-color causes the background colour not to be drawn.  This can be seen in examples/example-2 the background colour should be yellow but no colour is drawn.

"DRI-45801","[SNB DP regression] no signal via DisplayPort since Linux  3.2","Created attachment 56766
Xorg.0.log under Linux v3.2

This regression was first reported as http://bugs.debian.org/658662

Since upgrading to Linux 3.2 an external display connected via DisplayPort to a Sandy Bridge onboard graphics card stopped working and instead turns off reporting “DP no signal”.

With Linux 3.1 the same display connected via the DisplayPort works fine. After powering both the display and the machine the display first turns on when the i915 kernel module is loaded upon boot. It shows the console with boot messages at the maximum display resolution (1920x1080). Then the X server starts and the external display switches to a lower resolution (1024x768) which seems to be the default setting of the X server. After login I manually switch to the maximum resolution (1920x1080) using the command “xrandr --output DP1 --auto”.

With Linux 3.2 after powering both the display and the machine the display remains dark during boot even when the i915 kernel module is loaded. The display first turns on only when the X server is loaded with the default resolution 1024x768. After login I manually switch to 1920x1080 but then the display reports “DP no signal” and turns *off*.

To summarize: The external display connected via DisplayPort works fine with Linux 3.1 while with Linux 3.2 it works with lower (non-native) resolutions and fails with the maximum (native) resolution.

I noticed one peculiarity: It is possible to have a working external display by booting into Linux 3.1 first and then rebooting into Linux 3.2 *without interrupting the power supply of the display*. However as soon as I power-cycle the display while under Linux 3.2 it stops working again.


There is a recent thread by Keith Packard with DisplayPort-related patches:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/25/204

I tested both a kernel with only PATCH 1/2 as well as a kernel with both PATCH 1/2 and 2/2 applied based on the Debian kernel source (linux-2.6_3.2.2-1) and using the Debian test-patches script. Both kernels showed the same faulty behaviour i.e. the external display remains dark at the native resolution.


Grepping for “display port” in the output of dmesg I noticed a difference in clock frequencies between Linux v3.1 and v3.2. If I assume correctly the three events correspond to the initial boot console (1920x1080) the loading
of X (1024x768) and the manual switch to maximum resolution using xrandr (1920x1080).

Am I missing some updated package here or am I experiencing some bug?

This is a flat panel and I'm quite sure it cannot accept modes above 85Hz maybe even lower. Furthermore according to the log there are lots of doublescan modes. When anything switches to 800x600 mode X picks a doublescan mode which won't work. If I manually do 'xrandr -s 800x600 -r 60' the mode is good.

Additionally the included X log contains a line like the following for every mode switch:

full backtrace in savageWriteRGBASpan_565()

The drawpix demo draws pixels spread around the screen instead of inside the window. Each line drawn (194 pixels) get displayed in a cluster but not as a line. Only every 6th line get displayed starting from the lower right of the screen going left then up (see drawpix-many.png).

The cluster is divided in 4 squares of 8 times 8 pixels where the first and fourth square is not complete. Each square is drawn from left to right then from top to bottom. Square are drawn from left to right within a cluster. (See drawpix-line.png).

I have tracked the drawing in mesa down to where it writes each pixel into the renderbuffer in savageWriteRGBASpan_565() see the full backtrace in write_rgba-backtrace.gdb.

This is with latest git. I think I have seen similar corruption using the antspotlight screensaver since a long time ago and I never tried drawpix before so this can be an old bug. The bug reporter of the downstream Ubuntu bug says drawpix worked fine in Ubuntu 8.04 which had mesa 7.0.3.",177,"1"

RFC patch on top of 34d59508 (drm/nouveau: fix TTM_PL_TT memtype on pre-nv50)

Commit 0a0afd28 (drm/nv50-/disp: move DP link training to core and
train from supervisor) removed a call to 'nouveau_dp_dpms' at the
bottom of nv50_display.c.

Without this call 'xset dpms force {onoff}' does not have any effect
on my DP-attached monitor.

The attached proof-of-concept patch re-adds the call as well as a partial
version of nouveau_dp_dpms which causes 'force off' to work again.

It is not clear to me how to trigger link training in the supervisor
so nouveau_dp_dpms skips that step when handling DRM_MODE_DPMS_ON.
The result is that 'force on' does not cause the monitor to wake up
and the connection is effectively dead.

Could somebody familiar with the driver could comment on the next
steps to undertake to restore the full {onoff} functionality?",153,"0"

"DEJAVU-97081","Condensed variants of DejaVu Sans and Serif no longer work","Last week my Debian system upgraded the DejaVu font packages from version 2.35-1 to 2.36-1. Afterwards I noticed that in LibreOffice any text using Dejavu Sans Condensed had become invisible as if it was white text on a white background (which it wasn't). The same applies to Dejavu Serif Condensed. All other fonts are working fine.

This might be a bug in LibreOffice which was upgraded at the same time. However I don't think that's the case because I tried to type some text in GIMP using both DejaVu Sans (Book) and DejaVu Sans Condensed and the latter didn't seem condensed at all. Instead both fonts looked identical. I also found out that in Mousepad's font selector window not only Sans Condensed but also its Oblique Bold and Bold Oblique variants appeared identical to Sans Book.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start LibreOffice Writer or Calc.
2. Select Dejavu Sans Condensed or Serif Condensed. Type some text.
3. What happens is that the cursor moves on the page but no text appears.

Build everything made the drm and nouveau module auto load at startup then changed my xorg.conf (attached).

But when restarting X the machine hang for quite a long time. It is not dead as I can ping it or event ssh to it. But you do not have any keyboard input (even caps lock led).

I then decided to be adventurous and try the 3D. And managed to install it. I now have some basic 3D acceleration except that if I magnify Glxgears it gets a sigsegv.

CONCLUSION
The bug was introduced and is lurking in the nouveau code of the official release 3.11.
The NVidia GT430 uses the nouveau driver so it is affected as described
by the subject bug.
Note:  There is a fix gpc hardware regression in the nouveau branch:
 a0b7ebfb39bf80078d12bd1a46ec40d0d0dbdeef
including some patches.
Apparently the corresponding mainline commit is
 d2989b534ef6834ebf2425aecc040b894b567c91
but it doesn't seem to affect (positively) the problem commit

test case for get GL and GLES2 renderer in one process

Currently I am doing some experiments with mesa to check the renderer info of underlying OpenGL and OpenGL ES2.0 drivers to decide which driver to use at runtime. With my code attached the renderer info for GLES2 can be got successfully and although the EGL and GLES2 libraries are unloaded before creating the GLX context glGetString(GL_RENDERER) for OpenGL still returns NULL. After enable MESA_DEBUG I found the error message GL User Error: calling GL function without a rendering context and many warnings as Mesa warning: failed to remap ..... I also changed the sequence for GL and GLES2 but got similar results. If do separately both renderer info can be got successfully.

And with the commit 16ee7a55ae269612263468195f2af998cb9ef695 the problem is still there.",77,"0"

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52875","config migration + auto sync: duplicates configs","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-19 09:21:27 +0000 ----

SyncEvolution 1.1.99.6

* create a config with SyncEvolution < 1.1.99 which has auto syncing enabled
* run syncevo-dbus-server 1.1.99.6
* restart after one auto sync

What happens is this:
1. the server sees the config
2. it starts an auto config
3. it migrates the config which keeps the old config around with an .old suffix
4. restart
5. the server sees the .old config
6. repeat at step 2 ad infinitum
=> creates config .old .old.old .old.old.old ...

There are two options:
- ignore old configs for auto-syncing
- disabled auto-syncing in them

I prefer the second option because old configs are only implicitly marked as such via the config name.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-08-19 13:04:09 +0000 ----

Same problem also occurred for configs which had auto-syncing disabled and no syncURL set (server configs) because the per-transport-kind check was flawed.

commit a8effb21b8ad5d726829911046bf1c23380e2551
Author: Patrick Ohly 
Date:   Fri Aug 19 16:19:12 2011 +0200

    config migration: avoid name conflicts and auto syncing of old configs (BMC #22691)
    
    When (auto-)migrating a config it was possible that a name for the
    peer say foo.old was chosen for the renamed config although there
    was already such a config for example foo.old in ~/.sync4j. Besides
    being confusing for users this also led to a bug in the code where it
    copied from the older config with the foo.old name.
    
    Found when adding unit testing of migrating configs with auto syncing
    because then the content of the migrated config mattered.
    
    The main problem fixed in this commit is the disabling of auto syncing
    in the old config. Done similar to ConsumerRead by reading/writing
    the .ini (resp. .txt) file directly.

Date:   Fri Aug 19 15:08:14 2011 +0200

    auto syncing: must check whether enabled when looking at unknown URLs (part of BMC #22691)
    
    syncURL = insert your URL here with autoSync = 0 did lead to auto
    sync attempts although it wasn't enabled. A check for auto syncing
    enabled was missing for the unknown transport case.

In Doomsday (3D Doom/Heretic/Hexen source port with many enhancements) the sky
looks like a hall of mirrors. Screenshot: http://darka.liero.be/skyhom.jpg

Apparently the OpenGL specification says:
The Color command has two major variants: Color3 and Color4. The four value
versions set all four values. The three value versions set R G and B to the
provided values A is set to 1.0.
It seems it's not exactly like that in Mesa.

Hope you can help no one is going to maintain mplayer-vaapi anymore and there is no hope for mplayer2-vaapi. I also tried vlc with vaapi but it sucks hards (it stutter you just can't watch a video with vlc and vaapi).

commit d6b7f96fde1add92fd11f5a75869ae6fc688bf77
Author: Chris Wilson 
Date:   Sat Mar 6 15:49:04 2010 +0000

    Fill alpha on xrgb images.
    
    Do not try to fixup the alpha in the ff/shaders as this has the
    side-effect of overriding the alpha value of the border color causing
    images to be padded with black rather than transparent. This can
    generate large and obnoxious visual artefacts.
    
    Fixes:
    
      Bug 17933 - x8r8g8b8 doesn't sample alpha=0 outside surface bounds
      http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17933
    
    and many related cairo test suite failures.

Side note: is there a test suite I can run? I usually use latest git master daily but I guess I could give you a more scientific hand if I run test suites also.",52,"0"

"POLICYKIT-105865","Port JavaScript authority to mozjs52","Currently polkit depends on mozjs24 to provide the JavaScript
support for the JavaScript authority.  The problem is mozjs24
is quite old at this point.  Most other parts of the desktop
have moved on.

This patchset updates polkit to target mozjs52 instead.

As a side benefit we can re-enable the JIT since it no longer
seems to conflict with the watchdog thread used to detect when
a javascript script is caught in an infinite loop.",0,"0"
"LIBREOFFICE-62267","Conditional formatting lost after paste special of text numbers and dates.","If you have a cell with conditional formatting and you use paste special only inserting only text numbers and dates the formatting is lost. Undo do not recover the conditional formatting.

What happening:
The conditional formatting lost.

Expected:
Conditional formatting should be untouched. Also an undo should bring back the conditional formatting.

To me it looks like two bad things are happening at the same time: Loosing the conditional formatting and second that it cannot be undone. So that's the reason I have assigned severity major

temporary patch to solve this issue

libinput SRCREV = 56b5f846ac7f8243da4ba2f288654becf1014c46

issue:
   Weston will crash when plugin a mouse device.

precondition:
   Define LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX in udev rules

crash point:
   crash happens in function evdev_device_calibrate() when calculate x/y scaler: 
   
   sx = device->abs.absinfo_x->maximum - device->abs.absinfo_x->minimum + 1
   sy = device->abs.absinfo_y->maximum - device->abs.absinfo_y->minimum + 1

   inside this calculation maybe the absinfo_x/y is nil then the access to maximum & minimum value will aborted.

   even it is caused by the driver i thin libinput need to focus this case.

became less & less. I assumed something like incompatability between laptop &

Recently I could not get it to work and someone suggested that I set the laptop
as dual head ... I then got another desktop displayed by the projector but
different from the one on the laptop screen. This shows me that there is no
incompatibility. What I want it to have the same desktop & applications
displayed on both - so that the audience can see what I am seeing.

Intel 865G just shows no video on the VT.

The patch closing Bug #63310 (git commit 7cfebce15228c88ee122edb8ba575f9a609e36f4) appears to be broken on platforms that use filename extensions for linked executables. As of cairo-1.14.0 the strings test hardcodes the AC_LINK_IFELSE executable name as conftest which is correct for linux and osx but mingw it would be conftest.exe instead. Using conftest$ac_exeext is probably the platform-independent way of getting it correct.

Please look at attached screenshot - there is triangle where we still see part of old frame that was displayed on screen few frames before. I doesn't sure about terminology but from my point of view looks like rendering in this triangle is lag behind rest of the screen.
This issue happen for me only for applications launched with enabled offloading rendering (DRI_PRIME=1). It's reproducible not only in Left 4 Dead 2 but also in other applications. Even in Chromium (if you launch it with --ignore-gpu-blacklist option that enabled hardware rendering on Mesa and DRI_PRIME=1 that enable offloading rendering) display same artifact (triangle) while scrolling pages. Also you may notice this artifact in glxgears if you you run it in fullscreen mode.

"FONTCONFIG-3453","fc-lang crashes when compiled and executed under MinGW/MSYS","Hi

the tool lc-lang crashes when it was compiled using MSYS (msysdvlpr). MSYS is a
*nix like environment for MinGW.

The problem is that the size allocated for all variables on the stack exceeds a
stack page. The trivial fix is to make the variable storage static.

"DRI-90836","Ksnapshot (KDE) broken when using xf86-video-intel-2.99.916 + DRI3","Ksnapshot (version 4.14.1 or higher) stopped working when using xf86-video-intel-2.99.916 while 3d acceleration is enabled in the KDE window-manager (kwin).

This happens at least on openSUSE 13.2 and Fedora 22.


Ksnapshot is a tool for taking screenshots. When used in the described environment Ksnapshot captures itself instead of the rest of the desktop. This doesn't happens when DRI3 is turned of or window-manager (kwin) 3d acceleration is turned of.

"XORG-22229","Incorrect PLL values selected for RS690","I have had some problems with flickering using this chip and high resolution displays over DVI/HDMI. The problem seems dependent on the model of screen some seem more sensitive to variations in pixel clock than others. I have managed to resolve the issue by making 2 changes to radeon_crtc.c one to enable the use of the fractional fb divider and secondly by changing the selection criteria for PLL values to choose the closest frequency that is less than the target frequency rather than just the closest. I have added these changes unconditionally to the driver (it's basically a quick hack to make it work and certainly could be much tidier) but can post a patch if required.

I don't have access to any other radeon cards so I can't say if this problem or the solution affects them - I suspect from the looking at the commit logs that the fractional fb div doesn't work on some cards but it seems to be required for the RS690. 

Any advice on how/where to properly incorporate these changes into the driver would be appreciated.",0,"0"

TrueType font file

Greetings
    I'm using LibreOffice 4.1.4.2 from the backports repository of Debian Linux 7 with some thousand files in my ~/.font directory which keeps growing up as I'm collecting fonts since a long time ago. It was possible to isolate via strace a segmentation fault in libvcllo.so which prevented LibreOffice from starting at all. Removing from ~/.fonts just a couple of fonts (one is attached here they seem to belong to the same family) allowed LibreOffice to start flawlessly again. Opening the fonts with gnome-font-viewer allowed to see they're made only of numeric digits and some symbol which is not expected to cause a segmentation fault anyway. It must be something in the file structure.

    I'm unsure about the weakness creating this problem apparently due to some poor handling of bad/unexpected data. If it's located in lower level components used by libvcllo.so then I shall move the problem to the Debian maintaners for sure.

    If however it is due to LibreOffice itself solving this problem might even close unconfirmed/unreproduceable situations sharing the same cause which seems an opportunity too important to ignore. Is anyone capable/willing to test this with other versions of LibreOffice and/or Linux? The test isn't supposed to corrupt your system if the behavior is the same I experienced then it will be sufficient to remove the offending font to get LibreOffice running again. Thanks.

Horizontal ruler

Hello

This was an issue which I have never paid much attention before but today realised that it was all wrong. 

Numbering on the horizontal ruler is wrong and numbers are not aligned with the gaps-intervals-spaces. 

Let's see:

Horizontal ruler has 18 intervals in total. This is also indicated on the ruler. But when we count the numbering and the intervals we only get 16 because numbers are not aligned with the ruler. 

Well we can solve it like this I guess numbering should be aligned and it should end at 16 instead 18.

3. Press F7 to start spell checking
4. Arrow around in the text widget displaying the error (Not in Dictionary)
5. Insert and delete text in the widget displaying the error

Expected results:
1. After step 3 the tree printed out would include an accessible object implementing AtkText which displays the error.
2. When steps 4 and 5 are performed accessible events would appear in the terminal

Actual results: Neither of the above happen. In particular:

[snip]

"DBUS-98157","format string vulnerability processing ActivationFailure messages","While trying to fix all the compiler warnings (Bug #97357) I tried enabling -Wsuggest-attribute=format and found this:

---

dbus-daemon listens for ActivationFailure signals coming from systemd. When running with --systemd-activation these signals are used to report that systemd could not activate a D-Bus service for us when not using --systemd-activation they are still processed.

dbus-daemon passes the human-readable message contained in these signals to dbus_set_error() where a format string is expected. In principle this could lead to arbitrary memory overwrite via a format string attack in the message received from systemd resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    
I believe this is not an exploitable security vulnerability on the system bus in practice: it can only be exploited by the owner of the org.freedesktop.systemd1 bus name which is restricted to uid 0 so if systemd is attacker-controlled then the system is already doomed. Similarly if a systemd system unit mentioned in the activation failure message has an attacker-controlled name then the attacker likely already has sufficient access to execute arbitrary code as root in any case.
    
However prior to dbus 1.8.16 and 1.9.10 due to a missing check for systemd's identity unprivileged processes could forge activation failure messages which would have gone through this code path. We thought at the time that this was a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2015-0245) this bug means that it was in fact potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

If you just looked at the COPYING file (like I did) you'd come away with the impression that you can't use D-Bus from a GPL version 3 program since neither of those licenses is GPLv3-compatible.

Suggested fix: append or later to that sentence.

The KEY_ZOOMIN / KEY_ZOOMOUT linux input events have the keycodes 0x1a2 and 0x1a3 resp. I'd guess that the crash happens because of the high keycode used as array index in GetKeyboardValuatorEvents() without range check.

Xorg log file with nearly 30k lines of repeated messages stripped

Direct symptoms:
- display left unattended with xscreensaver in simple blank mode
- DPMS disabled (checked both with xset and xscreensaver-demo)
- when coming back to my keyboard the monitor does not get a video signal
- I can still login remotely through ssh and reboot the machine properly

Hardware is an Asus M4A88TD-V EVO/USB3 motherboard featuring radeon HD4250 (RS780).  OS is uptodate Debian/testing.

syslog contains lines like the following.  In this case although I was not here it may be that someone tried to use the box.  In the 2 other occurences I have traces for it I may even have been myself but I did not dig at that time.

However although the Xorg.0.log error lines are not timestamped the file timestamp itself matches the box' reboot.  Since there are ~15000 occurences of the error X may have been experiencing them since the error reported by the drm module.  I can try to get more detailed facts next time (unless unnecessary just tell).

xorg server log

I recently changed my graphics card from a Radeon HD 6670 to a Radeon R7 260X.

With this change some KDE3/Qt3 software I still use became partly unusable because of extremely slow rendering of their tree view widgets - the email folder list in Kmail 1.9.10 folder/project view in Quanta plus (and Quanta isn't replacable there's no Qt4 version) ... and it's neither user nor window manager specific. Tried different users and several window managers / desktop environments to run the programs.

Example lags for Kmail: it takes about 35 seconds until the content of a a newly chosen email folder shows up. 10 seconds to fold 40 seconds to unfold a folder with its subfolders.

The problem vanishes if I use the framebuffer driver with X.org. Everything works fine then - though at generally lower speed of course.

The most apparent change that came along with the change of the graphics card is the change in 2D acceleration architecture. The HD 6670 was using EXA the R7 260X is using glamor - and unfortunately I can not switch back to EXA with this card. So I suppose glamor is the component that is causing this trouble.

Test 11 Water - the water has a yellowish tint possibly because of the refraction issue?

1. Open attached file qwedasr.ods (this file was sent me by another man) 
2. choose second row val and aplay standart filter (Data -> Filter -> Standart Filter) by setting [val < -500]. Note that it takes about few seconds (on my system it's about 3 seconds [amd phenom II X4 955 (3.2 GHz) 4GB ram]).
3. Now (or you can do it first instead of item 2 of descrition) select the same row val and aplay standart filter (Data -> Filter -> Standart Filter) by setting [val > -100]. Note that time of filtering takes few second again (on my system it's about 7-10 sec.).

Such time results are very strange as in OpenOffice-3.2.1 and -3.3.0 such filtering works instantly.

This can be overcome with setting Option Tiling false so I think it is really related to Tiling.

System environment:
-- chipset: 945G
-- system architecture: 32bit
-- xf86-video-intel: 2.8.1 but it is the same since 2.7.9
-- xserver: 1.6.3.901 but the same in 1.6* at least.
-- mesa: 7.5
-- libdrm: 2.4.12
-- kernel: 2.6.30-gentoo-r4 but also with 2.6.29* and latest git sources
-- Linux distribution: gentoo
-- Machine or mobo model: desktop
-- Display connector: vga

Reproducing steps:
- Install pymol [1]
- fetch 3cwg
- wait a second

"XORG-14373","xkb: Alternative layouts don't work due to groups invented by the server","The following configuration doesn't work with xorg-1.4.0.90:

Section InputDevice
    Identifier  Keyboard
    Driver      kbd
    Option      AutoRepeat    250 30

    Option XkbModel pc105
    Option XkbLayout dede(nodeadkeys)
    Option XkbOptions grp:caps_toggle
EndSection

Symptons:
When you press the a key you get an a when switched to one group but an æ when switched to the other group. Most other keys are broken too. The reason is that for all keys where the 2 layouts have identical mappings and which therefore should contain only 1 group (xkbcomp optimizes away identical groups) the server invents a 2nd group that contains the last 2 symbols from group1.

Example: Here is the symbol mapping of the a key as reported by xkbcomp :0 - after starting the server with the above configuration.

key  {
 type[group1]= FOUR_LEVEL_ALPHABETIC
  symbols[Group1]= [  a  A  ae AE ]
  symbols[Group2]= [  ae AE ]
 }

And here is how it should be

key  {
  type= FOUR_LEVEL_ALPHABETIC
  symbols[Group1]= [  a   A  ae   AE ]
 }

And this is indeed what you get when you issue the command 

setxkbmap -layout dede(nodeadkeys)

after the server has started. Why is this different? The 2 should be the same shouldn't they?

Unfortunately due to bug #14359 putting the setxkbmap command into .xinitrc can not be used as a workaround.",234,"1"

discard hang testcase

The attached program will render to the screen using this pixel shader:

void main()
{
    discard
}

This actually causes a momentary hang complete with this in dmesg:

[  168.980106] Skipping EDID probe due to cached edid
[  171.832558] [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
[  171.832700] [drm:i915_do_wait_request] *ERROR* i915_do_wait_request returns -5 (awaiting 2230 at 2227)

The system recovers though. This is on Ubuntu Maverick. It also affects the master branch of mesa.

I have the program set up to render one frame wait ten seconds then quit. That way you don't have a hard time killing it like you would if it were rendering this shader in a loop.

If I do run it in a loop I get these messages:

In the INSTALL file there is nothing to explain WHAT values GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS
should be set to or HOW to set those flags.

Here is a question:
If users know SO MUCH about terminal configuration shells and installs 
how come they are just NOW downloading GTK?

I have a MacBook OSX 10.4 Dual Intel Core

So maybe you could just tell me how to get C++ to talk to X11.
Then I can give up on GTK.

"XORG-38539","AMD Radeon 6950 (Cayman): Short freezes with KDE","Created attachment 48252
dmesg output

Since I upgraded from a Radeon HD4870 to a 6950 I'm getting frequent short freezes of up to maybe 5-6 seconds when KDE draws (new? large?) surfaces e.g. when a new application opens or when switching desktops with effects enabled. I haven't encountered the freezes without acceleration yet.

What happens is that sometimes the system seems to stop entirely but it really seems to be limited to the X server. The image is frozen the mouse pointer does not move and the system does not react to e.g. the numlock key. Additionally sometimes when it happens when clicking the mouse (e.g. when trying to get a partially covered window to the foreground) the system seems to miss the button-up event and handles mouse movements after recovery like dragging.

However mplayer in the background continues playing without even a hitch.

There are no messages related to this in dmesg syslog Xorg.log or .xsession-errors. I'm attaching dmesg and Xorg.0.log anyway.

hi
  I vote for adding embeddedbitmap option to official fontconfig.
  Several distros have shiped patched version of fontconfig which adds
an option like rh_prefer_bitmap or embeddedbitmap. Because we need a way
to explictly tell Xft/Cairo to load bitmaps embedded in fonts or not.
And for cairo if i want to cairo transform a font to pretend as an
oblique one and when i disable antialias for the font then cairo will
always load embedded bitmaps if available latter cairo(exactly to say
it's freetype) will be unable to transform the font glyphs because they
are bitmaps. If option embeddedbitmap is available we can tell freetype
to load outlines rather than embedded bitmaps by set embeddedbitmap to
false and then can transform font glyphs as expected. Xft is smart
enough in this case it add FC_LOAD_NO_BITMAP to load flags when loading
glyphs. But that is not easily to implement in cairo because cairo
doesn't handle FC_MATRIX itself.",132,"0"

We should really fix this properly.  However the pitfall has existed

Upstream MythTV indicated that this is actually a bug in mesa. Quoting on MythTV #4206: http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/4603

For anyone keeping score at home various myth threads open and close the display for local queries. Inside X11 this eventually works its way down to dri_glx.c::OpenDriver? which dlopen's the correct .so on the first call. Subsequent calls get the handle from that initial dlopen.

Unfortunately this doesn't increment the reference count for the .so and a dlclose at the first nested XOpenDisplay/XCloseDisplay (like in libmythtv's get_glx_version) causes the dri library to be unloaded and soon after that MythTV go boom. The unload message in the initial report turned out to be the key something I realized moments after submitting the bug.

The quick fix and this is Linux-specific is to tweak the inital search at the top of OpenDriver? in mesa's dri_glx.c.

    drm/i915: Fix up the vma aliasing ppgtt binding

    Currently we have the problem that the decision whether ptes need to
    be (re)written is splattered all over the codebase. Move all that into
    i915_vma_bind. This needs a few changes:
    - Just reuse the PIN_* flags for i915_vma_bind and do the conversion
      to vma->bound in there to avoid duplicating the conversion code all
      over.
    - We need to make binding for EXECBUF (i.e. pick aliasing ppgtt if
      around) explicit add PIN_USER for that.
    - Two callers want to update ptes give them a PIN_UPDATE for that.

    Of course we still want to avoid double-binding but that should be
    taken care of:
    - A ppgtt vma will only ever see PIN_USER so no issue with
      double-binding.
    - A ggtt vma with aliasing ppgtt needs both types of binding and we
      track that properly now.
    - A ggtt vma without aliasing ppgtt could be bound twice. In the
      lower-level ->bind_vma functions hence unconditionally set
      GLOBAL_BIND when writing the ggtt ptes.

    There's still a bit room for cleanup but that's for follow-up
    patches.

    v2: Fixup fumbles.

    v3: s/PIN_EXECBUF/PIN_USER/ for clearer meaning suggested by Chris.

It is indeed pointless: GObject upstream don't consider appending to a GInterface vtable struct (the ones that start with a GTypeInterface) to be an incompatible change.

wjt's branch fixes AccountStorage a recently-merged branch fixes DispatchOperationPolicy and the branch in the URL field here fixes the remaining implemented-by-plugins classes so far namely RequestPolicy and DBusAcl. It also improves some documentation.",0,"0"

The problem seems to be that the monitor's EDID output describes a 135 MHz pixel

can't actually cope with that signal.  Forcing it down to 60 Hz appears to make

I have only tried with Mesa 7.8. Source code references below are against Mesa 7.8.2.

*** Description of the problem ***

Running under valgrind a program that does a glDrawArrays call using a GL_RGB8 texture I get this error:

==14218== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

==14218==    at 0x211699D8: fetch_texel (prog_execute.c:373)

Stepping in GDB through fetch_texel() I arrive at this location:
   opt_sample_rgb_2d at swrast/s_texfilter.c:1366

The code there does:

   for (k=0 k<n k++) {
      GLint i = IFLOOR(texcoords[k][0] * width) 
      GLint j = IFLOOR(texcoords[k][1] * height) 
      GLint pos = (j << shift) | i
      GLubyte *texel = ((GLubyte *) img->Data) + 3*pos
      rgba[k][RCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[2])
      rgba[k][GCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[1])
      rgba[k][BCOMP] = UBYTE_TO_FLOAT(texel[0])
   }

It seems that it's leaving the alpha channel uninitialized.

When we look at the location of the first reported valgrind error using that
uninitialized value _mesa_convert_colors (image.c:5421) the source code is:


   case GL_FLOAT:
      if (dstType == GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE) {
         const GLfloat (*src4)[4] = (const GLfloat (*)[4]) src
         GLubyte (*dst1)[4] = (GLubyte (*)[4]) (useTemp ? tempBuffer : dst)
         GLuint i
         for (i = 0 i < count i++) {
            if (!mask || mask[i]) {
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][RCOMP] src4[i][RCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][GCOMP] src4[i][GCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][BCOMP] src4[i][BCOMP])
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][ACOMP] src4[i][ACOMP])
            }
         }
         if (useTemp)
            memcpy(dst tempBuffer count * 4 * sizeof(GLubyte))
      }


The error line 5421 is the one converting the alpha channel:
               UNCLAMPED_FLOAT_TO_UBYTE(dst1[i][ACOMP] src4[i][ACOMP])

This confirms the theory that the valgrind error is caused by the alpha value here being uninitialized.",0,"0"

"PORTLAND-40041","Thunderbird 5 needs unescaped addresses","Created attachment 50158
proposed patch

Thunderbird 5 (and probably also TB 3) expects unescaped strings passed for To: Cc: and BCc: fields. With the current xdg-email version Thunderbird uses escaped strings as addresses. This is not true for Subject and Body fields where strings are properly unescaped by TB itself. Truly inconsistent behaviour.

The attached patch unescapes address fields back to plain text. I don't think this is the cleanest solution but it's not intrusive at least. Proper way could be to pass original strings directly (saving them aside when parsing commandline args) but the script architecture would need to be altered.

Current behaviour:

I have no tool to TEST the API to ensure is 'passing' once it compiles 
completely. Everything compiles completely and I even get a package - yet we 
still see segmentation faults:

  The core dump is caused by setting a function pointer to null then calling 
it. The function is null because there is in no corresponding action for the 
format_code. The format codes are defined with macro PICT_FORMAT but there is 
none for the active parameters. The parameters are generated from the source 
visual and are set in cairo-xlib-surface.c lines 531+. The visual is generated 
by libgdk so we can't tell why the visual has the values it does. We can only 
say that cairo is not prepared for it and dumps core.

Cairo exports font names in their original form. But these can be wrong they can sometimes contain white space characters or PDF/PostScript delimiter characters. Such fonts are not common but they appear.

This can cause a problem when you are printing such file in evince. The printing fails during processing of an intermediate PDF because there are delimiter characters where they shouldn't be.

Attached patch escapes PostScript names of fonts (ps_name variable) right after these are loaded. It was already case for TrueType and OpenType fonts but not for pure CFF fonts. Type1 fonts were just shortened to the last correct character.

patch against black screen problem against kernel 2.6.36

As a kernel upgrade 2.6.36.1 arrived for the arch linux repositories.
As soon as i915 enters KMS my laptop(HP proBook 5320m) screen stays black not even backlight.

I bisect the problem to this commit:

1. The top-panel bar is absent.

2. Window shadows are white rather than black (or at least I presume they're meant to be shadows and not a glow!)",1379,"1"
"XORG-13872","TV-Out show bright white colors as black/white noise","Hello

when using the tv-out of my VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10] it works quite good (much better than the previously used VGAComposite adapter). This is true apart from a strange distortion.

Some white very bright areas show garbage - it looks like static you get when no station is tuned in. I tried to take a picture that I attached to this report - it's not too good but I put strokes around the relevant areas. The noise I describe is visible at the top of the buttons.

Greetings

"LIBREOFFICE-46816","UI: Incorrect error message with Insert Names Define","Hello

Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new spreadsheet (same with an existing one)
2. Insert> Names> Define

Current behaviour: Open dialog with the error message Invalid name. Only use letters numbers and underscore

Expected behavior Open Dialog  with :
- Display Define the name and range or formula expression.
- Add button disabled / Cancel button enabled 

On open of the dialog disable the Add button is enough to avoid empty names. So :
- Enable Add button  when the name is correct
- Disable the Add button and display the message Invalid name. Only use letters numbers and underscore only when wrong character used.

Display an error message before any user intervention is to me an error in the ergonomics of this feature.

I find that unfortunate considering all the improvements cf.

contains everything to reproduce bug in simplest way

If xkb_keymap_new_from_file is called from Java via a JNI library then it crashes. When called from a native application that links to the exact same JNI library the function works perfectly.

Attached is a zip file that demonstrates in the simplest way possible the crash from Java and it working fine called via the JNI library linked by a native application.

To Build:
    - extract zip
    - cd xkbbug
    - edit build.sh JDK variable to point to where your JDK is.
    - sh ./build.sh

To Run from java:
    - sh ./run-from-java.sh

To Run native app that calls same code:
    - sh ./run-native.sh

I've also included prebuilt binaries for 64 bit Linux so you don't need to manually build. When run from Java you will see that it core dumps when trying to load the keyboard file.",1,"0"

"UPOWER-102903","upower-0.99.4 to .99.6 crash (segfault) with cgroups v2","Hi

I’m running upower on a 64bit glibc Gentoo hardened system. Recently the daemon manager OpenRC introduced support for cgroupv2. Using that leads
to segfaults.

Quote from OpenRC’s config file (/etc/rc.conf):
# This sets the mode used to mount cgroups.
# hybrid mounts cgroups version 2 on /sys/fs/cgroup/unified and
# cgroups version 1 on /sys/fs/cgroup.
# legacy mounts cgroups version 1 on /sys/fs/cgroup
# unified mounts cgroups version 2 on /sys/fs/cgroup
rc_cgroup_mode=unified

The actual message in dmesg:
upowerd[7932]: segfault at 8 ip 00005c922042de88 sp 00007fffbc5d2b50 error 4 in upowerd[5c9220408000+3e000]

bugb.pc:

Running that leads to:

So versioned dependencies not detected while:
---
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=. pkg-config --cflags buga echo $?
Package 'buga' requires 'bugb >= 42' but version of bugb is 1
1


Is that only about versioned dependencies? No. Tweak the Requires line of buga.pc so that it looks like that instead:
---
Name: buga
Description: Bug testcase A
Version: 1
Requires: bugc


And now running autoreconf -vfi && ./configure again leads to the same issue as before.

Wild guess that macro uses --exists which works but then --cflags and --libs fail. And tada pkg.m4 agrees pkg-config is called with: --exists --print-errors and dependencies aren't checked.",7,"0"

So this looks like a new thing therefore I file a new bug. Feel free to re-open and duplicate to the old ones. 

I have checked dmesgs from surrounding runs where we don't hit the issues but there is no other splat before so this looks more sporadic than the previous ones.

A small description of what I would like to contribute:

o First I believe there should exist some trial time so I
  don't want to do this at first but I want to work on some
  of the work already in place in X Org tree to actually
  use the _X_EXPORT macro and I already have it working
  for a distribution using X Server 1.4 and latest version
  of all other packages.
o I would also like to work on having a stable API/ABI among
  releases to help on easier updates and adoption of new
  features.
o To start probably it would be better to work on something
  non vital. I revived some code in xedit made it usable
  again and among this I made a tags interface that I have
  been using to quickly find symbol definitions in the X Org
  tree.
o Xorgcfg is a program I wrote from start and I would like
  to make if functional again.

  I have been away from X development for some time and
besides I am currently working on a mirror of freedesktop
git repositories I would like to have some supervision/help
for any initial work as I have only around 2 month of
experience using git already know how to work with branches

NetworkManager kind of depends on HAL to send device-removal signals when a
device gets removed and if HAL doesn't do that weird stuff happens like the
3G card still showing up in the applet menu even though it's been pulled out
becuase HAL didn't send the removal signal for the tty and thus NM doesn't
think the device has been removed.

But the ttys actually *are* removed because they aren't in the device list (checked with lshal) after the card has been pulled.  So the removal signal for the tty seems to be getting dropped on the floor.",37,"0"

The i915_vbt debugfs dump

After fixing the PWM backlight of this LPSS system (bug 96571) I get a black screen once I load the i915 module. Before it (efi fb) it displays fine.

I'm using Shobhit patches for enabling the PWM plus another one in the referred bug over 4.5 and 4.6.3 with the same outcome: backlight works great the pixels get all black after a quick flicker at module loading.

I notice from the drm debugfs that the lcd panel is connected with DSI. The LCD panel acording to the BIOS setting for MIPI panel is an Innolux 8x12 (10.1 800x1280) like this:

This is needlessly pedantic. If we had instead said that the CM must
ignore interfaces which aren't supported on the Contacts interface then
client code that does care could still check ContactAttributeInterfaces
to distinguish those two cases and client code that doesn't care
wouldn't have to mess around checking the list of interfaces it passes

It is possible that I will see some significant render speed improvements in Blender3d if I can persuade it to talk to my GPU.  On the other hand I am on a laptop with not a great GPU so all this effort might be fruitless but I thought I would give it a try...

So I installed Beignet ran Blender with OpenCL support enabled selected GPU computation hit render... and it very quickly crashed with a dump to the command line that looked like this :

See original bug report for description.
This issue has not been fixed there.

There are 2 workaround however it is difficult to deal with ordinary activities.
This is a serious bug since data is lost.

So hopefully it can be resolved in LibreOffice.
Could you please check on this issue?",583,"1"

"XORG-16522","Add configure option to set NOFONTSERVERACCESS (patch included)","Created attachment 17378
Add configure option --disable-fc which disables font server support

In libXfont-1.3.1 there is the configure option --disable-fc which disables the code to connect to a font server. In xorg-server-1.4.2 in confdefs.h there is the #define NOFONTSERVERACCESS but the only way to set it is by passing --enable-builtin-fonts to configure.

I think it can be useful to compile an X server which only supports client-side fonts but does not have them built into the server itself. Therefore I would like to have a configure option to set the NOFONTSERVERACCESS #define.

I attached a patch that adds the --disable-fc configure option which sets NOFONTSERVERACCESS. It required adding one #ifndef in dix/dixfonts.c all other changes are in configure.ac.

The existing --enable-builtin-fonts option implies --disable-fc. This is handled by giving the fc option the default value auto which acts as enabled. If --enable-builtin-fonts is given a warning is printed and fc is forcibly disabled.

An alternative would be to silently disable fc if it was in auto mode and raise an error if it was in enabled mode (explicitly enabled by the user). I usually prefer programs to refuse invalid inputs instead of automatically correcting them. However I looked for similar situations in configure.ac and saw that for example --disable-dga is handled by printing a warning and forced disabling so I conformed to that.",808,"1"
"LIBREOFFICE-49986","EDITING: EDITING: Display refresh not working properly after deletion of text","Created attachment 61705
Screenshot showing new text inserted on the second line causing the word 'making' to be partially displayed on its original line instead of being wrapped to the next line.

Problem description:
When editing text insertion or deletion often does not correctly refresh the display until I force a refresh (by scrolling the window for example) or until what appears to be a built-in timer initiates a refresh after a number of seconds which I have not been able to time. (The only timer I can identify is in Options/Load Save/General/Save AutoRecovery Information which is set to 15 minutes).

Garbage remains on the affected line to the right of the insertion/deletion point. Often the remaining text is truncated so the first character of the spurious part is only partly displayed.

This bug was posted to Linux Questions and at least one other user on a different platform has noticed the same problem. See http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=4679493#post4679493

In Options/LibreOffice/View I am using Hardware Acceleration and AntiAliasing - that is the way LibreOffice was configured at installation time and I have not changed anything.

Under Fedora 14 using Compiz I had identical display refresh errors when editing an OpenOffice Writer document. The fix then was to edit the Compiz settings to enable the module 'Workarounds'. I cannot find any equivalent option with my current system.

I do not have display rendering issues with any other application.


Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a paragraph of text.
2. Delete or insert some text.
3. Observe the remaining text to the right.

Current behavior:
Text to the right of the insertion/deletion point is not correctly refreshed on screen.

Expected behavior:
The display should refresh to correctly show the state of the remaining text.

"CAIRO-10150","Support inline with Sun Studio compiler","The attached patch fixes the INLINE macro so it also gets set properly when using the Sun Studio compiler.  It basically adds the __SUNPRO_C part:

#if defined(__GNUC__)
#define INLINE __inline__
#elif defined (__SUNPRO_C)
#define INLINE inline
#else
#define INLINE
#endif

It would be nice if this could go upstream so that Sun Studio also compiles cairo with inline properly.

I notice that there is some mess with how inline is handled in cairo/pixman/src.  The macro is defined in icint.h and fbpict.h.  Since fbpict.h indirectly includes icint.h this causes the macro to be defined twice.  The macro is defined separately in pixregion.c.

Also it seems some code uses __inline when it would be more consistent to use the INLINE macro.  

The attached patch defines INLINE just once in icint.h and adds an #include icint.h to pixregion.c to access this macro.

Note that the function fbmmx.c also uses __inline and could probably be made to just use INLINE.  Since I'm not building this code I didn't make this change since I can't test it.  If so then this code could be removed from icint.h

#ifndef __GNUC__
#define __inline
#endif

I'm not sure my attached patch is the best approach.  Perhaps the macro should be moved to a more general header file rather than in icint.h.  Perhaps pixman.h?  But this patch shows the issues and how to approach fixing them.",33,"0"

Using ati driver 6.2.99 (aka git shapshot as of 92baeafde8f0c1eed2b6769e96f8093e3d6d7478 (today)) works fine on a KMS aware kernel.
However if booting on a non KMS kernel where it failed to load the radeon kernel module it crashes trying to set up the 3D engine despte advertising disabling DRI.

Here /etc/modprobe.options contains options radeon modeset=1 and thus radeon kernel module failed to load because of the unknown option with a non KMS kernel.

Specifically this is about xf86-video-intel 2.6.0 for an Intel GME965 chipset.
I'm running Fedora 10 2.6.27.9-159.fc10.i686.

I think it all stems from an incomplete libdrm installation due to a missing build directory (linux-core):

In libdrm-2.4.4 directory:
# more README 

    There are two main parts to this package: the DRM client library/interface
    (libdrm.so) and kernel/hardware-specific device modules (such as i915.ko).
    Compiling
    ---------
    By default libdrm and the DRM header files will install into /usr/local/.
    If you want to install this DRM to replace your system copy say:
	    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    Then
	    make install

    To build the device-specific kernel modules:
	    cd linux-core/
	    make
	    cp *.ko /lib/modules/VERSION/kernel/drivers/char/drm/
	       (where VERSION is your kernel version: uname -f)
    Or
	    cd bsd-core/
	    make
	    copy the kernel modules to the appropriate place


I did part one and everything completed normally.  Actually I added make to the process because that's the usual order of operations.
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/
    make
    make install

However I can't do part 2 because there is no directory called linux-core.  I did see a directory called shared core.  Here's the listing:

# ls
aclocal.m4    config.status  configure.ac  libdrm        libtool    Makefile.am  README
config.guess  config.sub     depcomp       libdrm.pc     ltmain.sh  Makefile.in  shared-core
config.log    configure      install-sh    libdrm.pc.in  Makefile   missing      tests

# cd shared-core/
# ls
drm.h       drm_sarea.h  mach64_drm.h  Makefile.am  mga_drm.h      r128_drm.h  radeon_drm.h  sis_drm.h     via_drm.h
drm_mode.h  i915_drm.h   Makefile      Makefile.in  nouveau_drm.h  r300_reg.h  savage_drm.h  via_3d_reg.h  xgi_drm.h

# make
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

-------------------
So one of two things should be fixed: the README file (maybe there is no part 2 any more) or the linux-core directory needs to be added.

Thanks!  Let me know if you need more info.

clean up polkitbackend headers

Hi I am currently working on PolicyKit bindings for vala and have come across a few mistakes in the polkit-backend-1 headers. For example polkitbackendactionlookup.h references PolkitDetails without including polkit.h. This causes bindings generation to fail as the generator doesn't know about the objects that haven't been #included.

Attached is a patch to fix all issues of this kind. In addition it introduces consistency in #include style (using  instead of foo.h) and makes polkitbackend.h check for _POLKIT_BACKEND_COMPILATION as opposed to POLKIT_BACKEND_COMPILATION which is what the other headers do as well.

just recently the tiling patches for r6xx went into git master. I noticed that r600c works fine with these but r600g breaks with ColorTiling enabled. To get correct visuals out of the gallium driver I have to disable tiling first then it works again.

Seems like r600g misinterprets the tiling state of the framebuffer. The visuals are similar to the ones you got when patching mesa with the tiling patchset but forgetting to do the same for the ddx.

"LIBREOFFICE-43984","Update VCL.xcu for Chinese (Traditional) language","Created attachment 54600
Upate the Chinese fonts list to fit the situation nowdays.

Chinese (Traditional) language has two variants zh-tw and zh-hk.

The old VCL.xcu has some fonts which are not common on major platform (Windows Linux and Mac) but used by StarSuite and some outdated free fonts for Chinese (Traditional). It didn't support MacOS X yet so I edit it to fit the situation today.


Goals:

1. Remove fonts provided only by StarSuite: 方正明體 MSung Light TC 方正黑体

2. Remove outdated free Chinese fonts which is not maintained anymore: AR PL Mingti2L Big5 文鼎PL細上海宋Uni AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni 文鼎ＰＬ新宋 AR PL New Sung 文鼎PL中楷Uni AR PL ZenKai Uni

3. Add 文泉驛微米黑 文泉驛等寬微米黑 and AR PL UMing TW or AR PL UMing HK which are almost all the default fonts for Chinese in Linux distributions to appropriate sections and set them to the first priority to let fontconfig can pick it right away.

4. Add 黑體-繁 (Heiti TC) 儷黑 Pro (LiHei Pro) and 儷宋 Pro (LiSong Pro) which are the default Chinese font in MacOS 10.6 and before to the second priority. System will pick those fonts before the fonts come from Windows platform (eg. 微軟正黑體新細明體 (PMingLiU)細明體 (MingLiU)) to fit Mac's look and feel.


I would like it be release at testing builds as soon as possible to let Chinese (Traditional) users to test about this update.",27,"0"

Kernel log (drm.debug=0xe) Xorg.0.log xrandr and screenshot

Unplugging the HDMI/DP/mDP cable from dock will not automically resize framebuffer. drm/i915 receives hotplug event but does not handle it.

I submitted a patch  but it was rejected.
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/161729/
Here is the reply from ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com

We're not supposed to handle it like that. The HPD is for the main encoder
the MST hotplug handling comes via the topology manager.

Reproduction steps:
1. The external monitor with DP/mDP/HDMI cable connected to Dell Dock.
All two displays: Built-in LCD and external DP/mDP/HDMI monitor
2. Boot to Ubuntu Desktop
3. See two displays (extend mode)
4. Unplug the DP/mDP/HDMI cable
5. Press the PrtScn button to capture the screen.
We still have two screens after unplugging the cable.

"XORG-1992","[ATI/radeon] timing bug (tearing)","FC3 with Xorg 6.8.1. Radeon 9700.

This problem has plagued me for as long as I've been running Linux with this
graphics card. (XFree 4.3.0 xorg 6.7.0 and xorg 6.8.1).

Whenever there is a lot of display activity I get junk all over the screen. This
seems to be related to how the hardware is handled since I cannot do a screen
shot of the effect. Basically it smears out random stuff from the screen over
random portions. The randomness in this changes constantly so it appears more
or less like static over the screen.

Scrolling or dragging large windows will cause this effect.
Video will cause this effect to the extreme. The smaller I make the video window
the more of this effect shows up. Above a certain size the effect stops. The
higher resolution of the movie the more problems (and larger threshold size).",812,"1"

This looks to me like systemd-nspawn doesn't verify whether the FS providing -D is btrfs or not and just blindly tries to create a btrfs snapshot on top of it.


IMHO this needs at least to be handled a bit more graceful - letting the user know what's the problem.

Besides that if there's no sane way to create a btrfs snapshot (e.g. using an image file) on top of another filesystem this should be made clear in the systemd-nspawn manpage.",673,"1"

"PYCAIRO-31653","cario.version_info seems to be reporting wrong value","I apologize in advance if this is excessive I'm trying to provide all relevant information ahead of time rather than making you guys have to ask me questions.

I'm running Gentoo Linux on AMD64 with both cairo and pycairo at 1.8.10.

When attempting to use pycairo functions from wxPython I get the following error:


adam@adamc: $ ./cairotest.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ./cairotest.py line 26 in OnPaint
    cr = wx.lib.wxcairo.ContextFromDC(dc)
  File /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/lib/wxcairo.py line 121 in ContextFromDC
    ctx = pycairoAPI.Context_FromContext(ctxptr pycairoAPI.Context_Type None)
AttributeError: 'Pycairo_CAPI' object has no attribute 'Context_FromContext'


I did some digging and it looks like the _fields_ value in wxcairo.py there isn't getting populated because pycairo's version_info string is reporting (1 10 8) instead of (1 8 10). Here's the pdb output that led me to that conclusion:


AttributeError: 'Pycairo_CAPI' object has no attribute 'Context_FromContext'
> /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/lib/wxcairo.py(121)ContextFromDC()

--> 121         ctx = pycairoAPI.Context_FromContext(ctxptr pycairoAPI.Context_Type None)
    122

ipdb> cairo.version
'1.8.10'
ipdb> cairo.version_info
(1 10 8)
ipdb>


I dug into the autoconf script that builds pycairo on my system and it looks like the information is getting into the correct fields. Here's some of /src/config.h:


/* Define to the full name and version of this package. */
#define PACKAGE_STRING pycairo 1.8.10

/* Define to the one symbol short name of this package. */
#define PACKAGE_TARNAME pycairo

/* Define to the version of this package. */
#define PACKAGE_VERSION 1.8.10

/* pycairo major version */
#define PYCAIRO_VERSION_MAJOR 1

/* pycairo macro version */
#define PYCAIRO_VERSION_MICRO 10

/* pycairo minor version */
#define PYCAIRO_VERSION_MINOR 8

/* Define to 1 if you have the ANSI C header files. */
#define STDC_HEADERS 1

/* Version number of package */
#define VERSION 1.8.10


Unfortunately I don't know Python well enough to dig any further. It looks like the values are being added in the right order in /src/cairomodule.c so I don't know why I get them in the wrong order out of the compiled installed library.

If I change wxcairo.py to look for cairo.version_info < (111) (instead of 19 like it is now) then everything seems to work fine. That's the workaround I'm going to use but hopefully this report will be useful.

Following is my analisys and a possible patch:

ModemManager tries to set default storages for MEM2 and MEM3 only with `+CPMS` providing an empty string for MEM1 argument::

     [1448531013.833175] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=MEME'

     [1448531013.967401] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:792] set_default_storage_ready(): Couldn't set default storage: 'Operation not supported'

Some modems do support NULL arguments (considering that as a request to do not change the correspondant value) but passing an empty string should be considered invalid since it is not a supported value::

     [1448531007.342611] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=?'
     [1448531007.389244] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): '
     [1448531007.418215] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): OK'

According to the previous logs only SM and ME are supported strings so the command should at most be `AT+CPMS=MEME`

However HE910 does not support NULL argument either so I made the following changes in order to provide always the current value of MEM1 if no other value is provided
this way the code works fine with HE910 and should work with the other modems too since it's conservative::

patch to fix use after free in test_optpass.

When compiling mesa with address sanitizer (-fsanitize=address) and running the test suite a use after free bug is exposed in test_optpass.cpp.

This is the code:

   ralloc_free(state)
   ralloc_free(shader)

   return state->error

This is obviously not correct. First state is free'd and then state->error is used as the return value.

Given this is only a test this is not severe yet it still should be fixed so mesa can easily be tested with address sanitizer or other memory safety check tools.

See attached patch (works on both git and 18.2.4) I'm saving state->error to a variable and then returning that.",10,"0"

"XORG-21165","[i915] X hangs with UXA after changing to text console and back while xv overlay is in use","Binary package hint: xserver-xorg-video-intel

EXA seems to work quite stable with the current Intel driver shipped with Jaunty and i915. But if I use UXA it hangs very often. The most common problem is changing to text console while a video is running. It works at first but while switching back the screen stays black but the movie goes on. SSH connect is still possible but after a short period the whole system hangs.

If I change to console without running XV at first everything works fine.

I have saved the graphic registers according to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen.

I am using xv overlay because of the tearing problem. I haven't tested the problem with textured video yet but it is no real option atm.

The composite Kwin desktop effects are enabled.

The whole video memory seems to be corrupted because if I restart the system X crashes the first time and I have to relogin. Afterwards I couldn't switch to text console. Only black and colored vertical lines are shown but it is possible to switch back. If I shutdown the system and boot again it is possible to login automatically and switch to console and back. I guess both problems seem to be connected.

intel/fs: Introduce regioning lowering pass.

This legalization pass is meant to handle situations where the source
or destination regioning controls of an instruction are unsupported by
the hardware and need to be lowered away into separate instructions.
This should be more reliable and future-proof than the current
approach of handling CHV/BXT restrictions manually all over the
visitor.  The same mechanism is leveraged to lower unsupported type
conversions easily which obsoletes the lower_conversions pass.

v2: Give conditional modifiers the same treatment as predicates for
    SEL instructions in lower_dst_modifiers() (Iago).  Special-case a
    couple of other instructions with inconsistent conditional mod
    semantics in lower_dst_modifiers() (Curro).

    drm/i915: Only unpin the default ctx object if it exists

        drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

    we have contexts everywhere and so we must be careful to distinguish
    fake contexts which do not have an associated bo and real ones which
    do. In particular we now need to be careful not to dereference NULL
    pointers.

    This is one such example as the commit highlighted above failed to move
    the unpinning of the default ctx object into the real-context-only
    branch.

    drm/i915: Increase WM memory latency values on SNB

    On SNB the BIOS provided WM memory latency values seem insufficient to
    handle high resolution displays.

    In this particular case the display mode was a 2560x1440@60Hz which
    makes the pixel clock 241.5 MHz. It was empirically found that a memory
    latency value if 1.2 usec is enough to avoid underruns whereas the BIOS
    provided value of 0.7 usec was clearly too low. Incidentally 1.2 usec
    is what the typical BIOS provided values are on IVB systems.

    Increase the WM memory latency values to at least 1.2 usec on SNB.
    Hopefully this won't have a significant effect on power consumption.

    v2: Increase the latency values regardless of the pixel clock

clover/core/platform.cpp relies on pipe_loader_probe(NULL 0) to obtain the number of devices available. A fixed upper bound on device count doesn't seem ideal.

It currently appears to work for a single device because pipe_loader_sw_probe returns 1 and this is subsequently used to retrieve the device from pipe_loader_drm_probe.

"TELEPATHY-30824","Doesn't clean up properly if CM dies.","I found that sometimes opening conversations to particular contacts would wait for MC's call to tpl's ObserveChannels implementation to time out before the channel could be dispatched. And inevitably those conversations weren't logged.

I tracked this down to a pair of issues:

• tpl only forgets about a channel if it emits Closed() which doesn't happen if I kill Gabble. If the same object path is re-used the next time I connect (without restarting tpl) then it just ignores the channel.
• If tpl chooses not to observe any channels from the list passed to ObserveChannels() it never returns from the method. This is the classic expecting-at-least-one-async-operation-when-actually-there-may-be-none bug.

Bundled English spelling extension has unknown status LOdev daily build 2012-11-28 on Mac OS X

I don’t know if this a severe problem or just a glitch but anyway I need to report it:

In the newest daily master build for Mac OS X i. LOdev 4.0.0.0.alpha1+
(Build ID: 519c947f213ec69b0c92d3ea76193270644263e
pull time: 2012-11-28 04:07:39)
the “Extension Manager” window says that our bundled “English spelling dictionaries hyphenation rules thesaurus and grammar checker“ extension has “unknown” status. See the attached screenshot.

This problem was NOT present in the previous daily build I have tested i.e.
LOdev 4.0.0.0.alpha1+ (Build ID: 6aabe09ac092c51d4b394bde9c7ea0055b952e3 pull time: 2012-11-26 00:28:52).

So: a regression?!

Removing/renaming the LOdev user profile does NOT change the situation: the extension still has the “unknown” status. I have not installed any other extensions at all. It does not change the situation if I install the the US English language Pack or not.

Tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Intel).",6,"0"

"MESA-109155","Update documentation for using custom llvm to build Mesa with Meson","Current documentation at https://www.mesa3d.org/meson.html says:

> LLVM
> Meson includes upstream logic to wrap llvm-config using its standard dependency
> interface. It will search $PATH (or %PATH% on windows) for llvm-config (and
> llvm-config$version and llvm-config-$version) so using an LLVM from a
> non-standard path is as easy as PATH=/path/with/llvm-config:$PATH meson build.

That's really a very inflexible method for instance you can't use different llvm configs installed in the same directory.

As per https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2887#issuecomment-439586787
as of Meson 0.49 it's now possible to override llvm-config using --native-file option.

Here is an example:

    llvm_config=/usr/bin/llvm-config-8 # or whatever you need

    read -r -d '' native_config <<EOF
    [binaries]
    llvm-config = $llvm_config
    EOF
    
    meson ... --native-file=<(echo $native_config) ...

Please update Mesa documentation above since this option is very obscure and hard to find.",21,"0"

Dualdisplay bug.

Hello

with radeon driver and mesa in version 9.1.1 I have problem with switching display between notebook and external display in KDE 4.10.2 with kwin_gles compositor in compositing type OpenGL.

Setting dual display (left/right/above) or switching between displays causes broken screen. Please check attached screenshot.

Downgrading to mesa version 9.0.2 solve this problem. 

With intel GPU/Driver is everything OK.

"XORG-12720","picture misses colors and has pixel-lines instead","After installing 6.7.195 I got a kinda strange output on the screen of my Thinkpad X31 (Radeon Mobility M6 LY): the picture misses colors (it's not b/w but  all colors are almost gray) and you can see the pixel-lines. As I don't know how to describe that better I attach a photo of the screen.

6.7.194 worked fine for me so I tried bisecting the problem and found commit 597dffce9bdc200003d0be880235258386a0bdd7 (Alex Deucher RADEON: final fix for RMX/LVDS) as the culprit.
master with only this one commit reverted gives me a good picture again.

    glsl: Don't trust loop analysis in the presence of function calls.

    Function calls may have side effects that alter variables used inside
    the loop.  In the fragment shader they may even terminate the shader.
    This means our analysis about loop-constant or induction variables may
    be completely wrong.

    In general it's impossible to determine whether they actually do or not
    (due to the halting problem) so we'd need to perform conservative
    static analysis.  For now it's not worth the complexity: most functions
    will be inlined at which point we can unroll them successfully.

    Fixes Piglit tests:
    - shaders/glsl-fs-unroll-out-param
    - shaders/glsl-fs-unroll-side-effect

    NOTE: This is a candidate for release branches.

    drm/i915: Use for_each_crtc() when iterating through the CRTCs

    Patch done using the following semantic patch (thanks Daniel for the
    help!)

      @@
      iterator name list_for_each_entry
      iterator name for_each_crtc
      struct drm_crtc * crtc
      struct drm_device * dev

    Followed by a couple of fixups by hand (that spatch doesn't match the
    cases where list_for_each_entry() is not followed by a set of '{' '}'
    but I couldn't figure out a way to leave the '{' out of the iterator
    match).

    drm/i915/vlv: reset VLV media force wake request register

    Media force wake get hangs the machine when the system is booted without
    displays attached. The assumption is that (at least some versions of)
    the firmware has skipped some initialization in that case.

    Empirical evidence suggests we need to reset the media force wake
    request register in addition to the render one to avoid hangs.

"SYSTEMD-89048","DOC: the man pages should clarify that systemctl daemon-reload is the way to make systemd reread /etc/fstab","Hi

http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.mount.html#fstab reads that:

Mount units may either be configured via unit files or via /etc/fstab (see fstab(5) for details). Mounts listed in /etc/fstab will be converted into native units dynamically at boot and when the configuration of the system manager is reloaded. In general configuring mount points through /etc/fstab is the preferred approach. See systemd-fstab-generator(8) for details about the conversion.

Once the user modifies the /etc/fstab it is difficult to find out how to regenerate the units. Usual advice given by many is to reload the configuration systemctl daemon-reload which does not do the trick.

Running /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator does not change existing units (systemctl list-units --all) either.

Someone on Arch Linux forum adviced that /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator /run/systemd/generator '' '' should work.

Not obvious from the man pages of systemd-fstab-generator which mentions something in Examples but without any reference to the actual location.

systemd-fstab-generator converts /etc/fstab into native mount units. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated unit files in order to allow the user to override fstab with his own native unit files but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any vendor default from /usr.

Looking at it from today's perspective it may seem clear - just read and understand a buch of man pages. But without knowing the actual command argument syntax I guess I would have to stay with the easy-to-carry-out reboots of the computer. The old style was simply mount -a written directly in the man page.

How about an equivalent for systemd-fstab-generator which would simply carry out the default task which is done during boot?",2,"0"

If i append MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE=-GL_ARB_compute_shader to my steam start option there is no fading > the menu is rendered as expected.

I have made an apitrace and replayed it...
Without GL_ARB_compute_shader there are errors because Shadow of Mordor wants to use it but rendering LOOKS ok.
With GL_ARB_compute_shader the errors are gone but there is this white fading.

So I guess there is something wrong with GL_ARB_compute_shader!
Could someone look into this?

Add accessor to return the DBusGConnection that a DBusGMethodInvocation was invoked on

For NetworkManager we're adding support for a private bus socket so that NM can be used in early-boot environments without a bus daemon running.  That means we're setting up a DBusServer object on a private socket and making dbus-glib aware of the connections that appear on that socket.

Since the authentication paths depend on which DBusGConnection the method invocation comes from as the private socket only accepts connections from root and since messages from the private socket don't have sender addresses we need to figure out which DBusGConnection the DBusGInvocation is associated with so we can short-circuit authentication checks and always allow any connections from the private socket.

Unfortunately we can't get at the DBusGConnection without doing something like:

DBusGConnection *gconn = (DBusGConnection *) context

which is a complete hack.  So I'd like to formalize this since it seems useful :)",58,"0"

I have a section of the generated EPS below.
ghostscript gets a /limitcheck in the first few bytes of the pdfIm1Sep data.
I think that PSOutputDev::tilingPatternFillL1() is generating the font as a way to implement tiling patterns in Level 1.
This might have to be a case where pdftops has to rasterize in PSOutputDev::checkPageSlice().
Maybe PreScanOutputDev::tilingPatternFill() needs to do more testing that the tiled image is not an image mask.
The tiling that causes the problem has painttype 1 tilingtype 1.
Changing the call in PreScanOutputDev::tilingPatternFill() to
  gfx->drawForm(str resDict mat bbox gFalse gTrue)
(to set softMask to true) fixes this file but causes other files to be rasterized unnecessarily.

Edirol UA-101 card is not autodetected by PulseAudio and the driver is not loaded.
Therefore it cannot be used using PulseAudio without manual interaction (See workaround).
It works properly when accessed directly via ALSA.

There is a workaround to load the pulseaudio driver manually with the following script: (I have turned the frequency selector to 192kHz.)

#!/bin/bash
echo 'load-module module-alsa-sink device_id='$[$(cat /proc/asound/cards |grep UA101| cut -d'[' -f1)]' rate=192000 channels=6 channel_map=leftrightaux0aux1aux2aux3' | pacmd 


The UA-101 is an USB device that has a hardware switch to select sampling frequencies:

192000 Hz 6 Channels
96000  Hz 10 Channels
88200  Hz 10 Channels
48000  Hz 10 Channels
44100  Hz 10 Channels

When using 192000 Hz sampling rate only 6 channels are supported while otherwwise the card supports 10 channels.

the chance for typos or other errors. It also improves the visibility of the actual

A personal note I write this caused by the Attention-Message above:
Personally I think vblank_mode=0 should be default again until Tripple-Buffering can be offered. I (and the most other people) doesn't recognize tearing in FPS-Games and other applications but everyone recognize low framerates! On the other side VSYNC with Double-Buffering leads to massive performance droops and very often to stuttering. Because the OpenGL Performance is simply to low and Double-Buffering is not a solution it is a ugly workaround -)

If VSYNC should be default we should use generally OpenGL-Tripple-Buffering. Because Tripple-Buffering fixes tearing with practically no performance impact.",9,"0"
"MESA-109451","[IVBSNB] LINE_STRIPs following a TRIANGLE_FAN fail to use primitive restart","Created attachment 143227
apitrace of example program

Originally reported as a Blender bug: https://developer.blender.org/T60762
(which it is not)

Using desktop GL 3.3+.

Steps to reproduce:
* prepare a vertex and index buffer
* enable GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART
* draw a GL_TRIANGLE_FAN using those buffers
* draw any number of GL_LINE_STRIPs with those same buffers

Drawing a GL_TRIANGLE_FAN prior to GL_LINE_STRIPs makes the strip draw calls fail to use restart markers (here 0xFF) resulting in the line strips' supposedly unconnected strips being connected through a point of invalid coordinates (observed to consistently be (0 0 0)).
IOW restart markers seems to be (re-)considered as normal indices.

Interfering with GL calls that read or write to the index buffer makes the problem go away hinting at a GL state tracking or cache issue.",27,"0"

Lenovo Yoga 11S touchpad is jittery. The cursor moves a little even when I try to keep my finger still.

This is noticeable after hysteresis has turned off but libinput hysteresis was definitely not helping since it made the touchpad unusably numb and unresponsive. So the jitter problem I'm talking about here in libinput 1.10 is much better than how it was previously :)

The same jitter happens with the synaptics driver if I turn off hysteresis there. Although synaptics with hysteresis provides a nice experience... seems to be a dramatically lower hysteresis threshold.",22,"0"

Expected behaviour:
Since this is part of the gereral preferences one might expect that this setting affects all LibreOffice components including Calc.

Current behaviour:
This option seems to affect the handling of hyperlinks only in Writer. Hyperlinks in Calc and in Impress can bee activated by a single click even with this option set.

Enhancement requests:
1. I would prefer if the handling of hyperlinks would be identical in every LibreOffice component so i would propose to make Calc (and Impress) recognize that setting too.
2. At least the label of that option (or at least the documentation) should state that the setting affects only the Writer component.",409,"1"

BUILD IMAGE:         SyncEvolution 1.1.99.5

BUG DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
===========================================================

Evolution shows detached recurrences twice.

EXACT STEPS LEADING TO PROBLEM:
===========================================================
1. get your Google account invited to a meeting series from someone using Exchange
2. have the organizer modify (not delete!) one recurrence
3. sync with Evolution via CalDAV

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
===================
Regular meeting show except for the one modified recurrence which must show the updated information.


ACTUAL OUTCOME:
===================
Evolution shows the meeting twice on the day of the modified recurrence.


USER IMPACT:
===================
Doesn't know which event is the up-to-date one.


REPRODUCIBILITY:
=====================================
100%


OTHER COMMENTS:
===================

Occurs because the detached recurrence generated this way contains a RECURRENCE-ID in UTC. I suspect that this is legal according to the RFC and that there is an Evolution/libical bug here.

commit c50b45865c5c271b1d3d26cdeb938b8d48f12d0a
Author: Patrick Ohly 
Date:   Wed Aug 10 12:43:44 2011 +0200

    CalDAV: transform UTC RECURRENCE-ID for Evolution (BMC #22594)
    
    Evolution shows a meeting twice on the day of a modified recurrence
    if the meeting series was originally created and modified in Exchange
    then imported into Google Calendar.
    
    The reason is that the RECURRENCE-ID in that case ends up being
    in UTC even if the parent event has a time zone. Evolution and/or
    libical seem to have a bug here IMHO they should recognize that the
    RECURRENCE-ID time is the same.
    
    SyncEvolution now works around this by transforming the UTC
    RECURRENCE-ID time into the time zone of the DTSTART time of the
    parent event. This is combined with removal of X-LIC-ERRORS into
    a new fixIncomingCalendar() method which needs to be called
    whenever a complete VCALENDAR is received from the CalDAV server
    (adding data from a report GET).
    
    This transformation changes the rid part of the item IDs. It should
    be okay in a two-way sync (remove one sub item add another) and
    a slow sync (libsynthesis recognizes the times as equal).

GTK test program displaying an animated cursor.

Three broken cases identified possibly linked to the same cause. Test
programs are attached. Busycursor is a gtk program that displays an animated
cursor (in the default Fedora GNOME theme anyway) hidecursor just calls
XFixesHideCursor/XFixesShowCursor until cancelled.

Test case 1:
1. run busycursor click button leave cursor in busycursor window
2. open terminal run hidecursor while cursor is still in busycursor
3. ctrl+c hidecursor until exit
4. ctrl+c busycursor

Server crashes but it seems to happen in different cases. Looks like some
cursor reference is still around after the cursor got freed.

Test case 2:
1. repeat steps 1 - 3 from above

The cursor is now animated everywhere not just in the window.

Test case 3:
1. run busycursor click button move cursor outside of busycursor window
2. run hidecursor ctrl+c hidecursor

Moving the cursor back into the busycursor window won't display a cursor at

"XORG-61822","X crashes with T60p / docking station with HD4650 / 3.8.x kernel","I've already raised this bug as:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54821

Except that it occurs to me that it might be an Xorg driver bug instead. A copy-and-paste of the bug's description follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a Lenovo T60p laptop that has a built-in M66GL chip. Typically this
laptop is docked into a docking station that has a HD4650 card in a x1 (I
think) PCIe slot. There is currently no monitor connected to the HD4650.

A vanilla 32 bit 3.8.2 kernel does not boot on this laptop so long as the
laptop remains docked. (It boots OK when undocked though). The boot process
seems to hang instead although it will still perform an ACPI shutdown when I
press the power button. This hang happens with run-level 5 but not with
run-level 3.

The Fedora kernel-3.8.1-201.fc18.i686 package doesn't hang on boot but the X
server crashes instead.

A vanilla 3.7.10 boots normally regardless of whether the laptop is docked or
undocked.

I am able to add Writer documents and also slides to the master document.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new master document.
2. In the master document navigator select Insert/File and choose a Libreoffice spreadsheet.

Actual results:
Libreoffice hangs and then crashes.

Expected results:
While I would prefer to be able to add spreadsheets to the master document so that I am able to cross-reference between all documents which are part of the project (consider an exercise/answer sheet where you want to demonstrate how the spreadsheet was filled) if this is not supported I would expect to receive an error message informing me that I may not add a spreadsheet to a master document.

"XORG-93670","Reverse PRIME using two external screens on Nvidia card leads to Configure crtc 5 failed since xorg-server 1.18.0","Created attachment 120960
Short overview of the commands that lead to the issue.

System:
  Lenovo T530
  Intel HD4000
  Nvidia NVS5400 (optimus)

Kernel: 4.3.3-2-ARCH (Arch Linux)
Drivers used:
  xf86-video-nouveau
  xf86-video-intel

Internal screen and VGA output are wired to the Intel card.

Docking Station which provides 1xVGA 2x DVI and 2x DP outputs
=> The DVI/DP outputs are wired to the Nvidia card the VGA port is wired to the Intel card.

Intended setting:
- Internal Screen (LVDS1 1600x900)
- External Screen connected to first DVI port of dock (DP-1-2 1280x1024)
- External Screen connected to second DVI port of dock (DP-1-3 1280x1024)

---------------------------
|        |       |        |
| DP-1-3 | LVDS1 | DP-1-2 |
|        |       |        |
---------------------------


How to reproduce (using the Not working version setting:
  1. enable reverse PRIME: 
     xrandr --setprovideroutput nouveau Intel

  2. add left external screen: 
     xrandr --output DP-1-3 --left-of LVDS1 --mode 1280x1024
     # Left screen is switched on and aligned correctly.

  3. add right external screen: 
     xrandr --output DP-1-2 --right-of LVDS1 --mode 1280x1024
     # Right screen stays black and error message is showed in terminal: xrandr: Configure crtc 5 failed


Issue does not arise when:
 - using the packages from the Working version setting
 - using one external screen on the VGA port and one on DVI port.

"XORG-3325","Change in checking modes against monitor ranges","The Patch that's going to be attached solves 3 problems:
1. It avoids segfaults if the number of user supplied monitor ranges exceed the  
   number of preallocated slots. We should really make this dynamic - but I 
   don't think this ever caused a problem so it's more or less academic.
2. It avoids that *SyncStart starts before *BlankStart. If *BlankStart > 
   *SyncStart it is made = *SyncStart and its width is made maximal but such 
   that the blank does not exceed *Total. Since the Sync width has the same 
   restrictions as the Blank width monitors should still be able to clamp after 
   the sync pulse.
3. Over time mode validation has become inconsistent when people started to add 
   additional features to the mode validation. One such feature is that the 
   mode->Crtc* values have been (ab)used to allow the driver ValidMode function
   to pass driver normalized timing values back to the validation function.
   The introduction of these features made the code less readable and created 
   numerous possibly unintended side effects in the validation semantics.
   I've attempted to consolidate these changes making the code more consistent
   and eliminating a number of side effects.
   This should not cause problems for the majority of drivers still it should  
   receive testing - especially with ATi Mach64 and Radeon code.",900,"1"

Then it would bounce the mail since it believed that resolved to _itself_ and it had no knowledge of infradead.org as a local domain.

Rather than fixing postfix or switching to a non-broken MTA I believe a workaround was put in place -- just a hardcoded rule so that all mail to the infradead.org domain was routed directly to pentafluge.infradead.org ignoring the MX records.

That was fine for some years but pentafluge is being retired now and is no longer receiving mail. It's still on the MX list but it died last week for some reason and if it wasn't for the fact that fd.o is still trying to send mail there nobody would have cared.

Please can someone fix the mail routing?

"XORG-99220","Depth=32 not redrawn correctly (CopyArea has no effect)","The window manager called awesome by default uses depth=32 for its windows. This causes the following problem. When starting with the argument `--no-argb` which makes it use the root's depth and visual instead the problem does not occur.

* Start awesome
* Start a terminal (Mod4+Enter in the default config)
* Switch to tag 2 (tag=workspace Mod4+2 in the default config)
* Notice that the taglist at the top of the screen now has 2 highlighted
* Switch back to tag 1 (Mod4+1)
* Notice that the taglist *still* has the 2 highlighted

When one now moves the terminal over the taglist (click+drag on the titlebar) the exposed areas are redrawn correctly.

Awesome draws to a pixmap and when done does a CopyArea request to update the window. Expose events are handled in the same way.

I have several reasons to think that this is a bug in the server:

* `--no-argb` / using the default depth and visual makes the problem go away
* Exposure shows the expected content hence the pixmap used for double buffering has the right content
* People reported that switching video drivers caused the problem or made it go away.

Also the following patch fixes the problem. The effect of the patch should be to update all windows with automatic redirection (depth=32 but parent has another depth) needlessly all the time. The word needlessly here shows that something is wrong but I cannot figure out what (the patch should not make a difference but it does!). The damage extension seems to report things correctly but still the composite extension code sees an empty damage area...

Xorg.0.log

My laptop is an HP Envy 17 3D. I am running Gentoo and using vgaswitcheroo to switch between radeon and intel (i915). I have the radeon driver working with some difficulty (see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58894) - i.e. I have to attach an external monitor to get the laptop screen turned on after KDE has started.

I would like to be able to use the intel driver and switch off the radeon chip because it uses much less power. I can do this using vgaswitcheroo but the intel driver gives me 2 problems:

1) The laptop screen stays black after the boot process has completed. If I attach an external monitor I can get a picture on that but the laptop screen just stays black.

2) Moving the mouse pointer to the top left corner (rather the top left square of maybe 1/3 of the screen) the screen starts to flicker from the mouse pointer and downwards.

I also notice that it takes quite a while before KDE displays anything during the boot with the intel driver enabled compared to the time it takes if the radeon driver is used.

system state after crash and automatic (but weirdly broken) gdm restart

I just had an X server crash with linux 2.6.32 (KMS enabled) xorg-intel 2.9.1 libdrm 2.4.15 on an EeePC 900 (lspci reports 915GM/GMS/910GML).

after the X server crashed i got dumped back to vt1 and then gdm restarted a new X server.  But gdm was really oddly-behaved: the screen would update when a switched to it (with ctrl-alt-F8) but then when i interacted with it nothing would visually update (only the mouse cursor would move) and the input box for gdm had a black bar over it (it's usually white).  switching away to vt1 and then back would repaint the screen with the outcome of whatever activity i'd done but it would still not be an active screen.

a second restart of gdm didn't resolve the problem either.

i grabbed a gpu dump after the automated gdm restart (but before i'd restarted it by hand).  i'm attaching a dump of the system state including that gpu dump gathered by the script i posted here as attachment 31967).

Some interesting output in the gdm log from the crashed session (full log included in the attached tarball):

the relevant bit of dmesg appears to be:

full dmesg is also within the attached tarball if you want more.  Is that reboot required something that should be propagated out to the user more directly somehow?

After a full system reboot things seem to be back to normal.

"LIBREOFFICE-49365","Libreoffice fails to start on second screen with gtk vcl plugin","I have dual X screen configuration on Ubuntu 12.04 with NVidia 6600 nvidia-current-updates 295.40-0ubuntu1 and XFCE+Metacity.

This is the error produced:

WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /tmp/keyring-XTNyXK/pkcs11: Нет такого файла или каталога
The program 'soffice' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
  (Details: serial 1595 error_code 8 request_code 62 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

    gallivm: fix improper clamping of vertex index when fetching gs inputs
    
    Because we only have one file_max for the (2d) gs input file the value
    actually represents the max of attrib and vertex index (although I'm
    not entirely sure if we really want the max since the max valid value
    of the vertex dimension can be easily deduced from the input primitive).
    
    Thus in cases where the number of inputs is higher than the number of
    vertices per prim we did not properly clamp the vertex index which
    would result in out-of-bound fetches potentially causing segfaults
    (the segfaults seemed actually difficult to trigger but valgrind
    certainly wasn't happy). This might have happened even if the shader
    did not actually try to fetch bogus vertices if the fetching happened
    in non-active conditional clauses.
    
    To fix simply use the correct max vertex index value (derived from
    the input prim type) instead when clamping for this case.

I have done some searching and several people have mentioned this but no one knows what this error is or how it might degrade the system.  

Since I'm having some problems with the driver (for example see my bug report regarding glDrawPixels #19888) I'd like to know what causes this error and what driver capabilities are affected.

When running supertux or urbanterror or any other game (with wine also) with resolution lower then native one in fullscreen the image is equal to the selected resolution with black borders filling the rest of the screen.

Steps to reproduce:

Run any 3D game and set resolution to lower then native one in game menu (ie 1024x768 on a 1280x800 display) in fullscreen.
The game runs with 1024x768 resolution but is not maximized it is in the center of the display and the rest is filled with black color.

It can be very annoying on games that run natively in 800x600 and can not be set to any other resolution the game is displayed inside very smalled window in the center of the screen.

If the game support resolution change if u set it to your display native resolution then it runs fine (ie 1280x800 on 1280x800 display)

The problem is that dbus-signature.c unit tests do the following many times:

_dbus_assert (dbus_signature_iter_next (

This is incorrect because the operation executed within the assertion is not
idempotent i.e. it has side effects.  That operation advances given iterator. 
As a result if the code is built without assertions these lines are not
compiled which translates in the program not behaving as expected.

The solution is to call these operations outside the assertions and only assert
their results.  Doing so the test passes correctly (under NetBSD at the very

Obviously some extra <![CDATA[ gets inserted here. I wonder where that comes from.

Can you run the sync again with syncevolution-1.1.99.6-1 and this time use a higher log level? On the command line use
   syncevolution --run loglevel=5 
or edit the ~/.config/syncevolution/default/peers//config.ini and increase the log level there.

What I'd like to see is the message dump (syncevolution-log_msg*incoming.[wb]xml) and translation into XML (syncevolution-log_trm*_incoming.xml). Is there already the CDATA in the incoming.wbxml?

I had a chance to discuss this with Ralf Becker at CalConnect. It is related to eGroupware bugs:
https://community.egroupware.org/egroupware/index.php?menuaction=tracker.tracker_ui.index&cd=yes

https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3020 is about the regression
https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2975 about the reason why it was introduced.

It seems that the bug was introduced in a attempt to fix escaping issues when using XML. But it broke WBXML because CDATA is now used unconditionally. The real fix must be to detect whether WBXML or XML are used instead of checking which client is talking to the server.

As a client-side workaround setting enableWBXML=0 should work.

"SYNCEVOLUTION-52897","relax need for template during configuration","


---- Reported by patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-03-22 06:40:26 +0000 ----

Currently SyncEvolution insists on having a template when creating a config from scratch. This was meant to address typos like --configure sheduleworld. But when the command line contains enough information no template is needed.

The same logic was applied to configuring a source: if a source is not among those defined by the template configuring it is rejected as a typo.

I suggest to add --template none as a special case. If that argument is given then SyncEvolution shall suppress the errors and create a config based on the command line properties (whatever those are).

If a source is among those which has command line properties it shall also be accepted.

If the sync properties contain the obligatory properties the need template error shall also be skipped. Obligatory at this time: only syncURL.

Examples:

--configure foobar => error need template
--configure --template none foobar => empty foobar peer config no sources configured
--configure ical20/backend=calendar foobar => foobar peer config with source ical20
--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => foo peer config no sources configured

> If a source is among those which has command line properties it shall also be
> accepted.

Clarification: backend=calendar is enough for has properties there's no need to explicitly specify the source name as in ical20/backend=calendar.

> Examples:
[...]
> --configure ical20/backend=calendar foobar => foobar peer config with source
> ical20
> --configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => foo peer config no sources
configured  

This is not implied by any of the rules above. Adding a rule that explicitly set properties of sources cause those sources to be created would be needed but that a) gets complicated and b) is inconsistent with the concept that these properties are merely filters which may or may not apply.

What I meant was this example:

--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar => bar peer config no sources
configured
--configure syncURL=local://@foo bar ical20 => error about ical20
--configure syncURL=local://@foo backend=calendar bar ical20 => bar config with ical20 source
--configure syncURL=local://@foo ical20/backend=calendar bar ical20 => bar config with ical20 source

Author: Patrick Ohly

    command line: relaxed checking of config creation (BMC #14805)
    
    SyncEvolution used to insist on having a template when creating a
    config from scratch. This was meant to address typos like --configure
    sheduleworld.  But when the command line contains enough information
    no template is needed.
    
    The same logic was applied to configuring a source: if a source was not
    among those defined by the template configuring it was rejected as a
    typo.
    
    With this patch there are two ways around these checks:
    - --template none and/or
    - specifying required properties on the command line
    
    This patch also removes the special cases for your SyncML server
    account name/password. Username/password aren't always needed
    (previous patch) nor are they always for a SyncML server anymore.

Rotate documents correctly

I've tried to rotate a PostScript file from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1031838 in evince and the rotation was not quite correct. It doesn't show anything for 90° and 270° just warnings about matrices. So I've tested this also with some other PostScript files and I've seen that the rotation doesn't work for any of them.

I've prepared a patch which performs the rotation by inserting command rotate to the PostScript program right after %%EndSetup and adjusting of offsets accordingly. I've tested the patch for rendering of slices and it works. But I'm not entirely sure whether it will work in every situation.

I hope you can understand what this bug is.

dmesg from working kernel (commit 56350fb8978bbf4aafe08f21234e161dd128b417)

TLDR - Commit a45b30a6c5db631e2ba680304bd5edd0cd1f9643 breaks external displays attached to a Dell TB16 dock.

Hardware is a Dell Precision 5520 developer edition laptop attached to a Dell TB16 (Thunderbolt 3) dock.  This laptop does not have a separate discrete GPU only the GPU integrated into its Core i5 processor.

OS is Fedora 27 but dmesg files in this bug are from mainline kernel.

When the laptop is docked it is closed and I use *only* the displays (and keyboard etc.) attached to the TB16.  This works fine up through commit 56350fb8978bbf4aafe08f21234e161dd128b417 but commit a45b30a6c5db631e2ba680304bd5edd0cd1f9643 causes the displays to be disabled as soon as the i915 module is loaded leaving no working display at all.

I had a heck of a time preventing the i915 module from being loaded so the two dmesg files were produced with the following sequence:

* Blacklist the i915 module in /etc/modprobe.d and rebuild the initramfs
* Rename the i915.ko file under /lib/modules/...
* Reboot to multi-user.target
* Remove the drm modules that somehow got auto-loaded
  - modprobe -r drm_kms_helper
  - modprobe -r drm
* Rename i915.ko back to its correct file name
* Load the drm and i915 modules with debugging enabled
  - modprobe drm debug=0x0f
  - modprobe i915",114,"0"

    i965/gen9: Support fast clears for 32b float
    
    SKL supports the ability to do fast clears and resolves of 32b RGBA as both
    integer and floats. This patch only enables float color clears because we
    haven't yet enabled integer color clears (HW support for that was added in
    BDW).
    
    v2: Remove LUMINANCE16F and INTENSITY16F special cases since they are now
    handled by Neil's patch to disable MSAA fast clears.

"WAYLAND-104939","Tablet tools without ABS_Z cause a crash when updating rotation","This affects tablets that are not listed in libwacom specifically tablets where libwacom does not provide the stylus axis information.

On tablet init we check the event codes. A tablet may have ABS_Z and thus have rotation. Or it has BTN_TOOL_MOUSE + ABS_TILT_X/Y and thus have rotation. On init all axes are marked as 'changed' to ensure we send the data in the first event. For non-libwacom tablets the tool has the same bits set as the tablet provides so if mouse+tilt is there we have rotation on all tools. But the code itself relies on ABS_Z for rotation on all the styli (except mouse/lense).

In the case of Aiptek tablets we do have mouse+tilt but we *don't* have ABS_Z. If the first tool that comes into proximity is *not* the mouse/lens tool [1] we try to update the rotation by accessing ABS_Z. This leads to a null-pointer dereference in tablet_update_artpen_rotation() on the very first event.

See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535755.

It doesn't matter that the tool never sends the actual events - because all axes are marked as 'changed' on proximity in we always access the axis on the first event and crash.

Addition of an AC_ARG_ENABLE to optionally turn off the configure check would make this much simpler.

Hello

Problem description:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) hangs the GPU.


Expected Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) should not hang the GPU.


Obtained Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) freezes the system for a few seconds but afterwards (3 sec. approx.) I can close the application that caused the GPU hang.
Video output is non-existing in Cheese or Guvcview (I only see the black window where the video should be).
If I still try to take a picture with Cheese for example it will capture the photo correctly!
When playing a movie file I get no video (only sound output is available).


When does it happen: Always (no special steps are necessary to reproduce this error).

"MESA-29091","1.9RC5 server crash when starting GLX 1.3 app with mesa 7.8 Intel dri2 driver.","The 1.9 RC5 server crashes when starting a GLX 1.3 app (I've tried glxgears_fbconfig or Clutter apps) with an older (I'm using mesa 7.8.1) Intel dri2 driver.

Compiz works fine as does glxgears and other non GLX 1.3 apps.

It seems that DRI2InvalidateDrawable is being called before the drawable is associated with a context as in all the crashes I've seen drawable->driContextPriv is a valid pointer to a 0-initialised structure.

This does not occur with the Intel driver from mesa master.

This backtrace is from running glxgears_fbconfig which has died at glXSwapBuffers.  Different Clutter apps die with a different backtrace but they all terminate in the DRI2InvalidateDrawable → intelDRI2Invalidate pair with a 0-initialised drawable->driContextPriv.

The built-ins suffixed with “Lod” are allowed only in a vertex shader. For the “Lod” functions lod is directly used as the level of detail.


The glsl2 compiler errantly accepts fragment shaders that use the texture2DLod() function.  This function was added as a frag shader feature through the GL_ATI_shader_texture_lod extension (undocumented?  google it) but it's not standard GLSL.

There are some built-in functions that only apply to vertex shaders or fragment shaders but I don't see how/where the glsl2 compiler makes any distinction.

I'm attaching a piglit shaderrunner test for this but I don't see a way to indicate to shaderrunner that a shader should NOT compile.

VMware Workstation checks to see if a shader using GL_ATI_shader_texture_lod and texture2DLod() compiles and tries to use it if successful.  The glsl compiler allows it but we blow-up/fail later when we try to actually run the shader.",1,"0"

Hi.

Tried out kmscon it's awesome.

But there's a regression caused by mesa update wich prevents me from using 3d acceleration.

commit 345fc4161967f15fb80848cd7dc6a63100f8c12d
Author: Eric Anholt 
Date:   Wed Oct 12 17:05:20 2011 -0700

    swrast: Convert color glReadPixels slow path to using MapRenderbuffer.
    
    This may be a bit slower than before because we're switching from
    per-format compiled loops in GetRow to
    _mesa_unpack_rgba_block_unpack's loop around a callback to unpack a
    pixel.  The solution there would be to make _mesa_unpack_rgba_block
    fold the span loop into the format handlers.
    
    (On the other hand function call overhead will hardly matter if
    MapRenderbuffer means the driver gets the data into cacheable memory
    instead of uncached).
    
    The adjust_colors code should no longer be required since the unpack
    function does the 565 to float conversion in a single pass instead of
    converting it (poorly) through 8888 as apparently happened in the
    past.

    This moves the detiling to the fbo mapping r200 depth is always tiled
    and we can't detile it with the blitter.

"LIBREOFFICE-66403","UI: Clicking OK on Tools>AutoCorrect options>Exceptions window ends in infinite loop","Problem description: 

Tested on Caolan McNamara's internal build for Red Hat 4.0.3.3 for RHEL6.

When the default locale is not C or en-US@UTF-8 clicking OK on the Exception (Tools->AutoCorrect options->Exceptions) window make LO going AWOL (e.g. freezed windows still there not refreshed 100% CPU on one core).

Tested in writer impress and calc with locales C (ok) en_US.UTF-8 (ok) de_DE.UTF-8 (ok) and fr_FR.UTF-8 (not ok).

Steps to reproduce:
1. yum install libreoffice-langpack-fr
2. LANG=fr-FR.UTF-8 libreoffice --writer (or --impress or --calc)
3. Outils->Options d'AutoCorrection tab Exceptions
   Switch languages from French to Anglais (U.S.A.)
   Click OK

Current behavior:

LO not responsive anymore CPU goes 100% on one core.

Expected behavior:

Close window get back to work.

"POPPLER-19789","pdfimages in poppler-utils ignores -j to extract jpegs (*.jpg)","this bug has been reported here:

https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/poppler/+bug/320006

The command pdfimages in poppler-utils 10.0.3-0ubuntu1 (9.04 Jaunty) still ignores the option -j to extract .jpg. It always extracts .ppm. The same applies to poppler-utils 0.8.7-1ubuntu0.1 (8.10 Intrepid).

I deal with PDFs that are produced by gscan2pdf 0.9.27 (9.04 Jaunty) which contain one page-filling JPG per page. I attach here a Testscan.pdf of one empty paper. (BTW: I use i386 packages)

With xpdf-utils 3.02-1.4ubuntu1 I get what I expect:

Since the update from Fedora 22 to 24 and the associated upgrade of the kernel to 4.6/4.7
the screen of my Acer Aspire V3-772G (Intel i7-4702MQ GTX760M) has started to flicker.
The flickering starts immediately when the user login screen appears.

The flickering does happen occasionally when moving the mouse or when having something visible on the screen that moves (e.g. a watch command that has its output changed regularly or a youtube movie..).

The flickering does not occur when passing i915.enable_psr=0 to the kernel.

System: Acer Aspire V3-772G: i7-4702MQ GTX760M (Optimus) no external display.

"DRI-94625","[SKL mobile] Some flickering then complete system freeze after HDMI hotplug","When connecting an HDMI monitor the external monitor lights up but the laptop's internal panel will flicker usually until I type a key (have an open xterm focused already) or move the mouse pointer slightly. The display is then stable and I might be able to move the mouse pointer around and start some programs but after a while the system freeze completely (doesn't respond to ping).


System is Dell XPS 15 9550 i7-6700HQ stepping 3 microcode 0x74.

Internal panel is eDP1 3840x2160.
External is 1920x1200. I've tried the HDMI port and also with a TB3->DP
and TB3->HDMI adapters all with same results.

This system also has NVIDIA GM107M but I've disabled both the nouveau and the nvidia driver to rule that out.

move the mouse pointer means using the built-in touchpad.

With
    Fedora 23 plus kernel drm-intel-nightly as of 2016-03-10 21:00 UTC
the system will typically freeze hard within 10 seconds of inserting the HDMI cable (in the laptops fixed HDMI port). It feels like the freeze happens when I touch the mouse but I'm not sure if that's just coincidence.


With
    Fedora 23 plus kernel drm-intel-nightly as of 2016-03-19 13:00 UTC
the behaviour is slightly improved. I'm now been able to use the system for minutes after hotplugging the external monitor. I still get the flickering of the internal panel when inserting the cable - this disappears when I touch the mouse. I'm then able to type use the mouse move windows between internal and external display etc with no freeze happening. After a while with no apparent problems I disconnected the external monitor - still no problems - then reconnected it again. The external display lights up as expected but now the complete freeze occurred within a few seconds.

Some more attempts indicate that it can still freeze (shortly after) the first hotplug but sometimes not until after the second or third. So it seems reproducible around 3 out of 4 times.

It can also freeze if I use the Gnome Display control panel to disable the external monitor then enabling it again (without removing the cable).

Sometimes the flickering that occurs after hotplug will go away if I touch the touchpad slightly and pressing a key doesn't help. Other times it's the reverse - pressing a key will stop the flickering but then moving the mouse pointer slightly will set it off again.

During these tests it's happened that the internal panel remains black. At one point it behaved like this:
  a) move the mouse pointer to the EXTERNAL panel => internal panel lights up.
  b) move the mouse pointer back to the INTERNAL panel => internal panel goes black.
During this maneuver the external panel consistently showed a correct image.",387,"1"

"WAYLAND-102039","LID_SWITCH_RELIABILITY=write_open doesn't work","Background: Benjamin Tissoires reverted an upstream kernel change which was intended to make Linux more compatible with default Windows behavior:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/acpi/button.c?id=878d8db039daac0938238e9a40a5bd6e50ee3c9b

The original commit was to work around bugs like this one where the laptop lid switch works as expected in Windows without installing any vendor drivers:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191211

With the revert the bad behavior has returned (with kernel option as only recourse for users).

In the revert message he suggests working around the problem in user space with a HWDB rule. I have created one:

$ cat /etc/udev/hwdb.d/91-libinput-model-quirks.hwdb

# Razer Blade laptops need us to write the open lid switch event
libinput:name:*Lid Switch*:dmi:*svnRazer:pnBlade*
 LIBINPUT_ATTR_LID_SWITCH_RELIABILITY=write_open

And indeed it sets the property:

$ udevadm info --path=/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/device:18/PNP0C09:01/PNP0C0D:00/input/input0/event0

However libinput doesn't actually write open to the lid switch and prevent a system from suspending after lid open. Systemd eventually times out and sees that the lid is closed:

$ sudo cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state 
state:      closed

Note that the fbconfig with an associated visual ID of 0 says that it can be used to create a window a pixmap or a pbuffer.

It is possible to have an fbconfig that has a visual ID of 0 that may be compatible with some other visual.  However no driver supported by xorg does this.

patch to avoid gcc warning in libXext-1.0.4

Attached is a small patch to avoid the (only) gcc warning in libXext (V 1.0.4)
    ../../libXext-1.0.4/src/extutil.c:272: warning: passing arg 2 of pointer to          function discards qualifiers from pointer target type

It's nice that you have added proper prototypes somewhere between V 1.0.2 and V 1.0.4 but unfortunately that now causes a compiler warning.

The handler may do many things but it certainly must not modify the strings
passed to it as arg 2 (ext_name) and arg 3 (reason).

IMHO the proper way to handle all this is to declare a function pointer type in
Xext.h and then use that type in extutil.c and globals.c.

If that makes it necessary to create new versions xextproto-7.0.4 and
libXext-1.0.5 (requiring xextproto >= 7.0.4) so be it.",108,"0"

Description: I'm taking an online AI class where the first project was to modify a python pacman game. The game would crash the xserver whenever it tried to draw pacman facing up or down. Multiple Arch users reported this bug as well across multiple desktop environments and at least xf86-video-intel (HD4000) and xf86-videeo-nouveau (GeForce 6100). Python was using the Tk interface. This Tk script will cause the crash. (Run with wish . It will work as expected with -start 10 or -start 190 but will crash with -start 100 or -start 280. I was able to run an XCB program that drew arcs that open up and down as expected but I don't know if that means anything..

There was a problem that LO crashed when working with documents which had > 65535 style switches. The crash was fixed but the performance greatly degraded:
attached is the 2MB file which was taking ~2-3 min to open on LO 3.3 and it takes 9 min to open on LO 3.4.
Saving this document takes way more than an hour (!) (LO 3.3 was saving it in less than 10min).
Just to close this document in LO 3.4 takes ~8 min (it's a Core 2 Duo 2.1GHz and I was using 64bit rpms: libreoffice3.4-base-3.4.0-12.x86_64 ...).

On comparison Word 2007 on similar hardware takes about 50sec to open and less than 2 min to save.

I must admit this document is not an average one the users work with but:
a) it's a good test which should nicely show the slow parts of the code and which when optimized would bring speed benefits to smaller documents as well
b) it's a regression so the problem should (hopefully) be easier to understand
c) this document can be opened/saved withing reasonable time on other office software (on very similar hardware) so there should be more efficient algorithms available",1093,"1"

However NotifyPointer focus out events should also be sent to the window containing the pointer (the child itself) as performed by the core input event system.

This surfaced as a bug in Firefox/GTK3 that caused focus handing to fail due to a missing FocusOut (detail=NotifyPointer) event when focus was moved from PointerRoot to another toplevel after a window's destruction. As a GTK window's focus is changed when a NotifyPointer event occurs on a window this was causing the window to permanently retain focus (according to GTK at least). This does not occur on the core/non-xi2 backend which does send NotifyPointer focus out events to the pointer window.

The events that should occur when moving from PointerRoot to another window are detailed quite well here

The TimerSet function uses current now value though. Therefore subtracting the old new from the new timer's expires results in a higher value than delta + 250.

The bug:
1. Some hindi characters in words are not rendered properly whereas the same words are properly rendered in QT4 and GTK applications

2. Please see the bug in video action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9f3CrsNjA

How to reproduce:
3. Download Nithyananda Font which has psts entries for िं र् x ि र् x िं (where x is a devanagari consonanat like क प च)
http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Nithyananda+Hindi+Unicode+Font+%28GPL%29?content=142684

Expected Behavior:
3. Should render text as in qt4 or gtk apps.




Additional information:

Most hindi or devanagari fonts e.g. mangal.ttf or arialunicode.ttf etc. do not have complete opentype font substitution table they use anchors to get these characters without the substitution lookup code. the 3 characters/glyphs are:

िं (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign anusvara/bindu) (किं जिं दिं रिं)
र्ि (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign R halant) (र्कि र्जि र्दि र्रि)
र्िं (devanagari sign I + devanagari sign R halant + bindu) (र्किं र्जिं र्दिं र्रिं)

and Fonts which has the code for the above 3 combinations the bug triggers else most common hindi/devanagari fonts do not have the substitution code.
the Fonts which has the code:

http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Nithyananda+Hindi+Unicode+Font+%28GPL%29?content=142684
http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/GISTYogeshN.htm

It seems to me that Libreoffice 3.4 and Openoffice 3.x do not use the code of post base substitution correctly whereas QT and GTK based applications like kwrite and gedit display the above 3 glyphs properly.


Please see a video (3 minutes) of the bug where kwrite gedit and libreoffice writer is shown by typing a few words.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9f3CrsNjA


typing or copy pasting the words in libreoffice also causes the bug:

(please notice if a character starts with ि(small i) followed by 2 consonants then a ं (bindu) र्+character (R Halant + character) र्(character)ं (R Halant+consonant+Bindu) then only the bug is visible)

I hope this is the right section to report this bug if not please redirect me to the appropriate one.

I am having trouble getting audio via HDMI/DP working.  My setup has a Thinkpad Ultra dock which has a Synaptics DP MST hub connected to a Dell U2415 monitor via DP.

"DRI-87976","Iceland chips support missing","Hello

I have recently bought a Toshiba Satellite L50-B-1HU including a R7M260 based on a Topaz chip. According to AMD CodeXL 1.6 (used on windows) this chip is a member of the recent Iceland chip family for which there is no support in the Linux kernel nor in the radeon DDX nor in libdrm.

I have read some articles on the internet and it seems that this chip is quite the same as the oland version (same number of shaders unit frequencies etc) so I hoped that it was a simple rebranding.
Therefore I have (naively) tried to add support myself by adding the PCI-ID (0x6900/0x6901) to the radeon drm driver radeon ddx driver and libdrm and telling that this is an Oland chip. But it doesn't work.

Could it be possible to add support for this chip?

Or if the chip is supposed to be supported only by the same code as for the Tonga chip (that we don't know yet when it will be merged) could it be possible to have some documentation so that I can make some dirty code to make a minimal support for personal use?
(I would like to try Clover on this chip).

Thanks for any help.",754,"1"

I want to ask if you could host my project chemical-mime-data. This project was

log of a touch during typing with yubikey inserted

I'm using libinput 1.1.5 on Arch Linux with xorg on a Dell XPS 13 9350.
In order to quickly unlock my password manager I always keep a nano YubiKey in one USB slot. It looks to interfere with the DWT mechanism.

In attachment a log produced by 'sudo libinput-debug-events --enable-dwt --verbose' during an experiment where a touch is wrongly allowed during some keyboard activities (holding a key).

"TELEPATHY-27855","TpChannelManager should leave TargetID in the request dict (or even add it if missing?)","11:55  i made TpChannelManager normalize from id to handle
...
12:03  wjt: didn't we decide that for requesting phone numbers with 
              trailing DTMF TpChannelManager should pass the un-normalized ID 
              through as well?
...
12:04  generally we should propogate unmolested ids as much as 
                  possible
12:04  right
12:04  currently we guarantee to remove the ID from the dict entirely
12:04  so passing it through after all shouldn't break anyone

This would also be useful to fix Gabble Bug #22456 and Bug #25143 but is not sufficient:

12:06  smcv: right but that's not the problem
12:06  smcv: the handle normalization function thorws an erorr
12:06  because foo isn't a valid conference JID if you don't have a 
             conf server
12:07  yeah
12:07  perhaps have a flag TpChannelManagers can set for it's ok I 
              don't need my handles normalized?

(If we want such a flag we should probably add it at the same time.)

3. udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdc1
4. udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdc1

Actual results:
Both /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdb1 were unmounted.

Expected results:
Only /dev/sdc1 gets unmounted /dev/sdb1 remains mounted.

Additional info:
I also tried connecting 3 USB drives unmounting /dev/sdd1 or /dev/sdc1 caused /dev/sdb1 to be unmounted but the other /dev/sdc1 or /dev/sdd1 remained mounted.

/dev/sdb is a USB hard disk sdc and sdd are USB flash drives.

I asked him to tell gdb to disassemble and got the following snippet:

   0x00007ffff0ae2118 :   and    %eax%r15d
   0x00007ffff0ae211b :   mov    0x78(%rsp)%rax
=> 0x00007ffff0ae2120 :   mov    (%rax%rdx4)%edx
   0x00007ffff0ae2123 :   callq  0x7ffff0ade5c0 

So this segfaults right before calling QXcbConnection::atomName(unsigned int)[1].

The relevant code is here: [2]

Because it segfaults right before calling atomName() it must be dying in line 1064 where it just indexes into the result of xcb_xkb_get_names_value_list_unpack().

If you want me to guess then the size of this struct changed because of commit 37d0f55392d68d0a05dcf5d793d729e49108f1b7. This introduced a new alignment_pad field and thus shifted all the following members around by four byte. (Having just written this sentence I am pretty sure that this is the reason for the crash).

    llvmpipe: fix blending with half-float formats
    
    The fact that we flush denorms to zero breaks our half-float
    conversion and blending. This patches enables denorms for
    blending. It's a little tricky due to the llvm bug that makes
    it incorrectly reorder the mxcsr intrinsics:

There seems to be a few different problems

a) in fcxml.c when we pop off FcPopValue it looks to me that we should call
FcValueDestroy on the returned value
b) in fcpat.c when we check to see if a string can be deleted we check to see if
the string is hashed and if it is in the hash then not delete it but when a
string gets hashed a copy is taken of it so the original string becomes
undeletable afterwards. Presumably the intention is to see if the string to be
deleted actually belongs to the hashtable and not delete it in that case
c) in fcxml.c we push a FcVStackPushPattern(parse FcPatternFreeze(pattern)) a
frozen pattern has a ref of -1 and can't be deleted normally with
FcPatternDestroy. I'm unsure of what the proper course of action here is.

I cross-checked a long document with multiple EPS files and I found two regressions over LO 4.1.x that are still related to that bug. For this I open this new bug report.

Problem description: If an EPS graphic exceeds 100% (relative to text width) it is lost in PDF export. This is an regression over LO 4.1.4 where this was no problem. Attached is a sample .odt and .pdf file showing two pages with EPS graphics. On the first page a EPS graphic with 101% width which is entirely lost in the PDF export. The EPS graphic on the second page (100% width) has no problem.

Another related problem for which I opened a separate bug 81592: Severe regression of rendering quality of EPS graphics in 4.2.5 over 4.1.x.

"FONTCONFIG-87122","Treat color bitmap font as scalable","Blink blocks all the non-scalable fonts) color or not. Currently fontconfig treats any bitmap font as non-scalable.

As a result Blink (used by Chrome and Opera) rejects color fonts in Google's proposed color bitmap font format (such as Noto Color Emoji). 

By treating color bitmap fonts as scalable we can get 'Noto Color Emoji' and other color fonts in the same format to be accepted by Blink. 

An alternative is to change fontconfig to introduce 'FC_COLOR' and let clients such as Blink accept color fonts (bitmap or not). My patch for that is http://goo.gl/rDRffN

In the meantime fontconfig on ChromeOS uses  the following addition to local.conf to treat Noto Color Emoji as scalable.  See http://crbug.com/386772#c15

volund-benchmark.sh

Hello

a general issue encountered in DXVK is that pipelines have to be compiled at draw time as the pipeline state and the combination of shaders used for rendering are not known in advance. This leads to noticable stutter in a lot of games when the shader cache is cold.

The attached script measures the pipeline compile times of the Unity Blacksmith demo which can be downloaded here:
https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/06/24/releasing-the-blacksmith/

I picked this demo because it warms the shader cache as part of its loading process making for a reproducible test case. On my Ryzen 2700X setup all the vkCreateGraphicsPipelines calls combined take about four minutes using the Higher preset on mesa 18.0.1 llvm 6.0 and latest dxvk-master where about 2/3rds of the total CPU time is spent inside LLVM and 1/6th inside libvulkan-radeon.

An optimization I have in mind for DXVK would be to use VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT in order to reduce the initial compile times and to compile an optimized version of the pipeline asynchronously in the background. However this requires driver support for VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT.

Please let me know if this is a viable option and if significant gains are to be expected when implementing support for this flag in the driver.",222,"1"

This bug only happens when I enable MigrationHeuritic greedy with EXA. (This is a Fedora 8 machine and I am also using the xf86-video-radeon driver from git.) I set the MigrationHeuristic in order to improve EXA's performance except that now my desktop ends up looking like on the attachment.

"POPPLER-36693","poppler: crash on truncated JPEG/DCT stream","Attached fuzzed PDF from Sauli Pahlman crashes poppler at or around DCTStream::reset.  The reason for the crash is that the file contains a truncated JPEG image which does not contain full image header.  jpeg_read_header() called from DCTStream::reset returns JPEG_SUSPENDED and some of the cinfo struct members are not properly set causing a NULL pointer dereference crash on this specific file.

This change avoids the crash on this file:

Also when I select the option to automatically rotate the cube when dragging a window to a screen edge the cube sort of half-rotates and then sticks there.

This has been an issue with recent git versions of Mesa/r600g for probably a week I just haven't gotten around to reporting it.

Currently I am using the X/Mesa stack from the Ubuntu Xorg-Edgers PPA on Kubuntu 11.04 with KDE 4.6.2. I have a custom kernel which is currently based on Linux 2.6.39-rc5-git2 it has the latest drm-next patches added to it.

r300g has some texture artifacts not there on r600g nor llvmpipe.
Since the texture coords are calculated in the vertex shader it's possible the bug is in the interpolation?

"XORG-38398","[855GM] Dell Latitude D400 + Linux / BSD is living hell.","Dear developers

I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know my experiences running various Free- and open source operating systems on my Dell Latitude D400 (Centrino platform) laptop. 

This started when I wanted to run Ubuntu Maverick this didn't work and gave me a blank black screen on the Live CD. After some searching I found http://www.glasen-hardt.de who provided a working ISO with some fixed drivers. A kernel update broke it again and installing the patches manually broke too. What's more when the system worked I had various artifacts in the interface the most prominent being blacked-out contextual menu's.

On a working running system I upgraded to Natty which broke it again. A blank black screen right after X started.

Fed up I decided to try Fedora 15. This worked only in safe mode (i guess Vesa driver) and gave me only fallback in Gnome 3 a terrible compromise due to the 855GM being blacklisted.

Tired of my GNU/Linux troubles I decided to install PC-BSD 8.2 and guess what? Blank screen upon X initialization. 

I hate to tell you what the system is running right now but I think you can guess.

Will this be fixed or improve in the future or should I go looking for a new machine?",330,"1"

"SYSTEMD-90689","[PATCH] Add support for alienware gfx amplifier","Created attachment 116105
patch adding these keycodes

Some Alienware notebooks and desktops support an external graphics
housing called the Alienware Graphics Amplifier. It allows the usage
of a larger or more modern graphics card than your gaming PC would
already support.  In order to provide a good experience systems that
support it can provide notification to the OS via the scancodes on the
the keyboard controller of events related to the cable.

The following 4 events are supported (and the presumed OS response):
* Cable plugged in (An app on the existing display or terminal would
tell the user to reboot the system to activate)
* Undock cable pressed (An app would let the user know to reboot the
system to complete undock process also when supported by GFX driver
driver can clean up and work without a reboot)
* Surprise removal of cable (System reboots).

For the cable plug events I've mapped over to prog1/prog2.  If there is a better option for these please adjust accordingly.

The surprise removal of the cable causes the GPU drivers to get in a very bad state.  X continues to run  but plugging the cable back in or restarting X to use a different GPU doesn't fix it.
You can't tell the user to save their game status or anything else useful so it makes most sense to reboot or shutdown the machine.

I'm submitting a separate patch for the system reboot directly to the kernel via an i8042 filter.  In the event this is running on a kernel without that patch sending KEY_POWER is the next best thing as it would shutdown if the system DE was configured to do this.",20,"0"

---------------
* The driver now takes measures to prevent other DRM master processes
  (potentially from other local users) from accessing buffers created by
  this driver while switched away to a different VT. Other DRM master
  processes should only be able to access a single buffer anymore which
  contains only all-black pixels.

"XORG-7567","Xorg 7.0.0 fbdev + radeonfb == blank screen on Alpha","Overview Description:

Running the X server with fbdev configured in xorg.conf results in a blank
screen.  The Linux framebuffer driver being used is radeonfb.

Steps to Reproduce:

(1) Configure kernel with radeonfb as a built-in.
(2) Boot at any resolution supported by card+display.  In my case I've tried
both the default 640x480-8 resolution and 1024x768-16@70 (max. refresh rate my
monitor will support).
(3) Allow gdm to start via init scripts or login and run startx manually.

Actual Results:

Display switched to vt7 (first unused virtual terminal) went blank and then
did nothing further.

Expected Results:

Login screen for gdm case gnome desktop for startx case.

Build Date and Platform:

16 March 2006 on DEC PWS 433au (Alpha -- Miata) running Linux 2.6.18-rc[1-2] 

Additional Information:

System will boot successfully with radeonfb driver configured as a built-in.
When gdm starts the X server the display switches to vt7 blanks and then...
nothing.  System is still fully functional otherwise i.e. I can switch virtual
consoles with ctrl+alt+f1 and the console display is restored properly.  There's
no lock-up/freeze nor any Oops message.  Disabling gdm and running startx
manually results in the same behavior.

file. hpux in the scanfont includes eventually includes stdio.h which causes a
build failure.

The attached patch is a big hack. On hpux it #defines _STDIO_INCLUDED which is
the guard define to prevent multiple inclusion of /usr/include/stdio.h but it
does allow compilation to succeed.",1377,"1"
"PULSEAUDIO-68952","PA_STREAM_FIX_* flags do not work with pa_stream_new_extended()","1) Call pa_stream_new_extended() with two possible format one IEC61937-based and one PCM.
2) Call pa_stream_connect_playback() on the resulting stream with PA_STREAM_FIX_RATE flag.

If PulseAudio selects the IEC format it will fail with EINVAL. Thus there is no way to request fixed rate for the PCM format. Basically we would need separate sets of flags for the different formats.
