"GNOME-VFS-81076","fork() is not handled","gnome-vfs doesn't seem to handle fork().

It needs to use pthread_atfork() so that the mutexes are OK in the child
process (i.e. not locked forever). The glibc info docs contain a section
about this.


It also probably needs to do something about the job table and the state of
any operations underway. Maybe just clear them in the child process.


The other alternative is to say 'gnome-vfs will not work across a fork()'
which is OK as long as it is documented somewhere.

(Nautilus thumbnailing code seems to assume it does work across fork() at
present. Bug #78542 may be related to this.)",121,"0"

When a scan job is completed I try to click 'Forward'. However nothing happens.

Steps to reproduce:
1. launch gnomescan
2. scan a picture and wait for the scan job to be completed
3. click forward


Actual results:
nothing

Expected results:
I expect gnomescan to return to its home window. 

(In fact gnomescan shouldn't even have to wait until I hit the 'Forward' button it should just go to its main screen directly. I think this button can then be removed.)

Does this happen every time?
Yes

bindings for GNOME default Desktop have been moved
from the panel to Metacity. So these key bindings 
such as will no longer work because the callbacks

"GTK+-360225","Support for allowing GtkNotebook to drop tabs anywhere","Hi!

I've been sketching a patch to allow GtkNotebook drop tabs anywhere (not only in the root window). Although the patch somewhat works I feel some additions to gtk_drag_* would be welcome.

Issues with the patch:

- all the action happens in ::drag-end and internal flag is used to know whether the drag operation succeeded or not but it's not able to differ between when the drag failed and when the user cancelled the drag.

- To avoid the drag failed animation the code unmaps the drag window but:
  1) This won't work if the user sets a pixbuf or stock icon as the DnD icon
     (this behavior can be seen in tests/testnotebookdnd)
  2) we still have to wait for the animation timeout to happen
     before ::drag-end gets called.

My proposed solution would be to add a ::drag-failed signal emitted as soon as we know the drag failed and reporting the nature of the failure (no common target found GUI user cancelled timeout exceeded...) the API user could return TRUE in the handler to tell that the failure has been already handled (ie do not show animation) or FALSE to let the default implementation handle the failure.

of course ::drag-end would get called anyways and wouldn't be used for nasty things it wasn't thought for :)

Any suggestions?",83,"0"

"BANSHEE-345476","Preventing banshee from changing running playback","I have g-v-m set up to run banshee --dap %h when a portable media player device is attached to the system. This works really well for syncing a player... but in one case this is really annoying: Banshee is already running playing a playlist. I attach my mobile phone to get some photos from it. HAL will see it's media player capabilities and correctly run banshee --dap %h. Banshee is clever enough to not run another instance of itself but it will change to the DAP source and after the current song is played it will start plaing from the DAP.

It would be nice to have a flag like --dont-steal-running-process or however you want to call it which would prevent banshee to switch the source if the app is already running and another source is in use. If no banshee process was found we can assume that running banshee in DAP mode is ok so start up banshee then and change to the DAP source.",171,"0"

confusing itself as it says it cannot get exclusive access but when running

"GTK+-398336","'Desktop' location in 'Places' sidebar behaves erroneously","Please describe the problem:
When saving files the 'Places'-sidebar of the file chooser dialog doesn't correctly list its items in particular the Desktop item. Instead an empty selectable but broken item appears.

Navigating back and forth to some other directory usually lets the Desktop icon reappear.

I have taken a screenshot and put it on imageshack:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a GTK-application e.g. gedit
2. Select File --> Save As...
3. Click Browse for other folders

The Desktop icon in 'Places' should have vanished.

Actual results:


Expected results:
List and render the Places items correctly.

Yes.

When I'm listening to an internet radio stream and I want to stop it I click Pause.  Later when I want to continue I click Play (same button different label) and it plays OK for several seconds (out of the cache?) and then pops up a dialog box saying it can't play any more.

At this point the only way to get it to play again AFAICT is to choose Music->Open Location... and pick the latest URL again.


Steps to reproduce:
1. Start playing an internet stream (using Music -> Open Location...)
2. Click the pause button
3. Go eat lunch
4. Come back and click the play button


Actual results:
It will play for several seconds (maybe 10?) and then stop and throw a dialog box at me and refuse to play any more.

Expected results:
It would keep playing the stream (until I clicked pause again or asked it to play something else).

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

"GNOME-GAMES-SUPERSEDED-448431","API for GConf in libgames-support","gnome-games currently depend upon GConf for saving and loading preferences.
GConf in not available on win32 or the maemo platform.

So I think that we need a API in libgames-support which wraps functions for storing preferences in GConf or a config-file solution depending on the operating system.

Aisleriot already supports using either GConf or a config-file solution depending on which is available. Could the API in Aisleriot be generalized put in libgames-support and used by the other games as well?

See these files:
http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-games/trunk/aisleriot/conf.c?view=markup
http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-games/trunk/libgames-support/games-gconf.c?revision=5561&view=markup

That would ease porting all the games to mingw32/maemo. Of course it would also mean that most of the GConf API would have to be wrapped in libgames-support. I wonder if this has been done already elsewhere? ...",1,"0"

"DOXYGEN-309461","configure  seeks qt/qt2/qt3 in /usr/lib but in knoppix debian at /usr/share/qt? .","Please describe the problem:
Symptom: running configure gives a configure incompletable message  
that Qt is not found on the system.  
(Yet qt is part of KDE and obviously working both qt3 and qt2 apps.) 
Root of Problem:   
configure looks in /usr/lib and qt stuff looked for is in /usr/share 

Steps to reproduce:
1. in knoppix (3.6) debian (testing/unstable/stable) go to src where 
configure is 
2. ./configure (in bash) 
3.  
 

Actual results:
configure incompletable message that Qt is not found on the system.  
(Yet it's part of KDE and obviously working both qt3 and qt2 apps.) 
Problem:  configure looks in /usr/lib and qt stuff looked for is in /usr/share 

Expected results:
configure goes thru and then make and make install work. 

Does this happen every time?
yes until configure file is modified to look in /usr/share/qt* 

Other information:
perhaps a variable V = OR(lib share) could be introduced to cover the debian 
situation.  This line would be in this conditional: 
 
#- check for qt -------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
if test $f_wizard = YES then 
  if test -z $QTDIR then 
    echo   QTDIR environment variable not set! 
    echo -n   Checking for Qt... 
    for d in /usr/lib/{qt-3.1qt3qt2qtqt*} do 
      if test -d $d/lib -a -d $d/include -a -x $d/bin/moc then 
        QTDIR=$d 
      fi 
    done 
  else 
    echo   Detected Qt via the QTDIR environment variable... 
    echo -n                      
  fi 
 
The following worked (but doesn't cover the qt2 and qt conditionals that 
follow the qt3 check): 
 
#- check for qt -------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
echo Checking for Qt... 
  if test -z $QTDIR then 
    echo QTDIR environment variable not set. 
    echo Checking for Qt library... 
    if test -d /usr/lib/qt3/lib then 
      if test -d /usr/lib/qt3/include then 
        if test -x /usr/lib/qt3/bin/moc then 
          QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3 
        fi 
      fi 
    fi 
    # --- adapt for knoppix debian placement 
    if test -d /usr/share/qt3/lib then 
      if test -d /usr/share/qt3/include then 
        if test -x /usr/share/qt3/bin/moc then

If I play a video fullscreen and then come back to normal mode the video resolution changes.

Steps to reproduce:
1. open a video and play
2. press (f) for fullscreen
3. close fullscreen view

the video resolution changes from 1024x768 to 1280x1024

NB: 1280x1024 is the maximun resolution supported by my hw but I want to use 1024x768

"GTK+-378852","Fixes for notebook tab detaching","Hi!

I noticed a couple of small regressions in the GtkNotebook tab detaching functionality:

- tabs were not scrolling if a detached tab hovers the arrows the cause was that tabs in the notebook didn't have the focus. Fixed in gtk_notebook_do_arrow()

- if you drop the tab on arrows after some scrolling it causes the wrong tab to be deparented causing even a crash. This is fixed in gtk_notebook_stop_reorder()

- detaching a tab causes the source notebook to calculate tabs size strangely drawing incorrectly the box. Fixed in gtk_notebook_paint()

- when scrolling with a detached tab as the focus tab changes it gets drawn in 00. Fixed in gtk_notebook_calculate_tabs_allocation()

Apologies if the patch fixes many issues and you'd prefer them to be different bugs. I considered the changes are small/straighforward enough to send just one patch :)",32,"0"

GtkSearchEngineSimple uses threads to do the search the problem here is that it crashes with applications that hasn't called g_thread_init() for example tests/testfilechooser.

helps).  Since the mouse still works after this crash it is possible to

"EVOLUTION-209862","Evolution mailer suggestions...","Package: Evolution
Priority: Normal
Version: 0.12
Synopsis: Evolution mailer suggestions...
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
Just some suggestions for Evolution...

I'm using an IMAP mail account... I've made a shortcut to my IMAP inbox
on my shortcut bar but when Evolution starts up the link points to my
local inbox not the IMAP one... so I have to go through the folders to
my IMAP account type in my password have it retrieve the folders and
then go to my inbox... after this the shortcut to the IMAP inbox
works... it would be very useful to have the shortcut work without
having to go through all of the other steps...

Additionally I'm not sure if there are protocol issues but there are
many times when the mail clients simply sits there trying to accomplish
tasks but failing... right now it's simultaneously trying to send a
message and retrieve a message... it's sat here trying to do that for
five minutes... usually I have to close Evolution and start it up again
for this to work...

This also manifests itself sometimes when Evolution looks for new
headers... I'll read a message and then try to go to the next one... it
will sit there checking for new headers and not download the headers for
the message I'm trying to read... it just sits there...

Thanks for the product and I hope this helps...

This design isn't likely to ever work in many languages. Po files are hash
tables using the msgid as the key and thus all entries with the exact same

"RHYTHMBOX-373684","Race condition in Magnatune plugin","Please describe the problem:
When starting 2 downloads at the same time there is a race condition involving the XML parser objects that get the download location username password etc.

In __buy_track() self.__buy_album_handler and self.__auth_parser are initialized and then used again in __auth_read_cb() (data is fed into the parser and then variables are read from the BuyAlbumHandler object). If two downloads are started close enough to each other __buy_track() gets called before __auth_read_cb() is done using the parser objects and they get overwritten and Bad Things happen (the parser raises an exception about malformed XML).

The obvious solution would be to make self.__buy_album_handler and self.__auth_parser into local variables and pass them inside a tuple or list through the open and read calls. The problem is I can't figure out how to pass extra data with those calls and the python gnomevfs documentation doesn't have the async functions listed. I've looked at the C documentation but can't figure out how to properly pass the arguments.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Highlight tracks from 2 different albums
2. Click Purchase Album
3. Click Purchase in the 2 dialog boxes quickly

"EVOLUTION-248418","evolution segfault exposed by misserved IMAP message","http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2003/evolution-1.4.4-crash.mbox
evolution-1.4.4 segfaults when attempting to read this message served by
dovecot imap.  evolution does not crash when reading the same message from
uw-imapd or local folders.

I suspect that dovecot somehow mishandles this message which exposes this
segfault bug in evolution.  It also confuses other IMAP clients like
squirrelmail which is unable to read the message.  Mozilla mail is able to
read it however.

"GTK+-58920","can't undo gtk_menu_item_right_justify()","gtk_menu_item_right_justify () sets right_justify field of GtkMenuItem
instance to TRUE. But it's impossible to set it back to FALSE.

I see two different ways of fixing that.

1. Quick fix.
Add a parameter to gtk_menu_item_right_justify () and rename it to
gtk_menu_item_set_right_justify ():
	void        gtk_menu_item_set_right_justify     (GtkMenuItem *menu_item
gboolean is_true)
Calling gtk_menu_item_right_justify (item FALSE) will lead to setting
right_justify to FALSE.

The getter 
gboolean gtk_menu_item_get_right_justify (GtkMenuItem*) 
will be also necessary.


2. Not a quick fix.
Remove gtk_menu_item_right_justify () and add
void gtk_menu_item_set_justification (GtkMenuItem* item
GtkMenuItemJustification justification).

GtkMenuItemJustification is a new standard enumeration:
enum GtkMenuItemJustification
 typedef enum
 {
   GTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT
   GTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT
 } GtkMenuItemJustification

Used for justifying menu items.
 GTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT	The menu item is left-justified.
 GTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT	The menu item is left-justified.

The getter
GtkMenuItemJustification gtk_menu_item_get_justification (GtkMenuItem*)
will be also necessary.

I like the second way more but it requires more time.",14,"0"
"GFTP-117709","Transfers fail to complete with large files","When large files are transfered the transfers get into a endless loop
when the files are large.  The failing sizes are greater than 150MB.
Around 600MB files always fail.  The files appear to have completely
tranfered but gftp fails to recognize it and gftp tries to transfer
more of the file. So the remote server tells GFTP that is a bad offset

"GSTREAMER-637300","[API] request pad based on caps","We should add new API to core to make requesting pads based on caps possible (dynamically).

The normal way doesn't work for encodebin because it has quasi-dynamic pad templates that depend on the configured encoding profile but pad templates can't actually be dynamic and so in encodebin's case they only have ANY caps on them which means that code that wants to create a request pad for certain caps can't just iterate the templates and intersect to find the right template.

Wim suggested just creating a new template and setting the desired caps on that and passing that to the request pad vfunc implementation but I don't know of any request_pad_new implementations that expect such behaviour and don't assume that the pad template is one of the ones it set up before.

The easiest way would be to just create a new function/vfunc with an additional GstCaps * argument (and maybe deprecate the old one).

Alternatively one could go for just adding a new func/vfunc with direction+caps since template+name are most likely not of interest in this use case.",21,"0"
"GNOME-VFS-44693","Performance Problem with HTTP gnome-vfs","I was talking to Daniel Veillard on IRC and he gave an interesting pointer about
HTTP libraries.

They are usually slow because they do not set the TCP_NODELAY socket option (he
says it incurs about 200ms difference).

I look through the code in gnome-vfs-inet-connection.c
(gnome_vfs_inet_connection_create) and true to his word no TCP_NODELAY flag is set.

We should try setting this flag (using setsockopt) and seeing if this improves
HTTP performance.

I can test this myself in a couple of days (unless somebody wants to try it first)

Mike is checking this out working with Ali.

Investigating...



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2000-11-27 18:09:02 ----

Two fixes have gone in related to this issue:

(1) gnome-vfs http-method.c caches results of get_file_info's that are resolved
via a GET.  This allows the negative cache case to be used in do_open_directory
(I'm not a directory and no I'm not going to make a round-trip to tell you
that).  This increases web browsing performance a tiny bit

(2) Ammonite consolidates writes better.  This increases performance when
talking to eazel-services a tiny tiny bit.

Ali also notes that help: methods resulting from the DocBook filter appear much
faster than file: static HTML pages.  This could point to another web-browsing
related slow-down that isn't HTTP related.

I'm going to continue to do intermittent investigation on this bug.




------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2000-12-05 17:07:23 ----

I'm going to close this as FIXED.

I made several fixes (detailed above) to improve the situation.  The biggest
thing we can do is support HTTP/1.1 persistant connections.  I started the work
but I won't have a chance to finish it for 1.0.

it's just leaving them alone.

Required because this is a security hole I think.



------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2000-07-24 16:03:56 ----

Fixed so that changing owner or group on an executable file clears the SUID and
SGID bits as per explanation in man 2 chown.

"DOXYGEN-471766","Virtual destructor without return type gets virtual as type in the XML output","Please describe the problem:
Given a class with a number of virtual methods:

class C
{
public:
	C() {}
	virtual ~C() {}
	virtual f() { return 5 }
	virtual int g() { return 10 }
}

The XML output will list ~C() and f() as having virtual but g() has int. I would expect  for ~C() and f() to be empty and definitely not virtual.


Steps to reproduce:
1. Put the attached c++ and Doxyfile files in some dir
2. Run doxygen
3. Check XML output in xml/classC.xml


Actual results:


Expected results:


Does this happen every time?

"GNOME-PANEL-75072","Panel crashes on creating multiple floating panels","This bug is similar to bug #75070 only that this is even easier to 
reproduce.
I have a menu panel to start with.
Just keep creating creating multiple floating panels and panel crashes. 
Ofcourse sometimes you may have to create twenty or more floating panels 
before panel crashes.
I dont have any debugging symbols to attach but here is a list of warnings 
generated before panel crashed.

When using conduit 0.3.4 on Debian Sid 2.6.22-3-686 I cannot access the login for Box.net. The only parameter I can access is the name of the synchronisation folder. Therefore the synchronisation does not happen and the Box.net box shows Error Refreshing.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Dataprovider box for Box.net
2. Double-click on it.


Actual results:
The only accessible parameter is the folder.

Expected results:
One should be able to access the login parameters and the folder.

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

"DIA-470926","cairo export to png displaces imported images","Please describe the problem:
When I export my diagrams in dia to png the location (xy) of my custom icons/images is displaced from what it was in the original diagram.  There seems to be a trend in how much the images are displaced relative to each other a visible pattern that is.  This problem does not seem to arise when exporting to JPEG but I use PNG for preservation of image quality/size.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new dia document
2. Import a picture or two (mine were small png icons/images)
3. Save as a png format picture


Actual results:
When exported to .png any icons that were imported images should be displaced.  Mine were displaced to the right.

Expected results:
When exported to .png any icons that were imported images should be displaced.  Mine were displaced to the right.  I created a new file and came up with the same results.

Does this happen every time?
Yes

Other information:
This only seems to happen with images I import to use with my diagram.  I've mainly used this on Windows but tried it on Linux - same result with the 0.96.1 version.  On Windows the 0.95.x version I have does not displace the images I've imported to the file I'm exporting.  Please contact me for an example both a .dia file and my exported .png file.  Thanks I hope this is resolved before I need to turn in my project!  Nah I'll just export to something else - thanks again.",18,"0"

characters were Ê (character code 0xCA) and were displayed at the third
position from the left in the ASCII side and between the first and second
positions in the hex side.
These characters do not actually appear in the file itself and GHex is not
altering the file. The effect is purely visual. Browsing the file via other
measures than the arrow buttons gets rid of the characters.

"FILE-ROLLER-125844","MIME information should differenciate between .zip and .jar","Package: file-roller
Severity: normal
Version: 2.4.1
Synopsis: MIME information should differenciate between .zip and .jar
Bugzilla-Product: file-roller
Bugzilla-Component: general

Description:
Description of Problem:

in $PREFIX/mime-info/file-roller.mime I read

application/zip
        ext: zip jar ear war

Consequently if file roller is installed Nautilus indiscriminately
regards jar files as normal zip files.  
Hence it is impossible to seperately customize what I want to happen if
I click on a jar file.

This is wrong. jar archives should be application/x-java-archive not
application/zip. (The global GNOME mime information has got that right
but file-roller's mime info overrides that.)

When I click a zip file I certainly expect file-roller to be launched
but for jar files I want that to be only an option the first choice
being that the jar file is launched with java -jar $FILE

Therefore I highly recommend to move the extension jar from
application/zip and to application/x-java-archive.

Patch for the issue

BIO_meth_* functions return 1 on success however they're checked against 0 causing BIO_g_tls() to return NULL which is unchecked by the caller resulting in a null pointer access and consequently crash.

The simple patch I've attached fixes this problem by simply inverting the condition. Tested on Linux only but I don't see why it shouldn't work on other systems as well.

"F-SPOT-335935","Export to folder bugs when pictures bear same name","Please describe the problem:
The export to folder feature uses file names based on the image name. If one is
to export pictures with same file name (but of course different paths) the last
one to be exported clobbers the others. The filename is desirable as it is
sometimes based on the topic of the image and is memory-friendly for url
(look this is at http://something/photos/funny_face.jpg) but this prevents
having pictures with the same base name to be exported together (and all of my
panoramic pictures built with Hugin use panoramic1.jpg panoramic2.jpg...
beginning at 1 for each photo session).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open f-spot select pictures that have the same name on disk
2. Export them to Folder
3. Open index.html


Actual results:
Index shows only one picture in multiple copies.

Expected results:
Index shows many pictures in one copy each.

Does this happen every time?
Yes

Other information:
Patch included. Rationale for using (DbItem).Id as complement to the image is as
follows: when using more complex export destinations image name should probably
be a constant therefore not something based on the order in which the photos
were selected or with which photos they were selected. Something dependent on
the complete path would be too long. The id in the db looks fine. Could be
printed in hex form to make it shorter (or in base 36 mapped to 0-9a-z). Patch
applies cleanly after applying patch for #335929 will be fuzzy else (only line
numbers changed).",122,"0"

That's exactly what for the library is called libxml++-3.0.so.0 => the .0 at the end indicates the ABI version.. if it's incompatible it has to be changed to 1 - later if again incompatible to .2

This is so that apps that are linked against one ABI version do not just start to crash when not being rebuilt against the new library... they will either load the old lib that might still exist on the system (because they link to the .0) or they fail with a missing library hopefully already caught by a proper package manager.",20,"0"

This sounds like a packaging issue. I don't know why oaf would even be involved
while installing with apt-get. Please report this bug to your package vendor.

This is really a lame answer. When a bug is reported the developer handling it
should report as needed to 
outside units for resolution then update the status as needed in bug report so
that users may cross-reference.

I have been trying to find out if Debian is even aware of this and have been
unable to verify it. 

I am currently unable to even open Nautilus in Debian using the latest available
debs on the red-carpet site and it is now July 4th. This bug was reported in
April! Someone neeeds to take ownership of this or at least update this record.



------- Additional Comments From mjs@noisehavoc.org 2001-07-04 11:48:27 ----

Hi

I'm sorry but you need to report this bug to Ximian. I can't take
responsibility for package installation problems. I am not going to report
a bug to Ximian myself because (a) I am not the one experiencing the packaging
problem and (b) I don't even have a Debian system to try this on (and if I did
I wouldn't even want to install Ximian GNOME).




------- Additional Comments From d92-jwa@nada.kth.se 2001-07-05 00:14:12 ----

The packaging problem has been reported (and apparently resolved) here:
http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2462.

The assertion failure is obviously an error with whatever program that owns
oaf-activate.c.  If it wasn't an error in the code it wouldn't trigger an
assertion.  As it is an error I think it should be fixed but that's not really
for me to decide.

Anyway as the original reporter of this bug I personally don't care about it
anymore but others may.  See the discussion at Ximian's bugzilla for a workaround.



------- Additional Comments From mjs@noisehavoc.org 2001-07-05 00:18:27 ----

If the analysis in the Ximian bug report is correct the problem is that getting
gconf using apt-get gets liboaf but not the package which contains oafd (on
Debian they are separate). The assertion failure is because liboaf tries to
launch oafd and does not find it a situation that comes up only when you have a
broken install. Nontheless I'll improve the error reporting in this case.

Adjusting summary and reopening...




------- Additional Comments From mjs@noisehavoc.org 2001-08-08 01:46:31 ----

OK so with Havoc's exception reporting improvements you now get this message
which I believe fixes the problem of a meaningful error message:

Eel-WARNING **: nautilus(5414): GConf error:
  Object Activation Framework error:
 OAF problem description: 'Failed to execute oafd: 2 (No such file or
directory)'





------- Additional Comments From d92-jwa@nada.kth.se 2001-08-08 01:56:32 ----

As the original reporter I thought I should chime in and tell you I'm quite
happy with this solution.  Thanks a bunch!



------- Additional Comments From mjs@noisehavoc.org 2001-08-08 01:59:34 ----

Don't thank me thank Havoc he did most of the work of improving exception
reporting (though I made some changes in this area too).

"GPARTED-340320","tib backup files produced by Acronis True Image Home are zeroed","Please describe the problem:
I use Acronis TI9 Home to make full disk backups in dvd sized chunks (tib
files). I have two WD 160Gb hard drives and a WD 320Gb firewire connected backup
drive.
I backup the harddrives to folders hda & hdb on the first partition (sda1 vfat)
and I make a safety backup of hda to a folder hda-tibs on the D drive (hdb).
A backup image consists of between 3 and 5 tib files. A week ago all EXCEPT the
last tib file in each image set were zeroed! 

I should mention that besides XP Home I have 3 Gentoo copies a Kanotix- and a
Slax-poormans install to hdb and a Wolvix LiveCD saving changes to hdb.

The problem occurred again yesterday and again today after I activated Gparted
in Wolvix. Finally this evening simply by using the latest Gparted LiveCD..

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run up the LiveCD I used Vesa driver 16 bit 'no' keyboard US English.
2. Gparted couldn't find any disks so I rebooted into Gentoo
3. Checked sda1 - zeroed tib files on sda1 AND hdb10 (D drive)


Actual results:
Well until today I have had little success getting to a desktop with earlier
versions of your LiveCD. Today I got there saw the GUI but the progress bar
went back & forth looking for disks. Didn't find any.. see 2 and 3 above.

Expected results:
I would expect the usual Gparted screen to show my disk status at least.

Does this happen every time?
It takes me a few hours to backup both drives so I haven't tried it again yet
but I will by tomorrow afternoon.

Other information:
a) None of my other files have been affected. 
b) A bunch of fsck000x.rec files are produced when the files are zeroed.",695,"1"

Original description:

Go to a party!

Take some photos during the evening.

Stay up beyond midnight taking more photos.

Get home sleep recover.

In the morning import your photos into shotwell.

Observe the format of the date from your photos is somewhat obscure.

E.g.

Fri 4 Nov -5 2011

I realise this means photos taken from 4th to 5th November but the format
is somewhat bizarre.

Perhaps any of the following:-

4-5 Nov 2011

4th to 5th Nov 2011

Fri 4 - Sat 5 Nov 2011

#2

Updated by Adam Dingle over 1 year ago

  * **Assignee** set to _Clinton Rogers_
  * **Priority** changed from _Normal_ to _High_
  * **Target version** set to _0.12.2_

Thanks for the bug report. Alan what locale are you in?

We should fix this for 0.12.2.

####

#3

Updated by Lucas Beeler over 1 year ago

Alan:

Just to follow up on what Adam asked: are you using Shotwell in Commonwealth
English as opposed to US English?

Clinton:

If Alan is running in Commonwealth English I think this is probably an error
in the strftime strings in the en_GB.po file. This is good because it
requires no code changes whatsoever to fix. This sounds like a good bug for
you too because I know you like spelling color as colour anyway. -)

For en_GB users date ranges spanning exactly two days should display as

now.

#5

Updated by Bruce Cowan over 1 year ago

Translation comments should be added to those strings because I didn't
realise they were special range ones.

####

#6

Updated by Alan Pope over 1 year ago

I'm using en_GB or Commonwealth English as you call it :D

####

#7

Updated by Adam Dingle over 1 year ago

  * **Status** changed from _5_ to _Open_
  * **Resolution** deleted (_fixed_)

We should do two more things here:

  1. Add translation comments as Bruce suggested.
  2. Audit these strings in all other languages to make sure that the bug doesn't occur there.

Reopening.

"EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-354923","Evolution does not store protocol in keyring entries","Please describe the problem:
I have one account which uses SMTP AUTH for sending mail. Everytime I send mail the Authentication Dialog pops up and asks for the SMTP AUTH Password after entering the correct password everything works fine.

This could be happening because the SMTP Server runs on a different port: 8025

So my SMTP Server is configured as:
mail.server.com:8025

I'll attach a screenshot of the keyring.



Steps to reproduce:
1. Configure a SMTP Server using SMTP Auth
2. Send a mail
3. Authentication dialog pops up you can save the password but it's not remembered for the next session


Actual results:
Authentication dialog pops up every evolution session

Expected results:
The mail should be sent right away using the credentials stored in gnome-keyring-manager

Does this happen every time?
yes ervery new evo session

"EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-699597","Autocomplete using GAL is slow","If I switch to the Contacts pane in the UI and do a simple 'Name contains...' search in the GAL it's very fast. But an 'Any field contains...' search takes about 12 seconds. That's expected since the latter is searching fields that aren't in the database summary.

However: if I enter a partial name/address into the To: field in the composer it takes the *same* 12 seconds to come up with a list of possible completions.
That's less acceptable.

I'm guessing that the autocomplete query is trying to match on some field that *isn't* in the sqlitedb summary and thus it's falling back to the slow search that builds *all* the VCARDs and runs the search over them all.

Whatever the default autocomplete in the composer is doing we should make sure those fields are indexed...",524,"1"

furthermore the function to add songs is labeled add. the opposite of add is
remove and not delete.

Severity: major
Version: GNOME2.1.90 0.20
Synopsis: Tetravex starts the game already solved
Bugzilla-Product: gnome-games
Bugzilla-Component: gnotravex
Description:
Description of Problem:
Tetravex doesn't shuffle the tiles when starting a new game
when the board size = 4x4 or 2x2. This kind of ruins the game :)

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Start Tetravex
2. Settings -> 2x2 or 4x4
3. New Game

Actual Results:
The tiles on the right lie in the order in which they are to be placed
on the left.

Expected Results:
The tiles on the right lie in random order.

How often does this happen?
Always.

------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-02-22 17:06:41 ----

We are pretty sure that this broke recently with changes to when 
load_directory is called. The directory view isn't catching the load_directory 
error and thus isn't reporting it to the user. I think we can live with this 
broken though it makes me sad. (It's not a regression from PR3 because 
this behavior was changed after PR3 when bug 45157 was fixed.



------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-03-02 06:45:31 ----

There's some more discussion of the current flaky behavior in bug 40546.



------- Additional Comments From brett@eazel.com 2001-03-02 10:46:42 ----

Verified (due to bug 45157) that this should not be considered a regression
despite my comments in bug 40546.

Rhythmbox creates MPEG4 AAC audio and puts it on the device - my device does not even support MPEG4 AAC only MP3.

Also the encoded file comes out about 4 times as long as it should be with gaps at regular intervals maybe 4 gaps every 3 seconds. It seems the whole audio is encoded but there's so many gaps in it it causes the file to be 4 times too long.

Also the metadata for the file shows up in duplicates. For a FLAC file with artist Daniel Kandi and a title Child the song shows up as Child Child in the title column and Daniel Kandi Daniel Kandi in the artist column. The Nautilus property page for the file says the same (Child Child etc.) I guess the metadata isn't being added correctly.",15,"0"
"GOSSIP-426464","If you disconnect during a chat your contact will stay offline even after reconnection","To reproduce this bug you must use Gossip 0.23 with network-manager.

1. Launch Gossip and start a conversation with an online buddy
2. Without closing the chat window disable the network with network-manager
3. Notice that your contact is offline (you are offline)
4. Re-enable the network. Gossip will automatically reconnect itself
5. Notice that in the chat window your contact is still offline !
6. If your contact send you a message (for example : You disconnected ? What happened ?) the message will not appear in the opened chat window.

Instead you will have to open a new chat window which will contain the same history as the other window. You will then end with 2 chat windows for the same buddy one that shows you your buddy offline the other that shows its true status.

This bug is specially annoying when chatting with multiple buddies on an unreliable connection : you will have to close and reopen each window after each disconnection.",0,"0"

"BLUEFISH-328459","Bluefish crashes seemingly randomly after some use","Steps to reproduce:
I can't reproduce the bug. It occurs seemingly randomly after some use. Here is
what has caused the crash so far:

1) I indented about 20 lines of text several times in quick succession. CPU was
under severe load when it happened. I could not reproduce the event.

2) Tried changing background colour for a highlighting parameter. Applied
changes and hit F5 to update. On hitting F5 bluefish crashed. Again cannot
reproduce.

3) Selected and deleted about 5 chars of text.
  
I wonder if undo buffer is maxing out.

So far I've not had any luck getting a back-trace. As soon as I get one I'll
post it.

I actually didn't know that we are returning  for HAN in pango_script_get_sample_language().  This is definitely suboptimal.  First we can at least return Chinese.  That definitely works better than the current situation.

Even better we can return (probably in a new API) a list of languages.  zhjako for example.  Fontconfig already knows about this kind of usage:

"EVOLUTION-325763","omf file for evolution documentation has wrong category","Forwarded from: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=21172

The evolution documentation appears under Applications but in my opinion it
should be in Applications -> Internet. This effect can be achieved by modifying
the category line in the file /usr/share/omf/evolution/evolution-2.4-C.omf so
that it reads:

    

I would also recommend giving it a more user-friendly  including what
the application does rather than just its name. For example:

    
      Guide to using the Evolution email client
    

This _could_ be done upstream but I am unsure about whether they would be
prepared to do that. In any case please do it in Ubuntu.

Severity: normal

Bugzilla-Product: nautilus
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0



Name: ksC78424			Date: 12/18/2002



Bug filed by muktha.narayan@wipro.com

I'm running sources from fcs-07.
1. Invoke nautilus.
2. Move some file/folder to trash.
3. Go to the trash folder and click on the file/folder.
4. Invoke the 'Edit' menu by pressing 'Alt+E' (and not by clicking on
the Edit menu)
5. Press 'D' to delete from trash.
6. A dialog pops up with the message 'Are you sure you want to
permanently delete  from the Trash?
This dialog is not keynavigable. Tabbing does not work and 'Delete'
button doesnot have a mnemonic and hence the user cannot delete the file
with the keyboard.
7. Alt+tab (or any other metacity shortcut)  doesnot work. Clicking
anywhere else on the desktop does not have any effect.

Note: This behaviour is noticed only for the 'Trash' folder .

"GTK+-527466","gtk_assistant_set_current_page records wrong visited page","Please describe the problem:
The function gtk_assistant_set_current_page records the next current page as the last visited page instead of the actual current page.

Steps to reproduce:
See the attached example program.


Actual results:
Press Enter to activate the text entry then click the back button.  An empty page is presented.

Expected results:
The first page of the assistant should be presented instead.

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

Other information:
See attached patch.

Note: The function gtk_assistant_set_current_page is intended to be used by custom buttons added to the action area.  This works to simulate the forward button but it can not be used to simulate the back button which affects the visited pages list differently (it removes rather than adds a page) and which needs to access the content of the visited pages list.

I suggest to add a mechanism to allow to trigger the default buttons in the action area programmatically.

Also I want to suggest to implement a function similar to gtk_dialog_set_default_response.  In fact I was kind of surprised that an assistant is not sub-classed from a dialog but I am not an expert in toolkit design.",0,"0"

"GNOME-PANEL-401481","Kill gnome panel makes floating notification area","Please describe the problem:
Running killall gnome-panel (or otherwise abruptly closing the panel) while icons are in the notification area makes for floating icons of anything in the notification area.  Even after gnome-panel restart those icons (e.g. from gnome-power-manager status) will remain floating although NEW notification icons will behave correctly.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Put something in the notification area
2. killall gnome-panel
3. 


Actual results:
Floating notification icons (usually upper left of screen)

Expected results:
No floating icons

Does this happen every time?
Yes

I've created a calendar entry in a calendar called work.  I want to move to another called Personal (both are local to this machine).  Normally I open the calendar event and select the new calendar.  What happens is that I get 2 popups one saying that evo can't open calendar work and the other that it can't open calendar Personal.

Steps to reproduce:

"NETWORKMANAGER-491795","Also ask for DNS info for static routes","When setting up a static connection (no DHCP) it would be nice if the user had the option to specify the contents of /etc/resolv.conf for that connection. This will help folks who use networks with no DHCP such as SOHO installations. Like mine.

The current code leaves the /etc/resolv.conf from the previous network in place which may or may not work. To folk not familiar with DNS it will appear to be an intermittent failure.

At a minimum it would be nice to be able to set up to three servers' IP addresses and a search line (e.g. search foo.bar.baz.com bar.baz.com snark.org).

Cutting and pasting the contents of an existing /etc/resolv.conf is fine for us hackers but probably more freeform than most users want. I would suggest a simple dialog box with detailed tool tips.

"GTKMM-91033","gtkmm2 win32 compile errors","gtkmm2 compilation has some problems with MinGW/Cygwin environment.

 1. The compilation fails at libpangomm link stage because libtool
    cannot generate the import library of libglibmm DLL.
    The cause is a limitation of impgen.exe utility of libtool 1.4.2.
    impgen.exe cannot treat the anonymous namespace symbols correctly.
    It can be solved by removing all anonymous namespaces.

 2. Some sources need to be fixed.

    * gtk/gtkmm/menu_elems.cc compilation fails at line 28 because
      strings.h doesn't exist.

    * libgtkmm link fails because gtk/gtkmm/wrap_init.cc includes
      Plug and Socket codes. They are not supported under win32 platforms.

 3. 'make install' fails because it doesn't install the import libraries.
    For example glib/glibmm/Makefile.am should include the following
    targets.

Package: nautilus
Severity: enhancement
Version: GNOME2.6.1 2.6.x
Gnome-Distributor: Gentoo Linux
Synopsis: Feature Request: Close Folders Recursively
Bugzilla-Product: nautilus
Bugzilla-Component: Accessibility
Bugzilla-Version: 2.6.x
Description:
Please describe your feature request:

Hi I would like to have this feature in the future versions of
nautilus - Close Folders Recursively

The current spatial mode is very nice especially for my dad and mom who have little knowledge about computer. And I love it too.

However it's a little bit annoying to close a lot of windows one by one if I go deeply in some directories.

I would like to see a feature like: 

. right-click on the window border there will be a menu item
Close Recursively or so.
. click it then it closes itself and all of its parent parent's
parent... all top level opened folders.

or:
. add one more tiny button to the right-top of a nautilus window aside with those minimize enlarge close buttons. Name it close recursively then we could click it to close a lot of folders immediately!

That would be very cool and make the nautilus spatial mode better!

"EVOLUTION-399622","Memory usage grow by 65MB to open 1MB plain text mail.","Please describe the problem:
Memory usage of Evolution grow by 65MB just to open the attached 1MB mail plain text format with list of kernel files.

Steps to reproduce:
Using Slackware 11.0 + up-to-date Dropline Gnome 2.16.2:
1. Make sure sendmail is running.
2. Run the command below changing yourusername with your real username:
find /usr/src/linux/ -print | mail -s List of kernel source files yourusername@localhost
3. Run Evolution. Open one terminal window run top and look at memory usage of Evolution (131MB by the example below):

   PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND                                           
 3202 mateus    15   0  131m  27m  18m S  0.0  5.4   0:07.12 evolution-2.8            

4. Select File/Import follow the steps and select the file /var/spool/mail/yourusername of type MBOX. Import to the message folder of your choice.
5. Select the message you generated with the command above to open it at the preview pane.

Actual results:
Run top sort by memory usage and look for evolution process:
   PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND                                           
 3202 mateus    15   0  196m  90m  18m S  0.0 17.9   0:20.25 evolution-2.8                            

So 196 - 131 = 65MB of memory required to open a plain text format mail (size of 1MB).

Expected results:
Memory usage should not grow too much when the message is
opened/displayed.

Does this happen every time?
Yes but starting with different amount of memory (after grows by almost the same quantity of this example).

"GEDIT-PLUGINS-382937","Filebrowser plugin loads slowly - nautilus bookmarks on unavailable resources","Please describe the problem:
I noticed that the time to startup gedit was very long I timed it to around 20 seconds. I tried disabling all plugins after that gedit starts almost instantly. I found that the offending plugin is the Filesystem browser pane when I enable it in the preference dialogue it freezes gedit and after about 20 seconds it starts responding again.

I then found that I have a nautilus bookmark where the target is an sftp:// url where the server is currently unavailable. When clicking this bookmark in nautilus it incidentally takes around 20 seconds for nautilus to come to the conclusion that the target is unreachable displaying the dialog box stating that the resource is not available. I then removed this bookmark and the Filesystem browser pane plugin loads instantly.

So it would seem that the plugin tries to access the bookmarks when loading which would explain this behavior.

Also gedit stopped responding to user input when I added such a bookmark when gedit was running with the plugin loaded. It repainted all widgets but did not respond to any input.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add an sftp:// bookmark in nautilus pointing to a server that is unreachable.
2. Start gedit and enable the filesystem browser pane plugin

The build fails on systems that do not have libtool installed.

disconnected... and so..

beagled waste a lot of time indexing this directory and the information there is
not useful for the users. I think this folders be excluded from the crawling in

this is a tracking meta bug for keyboard shortcuts / key kombinations (with

this is NOT about requests / reports about missing menu entries or
places where a menu item shout be placed instead of the current place (so
usability) - see meta tracking bug 310550 for this.

this is also NOT about mnemonics (the line under one character of a menu entry

"F-SPOT-525246","Import dialog is confusingly empty by default","F-Spot 0.4.2 Ubuntu Hardy beta

When F-Spot's Import dialog first opens it begins with an Import Source menu set to Select Folder but this is followed by two empty panes neither of which contain any folders to select.

(The behavior of the Import Source menu is also confusing in that Select Folder is selected by default and does not end in an ellipsis but when reselected it opens a dialog for further input.)

This bug would be fixed if there is no longer an Import window with panes that are all empty by default. This might be achieved by either:

*   abolishing the entire Import dialog replacing it with items for detected
    cameras in the Sidebar of F-Spot's main window with the remaining File >
    Import… item going directly to a filepicker

*   converting the Import Source menu into a new left pane in the Import

Steps to reproduce:
1. Insert a usb stick
2. Create a file on it
3. Move the file to the trash
4. Empty the trash
5. Tell nautilus to empty the trash when it asks


Actual results:
Nautilus empties the trash

Expected results:
Nautilus asks again whether you'd like to empty the trash after you've already told it you do

Yes

"GLADE-LEGACY-107450","X11 dependency in editor.c","Description of Problem:
GDK/X11 dependancy in editor.c causing an error 
while compiling a GDK/DirectFB port.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Install GDK/DirectFB.
2. Configure Glade using --disable-gnome --
disable-gnome-db
3. Make

Actual Results:
Error compiling editor.c:
- gdk/gdkx.h not found
- clear_child_windows will not compile 

How often does this happen? 
Always.

Additional Information:
If I comment the relevant parts out I guess the 
same as for _WIN32 then it will compile. But the 
drawing is ugly it does not always erase the 
background of controls.

It seems that XGetWindowAttributes needs to 
be 'translated' to a similar call in GDK.",221,"0"

After restarting epiphany after a crash the pages wouldn't load anymore. Clearlooks/cairo shows that it's hanging trying to draw things. Switching to Bluecurve as the theme made the pages appear straight away.

I'm pretty sure that we end up moving files if a file name with path separators is

Evolution uses weak encryption when sending mail via SSL/TLS.

(using TLSv1 with cipher RC4-MD5 (128/128 bits))

I consider this a serious bug as RC4-MD5 is definitly not a good idea.
Manually connecting via 'openssl s_client' to the server I used for testing shows:
 SSL-Session:
     Protocol : TLSv1
     Cipher : DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA

So it definitly works on the server-side.

1. Send mail via a TLS/SSL-enabled mailserver

"GDM-342831","gdm could provide -nodaemon option for compatibility","Hi

A couple of weeks ago GDM lost the -nodaemon option when it transitioned over to using GOption.  This ended up causing problems in Fedora because our init scripts passed the old option and so GDM daemonized on start up.

This causes problems because we have code to watch for it to exit and restart it automatically.  Since it daemonizes it exits immediately and we end up restarting it over and over again in a tight loop causing the user's CPU usage to jump to 100%.

See http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=192461 for more details.

One potential solution would have been to change our initscripts to use --nodaemon instead of -nodaemon.  This would be a bit awkward because we use the same scripts for KDM and XDM and they only supported the one-dash variant of -nodaemon.

Another option would be to add support back to GDM for -nodaemon.  Arguably the command line interface of GDM is part of it's API so it would be nice if it still supported the -nodaemon option for backward compatibility with itself and XDM.",0,"0"

"EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-261454","Groupwise sending mail issues","from sean kirby. per conversation with JP we need to address IMMEDIATELY
post2.0.


Evolution currently appears to make three assumptions about the sending
host when the Server Type is set to Novell GroupWise:

1) The sending SMTP agent is on the same host as the IMAP and GW-SOAP agent
(the POA).

2) The sending SMTP agent is configured as an open relay (i.e. no
authentication is required in order to relay).

3) The sending SMTP agent supports SSL-encrypted communication to the same
degree as the POA i.e. if the POA requires the use of SSL then the SMTP
agent also requires it or if it's optional for the POA then it's optional
for the SMTP agent etc.

The problem is that when you select the Sending Server Type as Novell
GroupWise there is no UI for indicating that the SMTP agent might be on a
different host (which it probably will be for most GW shops) or that the
sending host requires authentication in order to relay or that SSL
is/isn't required/available etc.

In my testing even though I have provided a user ID and password for use
with GW-SOAP and IMAP if the sending server is Novell GroupWise I
cannot relay messages. Evolution assumes authentication is not required. If
I try to send a message that should be forwarded to a remote domain I get
an error indicating that relaying is denied (if the SMTP agent forbids
unauthenticated relaying).

Because there is no UI it appears that Evolution will either assume that
authentication is required to relay or it will assume that it is not
required (i.e. the user can't specify one or the other). Currently it
appears to assume that authentication is NOT required. 

In addition consider that most GW shops will likely use GWIA as the SMTP
Agent. One reason for this is that GWIA uses the same authentication
database that the POA uses so the authentication criteria for relaying
SMTP messages is the same as for retrieving e-mail and calendar data.

However consider that shops that have both GWIA and POA are more likely to
run them on separate hosts than they are to run them on the same host.
Currently there is no UI to specify that the Novell GroupWise SMTP agent
is on a different host - Evolution assumes that it's on the same host as
the POA. This is going to frustrate some (most?) admins. Especially when
you consider that shops with multiple GW post offices are likely to have
each PO on a different host and they are likely to have only one GWIA for
the entire organization.

My recommendations based on my knowledge of our own customer base are:

1) Don't assume the SMTP agent is running on the same host as the POA. More
often than not it won't be. Allow users to specify a sending host address
if you want to simplify account creation perhaps default the sending host
address to the same address that is used for receiving. But it must be
modifiable.

2) Allow users to specify whether or not the sending host requires
authentication to relay. If you want to simplify it you can safely assume
that the authentication credentials are the same as for IMAP/GW-SOAP (as
long as they specify Novell GroupWise as the sending host type) and you
can safely assume that the authentication method is Login but as to
whether or not authentication is required that should be configurable.

3) I did notice that the SSL setting is also assumed to be the same. Given
that the SMTP agent and the POA aren't necessarily running on the same box
I don't know if this is a safe assumption. It is a reasonable one as it
would be reasonable to implement SSL on all hosts involved but then not
all admins/shops do things reasonably! Again you could default to the same
SSL setting as the receiving host (when creating a new account) but it
should still be configurable.

The problem I have is that I have already submitted the article and they
are already laying out the issue so if any of these things are going to
change I have to make modifications (if I even can) and get them submitted
pronto. Currently the article specifies that if yo select Novell
GroupWise as the sending host your SMTP agent must run on the same host
as the POA and your SMTP agent must NOT forbid open relaying since you
can't configure authentication. In addition the article specifies that if
the sending host is configured as Novell GroupWise the SMTP agent must
support the same SSL requirement that the POA supports.

If these statements are going to be incorrect when 2.0 comes out (b/c they
are NOT incorrect at present) I need to know quickly so I can change the
article. Also I could use more information on how setting the sending host
type to Novell GroupWise makes it possible to track statuses and retract
etc.  As of right now it appears to me that there is no benefit to
choosing this host type and the limitations it presents (as described
above) lead one to think that Novell GroupWise should NOT be chosen as
the server type.
 
So if you could help me know how these things are going to be finalized
that would be great!",15,"0"

"EPIPHANY-325155","Epiphany forgets changes in key accelerators","Please describe the problem:
I tried removing the select all accelerator (ctrl-A) so I can use that
combination to go to the beginning of the line but Epiphany keeps forgetting
the change after every restart.

Note that I always kill the epiphany process to keep some sites opened so I
don't know if this affects the outcome. Still I expect this change to be kept
independently of the method use to close the application.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Make sure that key accelerator editing is enabled. Go to desktop |
preferences | toolbars & menus (I'm translating sorry) and set the editable
menu accelerators option.
2. Give focus to the Edit | Select All menu item in Epiphany.
3. Press backspace or delete to remove the binding.
4. Restart Epiphany. I normally kill the process instead of quitting the
application from the File menu.



Actual results:
When you go back to Edit | Select All you should see that the accelerator you
removed in step 2 is back there.

Expected results:
The change is kept between sessions.

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

Daniel Leidert reported in Debian bug http://bugs.debian.org/373643 that his source tree isn't buildable with intltool 0.35.0 anymore as it now relies on DATADIRNAME being defined when configure runs.  The relevant source tree is accessible with CVS at :pserver:chemical-mime.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/chemical-mime.

DATADIRNAME seems to be defined by GLIB_WITH_NLS.

It's also not very clear why intltool's macros use a construct like $(prefix)/$(DATADIRNAME)/locale.

I suggest you copy the relevant GLIB_WITH_NLS snippet which computes DATADIRNAME to be share everywhere and lib on Solaris and define a new itlocaledir directory in intltool.m4.

"GOK-127296","GOK compose keylabels bad with XFree 4.3","This seems to depend on the version of XFree being used...GOK is OK with
4.2 but 4.3 is very broken indeed.

GOK is calling XkbTranslateKeysym which in older XFree returns a valid
UTF-8 string for the keycap.  But in 4.3 it returns an ASCII string
_describing_ the keysym so instead for instance of '£' it returns
sterling instead of the correct symbol for e with an accent acute it
returns eacute etc.

This is very bad indeed for GOK's XKB-generated keyboards.",20,"0"

"PITIVI-381959","Pressing Alt-F to activate file menu toggles fullscreen","Please describe the problem:
Pressing Alt-F while focus is in the main pitivi window opens the File menu as expected but also toggles the application into (or out of) fullscreen mode.

Pressing F on its own toggles fullscreen mode as expected.

This is because the key-press-event signal is connected to with connect() instead of connect_after().

Steps to reproduce:
1. Press Alt-F while focus is in the main pitivi window.

Actual results:
File menu opens and applications toggles to fullscreen mode.

Expected results:
File menu opens.

Does this happen every time?
Yes

"GSTREAMER-166696","[build] Doesn't support 386 or Cyrix CPU","Version details: Debian's 0.8.8-1
Distribution/Version: Debian/sid

Hi

Richard Mortimer reported in Debian bug  a SIGILL
in libgstreamer0.8 it seems this happened because of a cpuid instruction in
gst_cpuid_i386() gst/gstcpu.c.

According to  it seems one
should follow a longer PATH to get an idea of the available CPU:
- first check whether AC flag in EFLAGS is writable if it isn't you're on a 386
and you shouldn't think of calling CPUID
-then run the following assembly code to check for a Cyrix CPU:
        movl    $0x5555 %eax
        xorl    %edx %edx
        movl    $2 %ecx
        clc
        divl    %ecx
        jnc     you_have_Cyrix_Or_Blue_Lightning
        jmp     you_have_i80486

Maybe it's best to look for a nice CPU identification library or steal code from
BSD/Linux/x86info/cpuid/whatever?

I suspect this means that the dictionary was not properly initialized due to insufficient privilege for my database user.

Steps to reproduce:
1. I open banshee move one .ogg file on iPod.
   Syncronize -> Save Manual changes
Everythong work's great.
2. While banshee opened I move a second .ogg file on iPod
   Syncronize -> Save Manual changes
I get waiting for transcoder but nothing happens and never finish anything.

Actual results:
Banshee does not update the song on iPod

Expected results:
Transcoder should be called and banshee should put the file in mp3 format on iPod

Does this happen every time?

"GLIB-506461","Conversion of g_assert_not_reached() and friends into functions gives compiler warnings in common use cases","Hi
since glib 2.15.0 g_assert_not_reached() and friends call the function g_assertion_message() which will call the abort().

This causes compiler warnings in several common use cases like
warning: control reaches end of non-void function
and
warning: xyz may be used uninitialized

as now the compiler doesn't know anymore that execution stops at that point and code afterwards doesn't matter.

Take the following example which didn't give a warning with old glib but does with new glib. Another example would be a switch statement with a g_assert_not_reached() in the default case and variable assignements to a previously undefined variable in the other cases. Using that variable afterwards will give a compiler warning too.

#include 

int main()
{
  g_assert_not_reached ()
}


Would be nice to get this fixed somehow in glib...",1,"0"

On OS X libpthread is a symlink to libSystem (comparable to libc on linux) and round() is declared in math.h.

the toolbar. After entering a summary I click Save in the editor dialog
window. The task is created in the Personal tasks folder.

The new Tasks button should be deactivated if no Tasks folder is highlighted.

"EVOLUTION-233708","Auto Completion does not work for LDAP contacts","Hello

Description of Problem:

1. Auto Completion set up for the local Contacts as well
   an LDAP directory (search sub)
2. EMail To:-Line: Type in 3-5 chars of the First or Last Name 
   and wait for the Auto Completion Dropdown-Box
3. Drop Down-Box is only visible when start to type in names
   which are in the local adressbook

It seems that if the start of the name is also in the LDAP directory
nothing will be displayed. Even if its in the local Contacts too.

Sometimes there are also other problems with the access to the LDAP server.

Actual Results:

-

Expected Results:

Should come up with proposed names

How often does this happen? 

Everytime

"NAUTILUS-83702","Dnd of apps on desktop is of no use.","Using build of 29th may on Solaris.

Drag the application say gedit from the menus to the desktop.

It appears as gedit.desktop on the desktop.
On double click that application is suppose to launch. 
But instead of application I get a kind of error window: 

Can't Display Location

Nautilus has no installed viewer capable of displaying

"ORCA-347691","In standard print dialog printer table items not always spoken/displayed","Please describe the problem:
When you get into the standard print dialog (e.g. the one belonging to Evolution and Gedit) focus is automatically placed in the table of printers.  At this point pressing Up or Down Arrow moves you to another printer but that printer name is not spoken or displayed.  If you Arrow one or two more times printer names are then spoken and displayed as expected.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Gedit or Evolution
2. Press Control P for the Print dialog.  The currently selected printer is spoken/displayed correctly.
3. Press Up or Down Arrow ONCE to move to a different printer.  The currently selected printer is not spoken/displayed.
4. Continue to press Up or Down Arrow.  After one or two more presses printers are correctly spoken/displayed as they get selected.


Actual results:
(Outlined in the steps above)

Expected results:
The selected printer would always be spoken/displayed.

Does this happen every time?
Yes on both of my machines.

Other information:
This is with Orca 0.2.6 but I *believe* the problem was present in 0.2.5 as well.",568,"1"

I'll get right on it.
Can I use C++ or do I have to use Ada?



------- Additional Comments From don@eazel.com 2001-01-29 13:57:50 ----

Ada is a little low-level and difficult to maintain.  I was thinking maybe
Javascript.  That way you could write a Javascript debugger at the same time. 
(Something we could never friggin' drag our sorry asses to do at Netscape.)

them out at my leisure  but many are GnomeVFS bugs we should look at for 2.0

authentication.)  The beta forum does require authentication.


Steps to reproduce the problem:

2. Create an NNTP account that points to the server support-
forums.novell.com
3. The account name to use is 'NLD' without the quotes and the password 
is 'Preview' without the quotes.
4. After creating the account choose Tools -> Subscribe to Folders.

I see the folders available on the public support forum that does not 
require authentication.

I would expect to see the private folders available only to authenticated 
users.

Likewise try to minimize the status window only: It does not have a minimize button ^^]

Also it should be hideable maybe into the eggtray )  or just normally^^

perhaps registering only conversions between well known formats

This causes for example the current gaim2 beta to crash when opening the preferences dialog (in this case looking for an oblique variant that apparently doesn't exist).

As far as I can tell simply returning NULL is safe as the caller does check for NULL before adding the font to the list and the caller of the caller finds a fallback on its own.

Subject: The problem and a horrible fix for bug #1087 on AIX
From: James Carlson 
To: 1087@bugs.gnome.org
Message-Id: 
Date: Fri 7 Apr 2000 23:10:11 -0400

AIX shared library support doesn't permit unresolved symbols in a
shared library.  The problem here is that libgtk-1.2.so.0.5.2 depends
on libgdk but it doesn't have -lgdk when it's built.

I'm not sure what the right fix is since it looks like
gtk/Makefile.am and configure.in will need to be altered to support
this quirk.  However here's what I did to get gtk+-1.2.7 to work with
gcc-2.95.2 on AIX 4.1.5:

	./configure --with-locale=C
	make
	make install
	rm -f gdk/libgdk.la gtk/libgtk.la
	# Add -lgdk  before -lgmodule in libgtk_la_LDFLAGS defined
	# in gtk/Makefile
	make
	make install

Ignore the _GLOBAL__DI and _GLOBAL_DD warnings.  The
gtk/test{dndgtkinputrgbselection} programs appear to function
correctly.  For what it's worth here's the output of the testrgb
program:

"EKIGA-442406","ekiga listening socket trouble with ekiga.net account","i'm connected through a dsl modem over a pppoe connection.

i have so a ppp0 interface with an ip address.
in the preferences i selected the ppp0 connection and all works like a charm.

once i started ekiga without ppp0 so listening socket was eth0 another interface with no internet access.

2 troubles:
1) since that moment the listening interface became eth0 and not ppp0 anymore.
next restart with ppp0 up ekiga listens on eth0 again.

after ekiga started ppp0 went up so internet connection available.
2) ekiga registered 4 accounts but not the ekiga.net one saying it's not applicable

selecting ppp0 as listening interface restarting ekiga solved the problem.
i have gizmo voipbuster wengo and skypho accounts and they work.

"EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-305322","EDS Calendar Backend Crash Unchecks All Calendars","Please describe the problem:
If EDS crashes a dialog comes up and says that you won't have access to your
calendars (which is ok).  However all webcal:// calendars are unchecked not
only for that session but for the next time that you log in.  You have to
recheck all of the calendars to enable them again after you close Evo and
restart.  Not very user friendly.  In this case Evo shouldn't pass the
unchecked state to Gconfd at close of program.

Steps to reproduce:
1.

"GSTREAMER-151661","[PATCH] [mad] Possible bug in mad plugin","Hi

I've got a problem when trying to decode a mp3 file (filesrc location=a.mp3 ! 
mad ! ...).  I've founded that the caps was'nt set correctly.  I think this 
problem come from the method use to recover from a MAD_ERROR_LOST_SYNC.

Actually when this happen and the data is a id3tag then mad_stream_skip is 
used to move at the and of the current tag and it is followed by a call 
to mad_stream_sync.

However I've founded that mad_stream_sync does'nt move the actual data 
pointer but only set an internal offset/skip value.   

So mad_stram_sync move the data pointer to the next frame and the next time 
you call mad_decode the offset will be applied.  Of course the position will 
now be wrong and will cause the decoder to return a sync error once again.

I think we should not call mad_stram_sync when mad_stream_skip has just 
been called.  OR mad_stream_skip should consider the skip/offset if there 
is one.",129,"0"

"METACITY-81323","caps lock breaks Alt+tab usage","Perhaps this is intentional but I'm guessing it's not so I'm filing a bug
just in case.  here goes...

While doing a bit of work this evening I noticed that Alt+tab window
flipping wasn't working.  I thought about just doing a killall metacity &&
sleep 1 && metacity but when I went to type a few characters in the
terminal I noticed that my caps lock was on.  (It's not that I'm slow I
have a wireless Logitech keyboard that has *no leds* on it for giving me
the status of numlock caps lock etc )  I turned caps lock back off and
Alt+tab switching worked again.

So is this on purpose or is it a bug?",1,"0"

Description of Problem:

I'm running evo&gtkthml built from anoncvs on 4/3/2003

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.  start evo-1.3 new a mail
2.  pagedown to the bottom of the mail message now you should have a
super-sized cursor blinking on the right of you signature
3.  press enter to move cursor below your signature. The cursor should
return to the normal size.
3. keep pressing  backspace key as if you are trying to delete your signaure

Actual Results:
the mail composer crashes

Expected Results:


How often does this happen? 
always

add any -I's to find the include files (I set CPPFLAGS). This breaks the
build on non-linux platforms with gcc because gcc has its own stdarg.h

"EVOLUTION-212624","appending message - interrupted systemcall/success","Description of Problem:
This just started happening today although I have been using 0.15 (beta 5)
since it's release and I have no problems up until now. Whenever Evolutions
tries to download my new mail over POP3 (either automatically or when I hit
Send/Receive) I get the same error message dialog each time and no new
messages are added to my Inbox. The error message is:

Error while 'Fetching Mail':
Cannot append message to mbox file: /u/pbaker/evolution/local/Inbox//mbox:
Success

It looks like this could be related to bug#211100 or perhaps even a
duplicate except that one says Interrupted system call or Operation now
in progress and of course mine says Success.

This is very major since I can't receive any new mail through Evolution. I
have tried killev and oaf-slay as well as manually killing ANY stray
processes I see and nothing seems to help.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Start Evolution.
2. Click Send/Receive Mail.

Actual Results:
Error dialog appears with the error message:
Error while 'Fetching Mail':
Cannot append message to mbox file: /u/pbaker/evolution/local/Inbox//mbox:
Success

Expected Results:
New messages should appear in my Inbox with no error messages.

How often does this happen? 
Everytime.

None of the new functions seem to have Since: tags.

The Release Engineering API/ABI rules for Platform Libraries imply
that properly documenting functions includes making sure they are
actually in the generated gtk-docs and using Since/Deprecated tags as
appropriate:

"GNOME-PANEL-355513","panel launchers get emptied after left mouse button drag&dropping twice","That bug has been opened on https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+bug/59431

Version: current Edgy on two different computers

A panel launcher loses all of its contents after it has been moved on the panel with the left mouse button twice.

Steps to recreate:
- Add a panel launcher
- Click and holde the left mouse button move to a different location then release the button
- Repeat the last step
- The panel launcher's icon changes to the icon missing icon and looking at the icon's settings reveals that the Name Command and Description fields are empty.

This does not happen when using the middle mouse button to move the launchers.

Actual results:

Expected results:
Continue with warnings or errors but no crash

restores the from.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Double-click on a source other than the current one in the source list to
change playback to that source.


Actual results:
The word from in the album display line disappears.

Expected results:
The word from should remain where it is.

Yes.

Using the bleeding-edge Ubuntu Edgy-Eft after feature freeze.  I had typed sudo make install in an xterm and the password prompt had appeared.  I ignored this and clicked the already open Drivel window on the same desktop.  I made a drag selection going left and upward to select 4 lines of html.  Drivel hung during the mouse drag selection. Not sure if it relates but I'm running Xgl/Compiz and am expecting stability issues.

"XCHAT-GNOME-332686","Selecting text in the backlog copies it to clipboard","When selecting text in the backlog area selected text is copied into clipboard (Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V not middle-click) automatically. 

A picture is worth a thousand words so I attach a screencast showing the issue.
NB: stock xchat has the same issue but I don't know whether this is configurable or not

To reproduce it:
1. Select some text in the backlog area
2. Focus the bottom entry and hit Ctrl+V

The expected behaviour would be to paste the content which was previously in the clipboard but what happens is that the selected content is pasted (this does also happen when pasting in third party apps)",11,"0"
"BONOBO-314664","implicit pointer conversion might cause serious breakage on 64-bits arches","Version details: Debian's 2.10.0-1
Distribution/Version: Debian/sid

Hi

Dann Frazier reported in Debian bug  that
libbonoboui 2.10.0 builds with a dangerous warning on the ppc64 arch.  This
warning might indicate a conversion which might cause serious breakage on 64-bit
arches.

He proposed a small patch against bonobo/Makefile.in and
bonobo/bonobo-selector-widget.c and I checked that
bonobo/bonobo-selector-widget.c wasn't fixed in 2.10.1.

Please review and include this patch.  I don't know why but the Makefile.in
part seems irrelevant now.

Only making the default application font 10pt or smaller solves the

"GNOME-VFS-46390","Stopping Nautilus while navigating to an unreachable http server can block nautilus indefinitely","1) Find a host that is not reachable.  That means DNS resolution is possible
but pinging the hostname never returns a response.  ipchains magic may make it
possible to construct this  case
2) Type in that host in the Nautilus URI bar
3) Hit Cancel

Expected:
	Navigation stops
Actual:
	Nautilus UI Freezes (probably for TCP timeout)

What's going on:

The Gnome-VFS HTTP method is blocking indefinitely on a connect().  It holds a
semaphore on the the GnomeVFS cancellation context.

The main thread of Nautilus calls gnome_vfs_async_cancel().  It blocks
indefinitely waiting for the semaphore.

Proposed fixes:

1) GnomeVFS connect() and read() abstractions could be set to non-blocking mode
and spin checking for cancellating event.  This does not handle the case where
gethostbyname() blocks

2) gnome_vfs_async_cancel could disconnect callback stuff but schedule the job
cleanup for later.  This seems more complicated but more complete.



------- Additional Comments From pavel@eazel.com 2001-02-06 18:09:02 ----

3) use signal to unblock the call. As Mike points out signal behaves quirky in
that it behaves non-portably on different implementations. If the set of
differences was manageable this would be a good solution though because you
would end up interrupting a call that othewise locks up resources faster.



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-02-06 18:14:50 ----

Very similar to 6290



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-02-06 18:16:04 ----

pavel--

Oh yeah I don't think a signal will bail out gethostbyname but then I don't
know if the job lock is called in the case where gethostbyname is called

It's reasonable to guess that this might be a duplicate of bug 44573 but I don't

------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-02-20 13:38:58 ----

To pavel to add to his doom.

Due to the bad behaviour of gethostbyname (see bug 44573) it would be best if
this were fixed so that gnome_vfs_async_cancel doesn't block even though the
thread may hang around for a while.

Removing dependency on 4573




------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-02-20 13:40:11 ----

(to respond to darin and don's comments:  4573 is one of the things that can
*cause* this bug but it is not the only thing.  And fixing 4573 is not the only
or best way to fix this bug)



------- Additional Comments From don@eazel.com 2001-02-20 20:33:53 ----

Making gnome_vfs_async_cancel not block seems like a large task to be tackling
now.  Can this really be done in a day?

She failed to notice the big thumbnail button was meant to be pressed in order to change the background and thought it was the only available background.

I guess the design should be tweaked a little in order to make it more obvious what to do in order to select another background.

On a related subject I think in the selection dialog a click on one of the thumbnails should automatically select the corresponding background and close the selection dialog.",262,"0"

---- Reported by shotwell-maint@gnome.bugs 2010-08-19 16:33:00 -0700 ----

Original Redmine bug id: 2449
Original URL: http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/2449
Searchable id: yorba-bug-2449
Original author: Vera Yin
Original description:

1) Rotate a small photo that fits wholly within the full-window display with
room to spare.

2) Press Shift to view original.

The display will be off as the aspect ratio tries to match that of the
previous orientation (landscape or portrait). If the Shotwell window is shrunk
so that the photo does not fit wholly within Shift to view original will
display properly.

It looks like the assumption being made in sort_node (if we have no message it
must be a dummy node which also means it must have a child just use that as
the sort data (close enough?)) is wrong because it's somehow getting a dummy
node that has no child.

"GDM-324337","can't disable automatic or timed log-in features.","This bug has been opened here: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=21139

Just installed a fresh copy of Dapper Flight-2 and I notice a werid problem
with GDM.

I enabled the timed log-in option and also the automatic log-in.
It works fine.
Problem: I then disabled both options but it has no effect. That is it will
still log me automatically when I start the machine and if I log-out it will
log me back in automatically after 30 seconds.

I thought maybe it could be a problem in gdm-setup which perhaps failed to
update the gdm configuration file properly but no.
Here are the relevant (I think?!) lines of /etc/gdm/gdm.conf

[daemon]
# Automatic login if true the first local screen will automatically logged
# in as user as set with AutomaticLogin key.
AutomaticLoginEnable=false
AutomaticLogin=vincent

# Timed login useful for kiosks.  Log in a certain user after a certain
# amount of time
TimedLoginEnable=false
TimedLogin=vincent
TimedLoginDelay=30

According to that file I have indeed disabled both automatic and timed log-in.
But gdm somehow acts as if they were still enabled !

Description:

when there's no weekday in the Date: header for example:

[...]

pango/opentype/Makefile.am didn't change but the generated Makefile (and Makefile.in) got invalid in this build.  Don't know the cause.

Makefile.in (thus Makefile) contains near the top: 

SOURCES =

Note the lack of backslashes.  (files attached)

I tried different things and discovered modifying Makefile.am to use SRC instead of SOURCES (line 8 & 37) fixed the problem.

This is because of this code:

GByteArray *
_rsvg_acquire_xlink_href_resource (const char *href const char *base_uri GError ** err)
{
    GByteArray *arr = NULL

    if (!(href && *href))
        return NULL

    if (!strncmp (href data: 5))
        arr = rsvg_acquire_base64_resource (href err)

    if (!arr)
        arr = rsvg_acquire_file_resource (href base_uri err)

#ifdef HAVE_GNOME_VFS
    if (!arr)
        arr = rsvg_acquire_vfs_resource (href base_uri err)
#endif

    return arr
}

As you can see it retries other methods on failure but uses the same GError for each but this error was already filled in by the failing function! E.g. rsvg_acquire_file_resource fails and fills |err| then the rsvg_acquire_vfs_resource will fail too and try to overwrite the error.

Hi

While upgrading from GNOME 3.16 to 3.18 on Gentoo Linux ia64 gtkmm 3.18.0 failed to compile with gcc 4.7:

/var/tmp/portage/dev-cpp/gtkmm-3.18.0-r1/work/gtkmm-3.18.0/gtk/gtkmm/widget.cc:426:17: error: declaration of 'virtual Gtk::Widget::~Widget()' has a different exception specifier

This is a regression from gtkmm 3.16.x.

A similar issue was reported on gtkmm 3.18.0 (bug #759262).

"GNOME-PANEL-111313","Menu Bar's context menu appears upon right-click on dead space","The menu bar's context menu is called when the user right-clicks within
the menus on some dead space.

The easiest way to reproduce is to open the Actions menu and then
right-click one of the dividers. Can also be reproduced irregularly while
right-clicking as one moves the mouse up and down a top-level menu full of
items.

Does not seem to happen within submenus as there most menu items have
their own context menus.

Also appears not to happen with the 'Main Menu' applet.",101,"0"

Other information:
I compiled this rhythmbox version for myself. My gtk version is 2.8.14 on Fedora 
Core 4. I compiled it myself using the FC5 test packages as a base so my 
installatin is not exactly standard. The version is actually 0.9.3.1 not 0.9.3 
but I had the same problem on 0.9.3 anyway. My gstreamer version is the latest 
of the 0.8.x series.

here is the other output from bug buddy which you might find useful.

"EPIPHANY-518338","epiphany-webkit: cannot open links in new tabs","Please describe the problem:
here's another bug with the latest version of epiphany-webkit.

it is currently not possible to open a link in a new tab (or a new
window for that matter). the Open Link in New Window option in the
right-click menu does not work.  also there is no Open Link in New Tab
option in the that menu.  and finally middle-click on a link
does not open the link in a new tab.

thanks for the hard work.

this is debian bug #467237 (http://bugs.debian.org/467237).

"GNOME-BLOG-497363","Cannot focus in text fields to enter text","Please describe the problem:
After the applet is loaded configured etc and I click on the 'BlogV' button I cannot enter text into the Title field or main text area unless I paste it. That is when I click on the text field a cursor does not show up text does not appear when I type text is not deleted with backspace / delete. 

The only way to enter text is to use Copy / Paste.

I'm fairly certain that clicking on the applet button does not focus keyboard input on the 'Post' drop down window as it should. Therefore whatever window had the keyboard focus last keeps the focus and the 'Post' window does not gain the keyboard focus.

I am using gnome-2.20 && gnome-blog-0.9 from Gentoo.

Steps to reproduce:
1. 
2. 
3. 


Actual results:
The last window that had focus keeps the focus so that window receives the keyboard input.

Expected results:
The gnome-blog 'Post' drop-down window should receive the keyboard input.

Does this happen every time?
yes

It may be possible to solve this problem by using package.mask to
prevent one of those packages from being selected. However it is also
possible that conflicting dependencies exist such that they are
impossible to satisfy simultaneously. If such a conflict exists in the
dependencies of two different packages then those packages can not be
installed simultaneously.

"NAUTILUS-46386","Saving gnome session can drop the --no-default-window parameter","To reproduce:

1 - Choose gnome foot/settings/session/startup programs
2 - Choose add and use /gnome/bin/nautilus --no-default-window as the
command.
3 - Press ok in the control center.
4 - Log out of gnome and log in again.  Nautilus starts with the desktop drawn
and no default fm window.
5 - Choose gnome foot/settings/session/save current session
6 - Log out of gnome and log in again.  Nautilus starts with the desktop drawn
and a default fm window.

By saving the session the gnome session manager dropped the --no-default-window
commandline option.

I assume this could be fixed if the open a file maanger window when starting
nautilus option was handled in the preferences dialog and offered as a
checkbox option in the first time druid.

This is based on a customer feedback email a portion of which appears below:

joebvppc@online.fr
2/4/1 8:20

Secondly i can't force nautilus to start with no default window when
started by the gnome-session. It seems that the gnome-session manager
don't remember that nautilus was first started with the
--no-default-window option.

I've changed the session restart command for nautilus to unconditionally be
`nautilus --no-default-window'

Verification of this fix is not a 1.0 showstopper. Punting verification to get
off the radar.

"EVOLUTION-234406","Evolution 1.2 (from red-carpet) fails to display IMAP Inbox","Package: Evolution
Priority: Critical
Version: 1.2
Synopsis: Evolution 1.2 (from red-carpet) fails to display IMAP Inbox
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
Recently (2 days ago) upgraded RH8.0 system via red-carpet and chose to
u/g Ximian Evolution component (1.0.5 I believe) to Ximian 1.2 . 
(Evolution was closed during the upgrade!).
When u/g complete and Evolution was restarted the conversion dialog
appeared once complete all was ok for this session.  Restarting
Evolution some hours later the top-level mailbox was displayed (in the
Folders pane) as containing new messages BUT the RHS email pane simply
displayed the message This folder cannot contain messages.
Settings are unchanged from the previous version and on x-check with a
local user (running Debian and Evolution 1.0.5 on same mail server) are
ok.
The email server is Cyrus IMAP 2.0.12 (nb it is 2.0.x and not 2.1 !!)
running on Linux kernel 2.2.12.  No unusual error messages on email
server logs.
Have attempted to remove ~/evolution - no luck.  Removed ~/evolution and
~/.gnome/evolution* and ~/.gnome/apps/evolution* to get initial setup
dialog again --- this leads to same sympton (first session is ok altho'
not all available folders are subscribed to) but on quitting and
re-starting evolution the top-level INBOX folder (again with new
messages indicated via bold numbers) is not displayed!

Argggh !!!   :-)   Otherwise I love Evolution ... keep up the excellent
work!

"ORBIT2-95791","imodules ommit typecodes for nested structs","While investigating bug 95591 I ran into another imodule bug: nested

If I have the following input:

        long a

  }

and generate an imodule the imodule will only list TC_testing_ParentStruct

for structs nested in unions (and would probably see the same for unions
nested in structs and unions nested in unions).

"NAUTILUS-47421","Font option menu in Appearances too long for screen with > 38 fonts","I just installed Eazel snapshot Sun Mar 4 21:32:38 2001 (nautilus 0.8.3) on my
Mandrake Linux 7.1 box and wow what a difference from the snapshot I was
running before (from mid-February). Speed is tolerable now. There is a problem
with the font option menu in the Appearances preference dialog though. I have
a 1024x768 display my default desktop font is 12 point Helvetica and I have
about 50 fonts installed on my machine. The option menu that the fonts are
listed in can only fit about 38 fonts before the rest go off the bottom of the
screen.

The solution is probably to use a different widget like a list box or a combo
box that can display as many fonts as a user has in a scrolled widget.

------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-03-06 07:54:53 ----

Another alternative is to have GTK fix option menus such that they work 
reasonably even if there are more items than fit on the screen (as for 
instance they do on the Mac).



------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-03-06 18:26:15 ----

Theres a fixed scrolling menu in Gtk+ 2.0 but thats probably too much work
(maybe even impossible?) to back port.

I think we used option menus because combo boxes in gtk didnt really get across
the point that the choices were read only.

How does the Mac work in this regard ?

In Netscape i had the same problem and the workaround i came up with was having
a More... item at the end if the option menu did not fit on the screen.  Not
so elegant even though it worked.




------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-03-06 18:36:11 ----

I think we should probably do nothing about this bug until we port to GTK 
2.0. It's possible to access any menu item if only by choosing one closer 
to it so the next time you pop up the menu more of the menu items in that 
direction will appear. You can repeat this multiple times if necessary (I 
think that works -- right?)

The Mac solves this problem by using a scrolling mechanism that looks a 
little weird (temporarily shows white space in the popup menu) but has 
the following properties: (1) The selected item appears under the mouse 
button when pressed (2) you can drag to the end where there's a little 
arrow -- pausing over the little arrow will scroll to show more items in that 
direction.





------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-03-20 20:47:07 ----

I fixed this by adding a More... submenu as soon as no more items fit one the
screen.

I agree this is probably not the best solution especially when there are enough
entries to cause more than one More... menu to appear.

However it is better than what we currently have.

When Gtk+ 2.0 comes to town we will have scrolling menus and we wont need this
anymore.

---Type  to continue or q  to quit---q

Anyway the bug is here in main.c:

static void 
handle_read (gpointer data 
	     int source 
	     GdkInputCondition condition)
{
	static int pos = 0
	static int to_get = NSAMP*2
	static int count

	count = read(source aubuf[curbuf] + pos to_get)
	if (count <0) {
		exit(1)		/* no data */
	} else {
		pos += count
		to_get -= count
	}

aubuf is a short ** so pointer arithmetic in aubuf[curbuf] is in sizeof(short).

However count to_get pos all are measured in sizeof(char) so this reads into
aubuf[curbuf] beginning twice as far in as it should and overflows the end.
This overwrites the widget pointers (declarations at beginning of file are:

static short aubuf[BUFS][NSAMP]
static GtkWidget *dial[2]
static GtkWidget *window

) and soon causes segv normally in led_bar_light_percent().

Obvious fix is to cast aubuf[curbuf] to (char *) before adding pos.",82,"0"
"GPARTED-358285","Gparted 0.3.1 crashed during a partition move and trashed the partition table.","Steps to reproduce:
I'm not sure it can be. See below for a description of what happened.

Stack trace:
gparted was running from its live-cd. It was operating on a 20 GB hard disk arranged as follows (approximate sizes in physical order): 

  #1 extended 20 GB 
  #5 logical 0.4 GB swap 
  #6 logical 0.6 GB ext3 
  #7 logical 1.5 GB reiserfs 
  #8 logical 3.5 GB reiserfs and
  #9 logical 14 GB no type. 

A three step action was being performed: 

  (1) reduce #7 to 1.0 GB shrinking it from the right 
  (2) shift #8 0.5 GB left and reduce its size to 1.0 GB and 
  (3) expand #9 to the left making it approximately 17 GB. 

Step 1 completed okay. The program aborted after having worked on step 2 for several minutes. After the crash the partition table using Gparted as well as several other programs showed nothing - an empty drive. 

I used 'testdisk' also on the CD to try and guess the proper location for the partitions. Partitions #5 and #6 were properly identified as to type and appeared to be in the right location. There was no sign of #7 even though its shrink operation had completed. #8 appeared at several places with a constant size of about 1.0 GB. It appears that it had been shrunk and was being moved to the left in ratchet steps when the crash occured. It still had about 100 MB to move to the left.

Even though #5 #6 and #8 were properly identified as to type and appeared to be at acceptable locations when their settings were written to the partition table they appeared in gparted with no type information. I eventually erased the entire disk and started over.

(There is no stack trace since I don't know what that is and have no idea how to obtain one. I've done my best to decribe the circumstances above.)


Other information:
I had used the new Gparted several times prior to this always without incident. As a consequence of my prior good experiences the volume of the data and the fact that it was not of a critical nature I did not make a copy of the data as it existed just before the incident. However I did have ways of recreating most of it. I have been able to do that in a little more than a day.",628,"1"

Files encoded using faac version 1.24 or 1.24+ fail to be recognized as
audio/x-m4a.  Instead the files are shown to be video/quicktime.  The file
plays fine using totem-gstreamer but does not load into rhythmbox.

Steps to reproduce:
1. encode the wav file using the faac encoder with the options -w -o file.m4a
file.wav -q 130 --mpeg-vers 4 --no-midside --artist artist --album album --title
title --track track --genre genre --year 1999
2. run gst-typefind file.m4a

Yes

"TOTEM-340014","The last un-maximized window size isn't saved","Please describe the problem:
If you open Totem maximize it and close it the next time you open it you
won't be able to un-maximize it. The window will just be - say - 1024x768 but be
moveable.

The correct way to handle it is to save the size of the last non-maximized
window and restore it on un-maximize.

Evolution used to have the same problem and they fixed it very recently so it
might be easier for you to understand what I mean by reading Evolution's bug
#243962.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Totem
2. Maximize its window
3. Close Totem
4. Open Totem again
5. Click on the un-maximize icon in Metacity


Actual results:
The window moves a little bit but stays at the same size it was before.

Expected results:
The window size should be restored to the latest non-maximized size.

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

Hi Patrick
I have just tested the last livecd version and i can say :
It stops the boot process about 60 seconds!! after :
input : ImPS/2 Generic Wheel
it could be have something to do with usb...
I never meet this problem with older versions.

I have chosen nv driver for my G-Force 4 video and it works fine :)
I wonder that hot plug works : i though you have disable this fonction (i must
be wrong with that)

BTW : i am unable to reduce the window when clicking at the right bottom between
the _ and the X. I just can move the GParted window but cant reduce it.

Steps to reproduce:
1. if i plug some usb drive before it boots the process stops after sd attached
sg0 type 0 and it stops the same time (about 60 sec)
2. 
3. 


Actual results:


Expected results:


Does this happen every time?
yes it seems to

i maybe could make two otr three differents bugs ???",5,"0"

"NAUTILUS-47661","Mouse-over coordinates wrong for +/- zoom controls in some themes","When I use a theme that doesn't use the magnifying glass zoom control I can
make the + and - controls highlight while the mouse is still within the zoom
percentage label.  Probably the best way to see this (since I can't seem to make
my mouse pointer show up in screen shots with either gimp or xv) is to ask me to
show you or to follow these steps:

1 - Choose one of the Crux themes
2 - Center the mouse on the zoom percentage label.
3 - Slowly move the mouse left or right until the - or + control
highlights.  

You should find that the mouse is still within the borders of the zoom label.

This is for the 1.2 or deferred milestone.

"ANJUTA-506740","ianjuta_editor_get_text crash if request text past the buffer length","ianjuta_editor_get_text allows to read length characters starting at position from the text editor.

In the documentation it's written that if the length exceed the editor buffer length it gets characters up to the end of the buffer. It's doesn't work like this at least with scintilla. 

ianjuta_editor_get_text computes the end position by adding length and sends the command SCI_GETTEXTRANGE to scintilla. In scintialla/Editor.cxx there are the following code to handle this command:
  int cpMax = tr->chrg.cpMax
  if (cpMax == -1)
    cpMax = pdoc->Length()
  PLATFORM_ASSERT(cpMax Length())

cpMax is never -1 but it could be greater than the length of the buffer (pdoc->Length()) and in this case we get an assertion failure.

I think the documented behavior is easier to use and this could be fixed easily by changing scintilla replacing the assertion with a condition. But I don't know if we could get this change in scintilla. So perhaps this should be handled in the editor plugin. I don't know what is the behavior of GtkSourceView in this case.",0,"0"

If the number of headers to fetch is greater than the actual number of headers in the group no headers are fetched.

Steps to reproduce:
1. choose a newsgroup with a small number of posts
2. select Get Headers put a larger # for the number to retrieve (i.e. 2000)
3. No headers are retrieved.


Actual results:
No headers are retrieved

Expected results:
Headers retrieved fully

Does this happen every time?
Yes

Other information:

Other information:
I'm using encfs in my home partition so probably the problem is not inside
straw code but in FUSE or encfs. However encfs upstream doesn't understand what
straw is doing at the moment of crash so he doesn't know why his special
filesystem is not working properliy. The thread is at [0]. Could you speak with
encsfs developer and try to debug this?

Thanks.

"GNOME-PANEL-148672","Autohide broken on non-expanded panels","This bug has been reported in the Debian BTS: http://bugs.debian.org/255608

Hi

I have a panel which manages to slide around as it autohides so that it's
hidden about 20px from the edge of the screen...

Full instructions on reproducing it...

=====

create a bottom panel

turn off expand

turn on autohide

grab it by its right hand move handle

move it to the bottom-left of the screen until it snaps into the corner

then move the pointer to the right until it is outside the panel but the
panel has not snapped out of the corner

release the mouse pointer point inside the panel and then point away so the
panel hides

witness the panel slide to the right as it hides itself downwards.

=====

It seems as though the panel isn't snapping the coordinates it uses to hide
with. But I'm not sure (not being a gnome developer)",48,"0"
"GTK+-144771","no visual feedback when editing a new row inserted at the end","Steps to reproduce:
0) From the bme add so many topics that they won't fit in whatever height the
new-bookmarks dialogue's topic selector has. Make sure ALL topics start with
letters less than 'T'.
1) In a EphyWindow go to a non-bookmarked URL
2) Bookmarks->Add bookmark
3) In the new-bookmark dialogue click New topic

Expected results:
The text in the new topic's entry is highlighted and whatever I type there is
shown.

Actual results:
The new entry says Type a topic but is not hightlighted and the entire row
is selected with grey background. I cannot see what I type but when I press
return the topic is created with the typed name.

The same thing can also reproduced in the bookmarks editor when creating a new
topic. The key in both cases seems to be that the list has to scroll to the end
and that the new editable row is the last row of the list.",178,"0"

I can however send Palm databases to the laptop if I use the command-line obexserver (from the Debian package of the same name) and manually register the OPUSH service with a patched sdptool.  The patch in question adds 0xff to the list of supported formats: http://www.oook.cz/bsd/sdptool.c.diff

I've tried patching libbtctl in the same way (it appears that the add_opush function from sdptool.c is widely copied and pasted -- I found another copy of it in sobexsrv).  hcidump showed that the patch took effect (I saw 0xff in the supported formats list sent to the Palm) but the transfer failed to work.

I have captured hcidump output (verbose text not raw bytes) of a successful session with obexserver and an unsuccessful session with gnome-obex-server (using a patched libbtctl).  Perhaps these will help diagnose the problem.",9,"0"

So when I tell Nautilus what to do using the obvious dialog that I can
access from the GNOME menu Nautilus ignores me. To tell Nautilus what to
do in a way that will actually get Nautilus to obey me I have to
right-click and choose a non-intuitive item from a pop-up menu.  The Open

"GDM-343539","Three users switching leads to blank tty9","That bug has been opened on https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/40011

Using dapper's gdm and the switch user funcionality available in the log out dialog do:

1. Login as user A.
2. From A's desktop switch user and login as B.
3. From B's desktop switch user and login as C.
4. From C's desktop switch back to B (resume session).
5. As B log out (this returns you to A).
6. From A's desktop switch user to C (resume session).
7. As C log out.

After step 7 you find yourself at a blank tty9 with a blinking cursor.

Explanation: users A B and C are on tty7 tty9 and tty10 by default. When B logs out tty9 becomes blank. When C logs out later from tty10 the screen is retuned to tty9. The logic in gdm needs to be changed. When C logs out the user should be returned to tty7 in this situation (or to a new gdm screen).

Please note this is a bug in the logic of gdm not a display/video driver issue. It is 100% reproducible on my machine at least.",1465,"1"

Severity: normal
Version: GNOME2.2.0 2.2.0

Synopsis: Load Average monitor missing
Bugzilla-Product: gnome-applets
Bugzilla-Component: multiload
Description:
Description of Problem:

There are only 4 load monitors (cpu/mem/net/swap) but the load average
is missing. In Gnome 1.x
it was there. So I want to ask when we will have a load average monitor
again.
BTW is it possible to swap the position of the net and swap load? The
swap is related to memory
and so it should be positioned nearby the mem load monitor. The same
applies to the load average
(if we have it again) and the cpu-load.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Start the multiload applet.

Actual Results:


Expected Results:


How often does this happen?

Description of Problem:
expanding a server tree in the move message dialog expands that server tree
in the folder list

I have two configured email servers with many folders and use vfolders to
read my mail.  I keep the server folder trees collapsed to make more room.
 However I often want to move messages to real folders.  I press
Ctrl-Shift-v to move the selected messages and see a dialog with my
folders.  The server trees are collapsed. (which is another bug)  When I
expand a server tree the main tree list in the shell expands as well.  

It should not do this -- these trees should be interacted with separately.
 (This only happens the first time and is probably related to loading the
list of folders off the server.)",1953,"1"

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. get a mp3 with more than one dot in the filename
2. gst-launch-ext file.name.mp3
3. you get No suitable pipe found for extension  atomic kitten - the
tide is high.mp3.

Actual Results:
One try of mine:
mark@flappie:~/music$ gst-launch-ext 26.\ atomic\ kitten\ -\ the\ tide\
is\ high.mp3 
No configuration file /home/mark/.gst found.  You might want to create
one.
No suitable pipe found for extension  atomic kitten - the tide is
high.mp3.
mark@flappie:~/music$ 

And a good result with the renamed file:
mark@flappie:~/music$ gst-launch-ext atomic.mp3                         
            
No configuration file /home/mark/.gst found.  You might want to create
one.

This also stops the emission of

In other words the above change would make private headers identical to ignored headers -- I suppose that was the original intention.  I cannot imagine how the inspection of private classes could reveal anything that should appear in the public documentation.",6,"0"

"EVOLUTION-239799","Evolution hangs after applying Summary settings","Please fill in this template when reporting a bug unless you know what you
are doing.
Description of Problem:
Specifically this hang occurs after applying changes to the local folders
displayed on the Summary page. After selecting the local folders I want and
clicking Apply Evolution becomes mostly unresponsive. I can still close
the settings window using the Close button but the main Evolution window
will not refresh. I've included the strace output at the bottom of this report.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Open the Evolution Settings window from the Tools menu.
2. Click on Summary Preferences
3. Click on the tab labelled Mail
4. Expand the Local tree and click on the checkbox buttons beside any
folders of your choosing.
5. Click the Apply button.


Actual Results:
CPU usage increases to 80-99%. The button widgets still visible in the
Settings window will still respond to clicks and the Settings window will
disappear when the Close button is clicked but the main window will not
refresh when it is brought into focus again.

Expected Results:
Settings will be applied and the program will run normally afterward.

How often does this happen? 
Everytime I apply the changes to the local folders displayed on the Summary
page.

strace output contains the following repeated endlessly until the process

"NAUTILUS-CD-BURNER-355982","burning multiple copies of a CD is excruciating (unreliably recognized CD-Rs)","Please describe the problem:
At the end of writing the first CD I get asked: eject/make another copy/quit.  First it's not clear exactly whether I should hit eject before clicking make another copy so the interface is a bit imprecise.  But the behavior was even worse so I still don't know whether I should eject before or not.

The main problem (clearly a bug maybe in HAL) was that after inserting another CD nautilus-cd-burner would burp at me saying please insert a new CD with
sufficient space blablabla even though the CD I had just installed was indeed blank.  The CD was detected because the dialog box did include an eject button.  I then tried to click OK or first eject then OK and other variations but none worked except for: click eject then re-close the CD slot manually then wait a little for the disk to spin then finally click OK.  It's not clear if the wait was necessary but the rest seemed to be indispensable.

Usabilitywise the fact that the disk is not automatically ejected when the dialog about insert a new blank CD pops up is rather odd: how am I to insert a new CD other than by first ejecting the current one?

Steps to reproduce:
1. set things up for wrinting select write CD
2. when the write is done press eject
3. then insert a new blank CD-R disk
4. then press make another copy

You can also try to not click eject and instead to immediatly click make another copy and quickly replace the previous CD with the new one as cd-burner opens&closes the drive slot.  Same thing.

Then you should get the incorrect complaint about the CD not being blank.  Click OK and notice that after a short while it comes right back still complaining that the CD is not blank.


Actual results:


Expected results:


Does this happen every time?
Yes although I have felt like there was a part of non-determinism in the way the thing failed.  Probably simply because there are sufficiently many different ways to do things (whether you open the drive-slot via eject or manually by pressing the button on the drive itself same thing for closing it and in which order you do them) and I kept trying a different one to see if some magical order worked better (I was burning a large number of CDs and it was already getting late).

now if you look at the mixer applet it still displays maximum volume.
it should display minimum volume.

alsamixer window that the mixer-applet sets the volume back to 'his' value

also if you move the volume up/down in the mixer applet you can see the bars

"GNUMERIC-465509","Writing your own Python functions manual page contains a syntax error","On this page:

http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/doc/sect-extending-python-writing.shtml

the listing for my-func.py contains:

    from Gnumeric import GnumericError GnumericErrorVALUE

it should be

    from Gnumeric import GnumericError GnumericErrorVALUE

(added comma). The error prevents the example from working.

The only way to get a useful error message and spot errors in Python functions like this is to run gnumeric from the command line. I suggest adding a tip to that effect to the page also. Anybody who writes Python functions is gonna need to do it.

This email thread refers to the same error in the manual and the same solution: http://www.mail-archive.com/gnumeric-list@gnome.org/msg00527.html",15,"0"

Synopsis: special care for buttons of minimization and close
Bugzilla-Product: metacity
Bugzilla-Component: general

Description:
you may know refresh of screen gives load to system.
if you may not but I really know that for my poor system :)
in this state of load:

What about to give special care for minization and close button?
now metacity indicate click on window and bring to front.
and finally do some stuff popup menu close etc.

but minimization and close is not worth to load the window in front of
screen.
it'd better to just the specific task without focusing.

What do you think of this?

"GSTREAMER-334226","typefindfunctions plugin crashes on PPC on registration","System: linuxPPC running YDL-4.1 [FC4 clone gcc-3.4.4]

The typefind plugin fails to load when running any of the gst-* tools. For example

% gst-inspect-0.10

ERROR: Caught a segmentation fault while loading plugin file:
/usr/local/src/GARNOME/2.13/garnome-2.13.x/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libgsttypefindfunctions.so

Please either:
- remove it and restart.
- run with --gst-disable-segtrap and debug.

Replacing only libgsttypefindfunction.so with its predecessor from version 0.10.3 eliminates the problem.

For what it's worth this problem appears to be linuxPPC specific. The version 0.10.4 plugin loads without incident on a lintel box.

The problem is that the New Playlist menu entry is not being diplayed in the first section of the Music menu but at the bottom as the last entry right under Quit.

I get a console message that could be releated:

"YELP-473040","yelp does not display correctly translated man pages","Please describe the problem:
I use Fedora 7 with the man-pages-ru package installed which provides some of the manuals in Russian. However when I try to display such a manual it's displayed in the wrong character set.

And another problem with this is that when multiple-language manual pages are available there's no way to select a specific version. This is sometimes needed as the translated manuals can be missing descriptions for newer switches and features.

The later problem can be reproduced with the mplayer manual which has its manual translated into several languages. If you enter mplayer into the search box you should get two or four results (depending if you have installed mencoder or not) but clicking on the english manual gives you the translated version anyway which is in the wrong encoding.


Steps to reproduce:
1. Install man-pages-ru from base repository and possibly mplayer from livna repository.
2. Select Russian in GDM login screen and login
3. Run Yelp
4. In the search box enter: man ls


Actual results:
You get the help page filled with garbage as shown on the screenshot

Expected results:
I should see the russian text like 'man' displays on the screenshot.


Does this happen every time?
yes

"GNOME-APPLETS-159903","Locations Love - Austria (2): Provinces not only cities","I file this seperate from the other Locations Love bug because I am
not sure if this is a bug or a feature  )

Up to now I only saw cities (or other defined places like airports)
in gwether. Now there are some *Provinces* (strangely enough not all
9 of them just two). This concerns the locations

Oberösterreich and
Niederösterreich

Both of them are larger areas (Bundesländer) and have a widely 
varying weather on their different parts see eg. for weather in
Oberösterreich (Upper Austria):

http://wetter.orf.at/ooe/

I'll attach a patch against my other patch though likely it's 
easier to simply nuke these locations by hand.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you've got further questions!

Description:
Description of the crash:
Whenever I go to rip a CD that contains international characters in the
name of the artist (Queensryche for example) or a track sound-juicer
crashes before it gets to start the process.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. Insert a disk with international characters in the name of the artist
or track
2. Wait for the CDDB data to be downloaded and displayed
3. Click Extract and watch SJ crash

Expected Results:
SJ should handle the international characters properly.

Taking bugs previously assigned to Pavel assigning them to myself. Will parse
them out at my leisure  but many are GnomeVFS bugs we should look at for 2.0

Move to unassigned. I'll probably want to take a crack at some of these myself

If the python method module raises a gnomevfs exception (ie.
gnomvfs.NotFoundError) it is handled by libpythonmethod which propogates it
correctly to the gnome-vfs subsystem.
libpythonmethod should reset python's error indicator it doesn't.
This could cause the next python function to 'raise' an error even though it
completed successfully.

"METACITY-346927","Heuristics for fullscreening legacy apps","Archives appear to be busted right now but there's an interesting thread right now in metacity-devel-list about legacy apps (in particular apps running under current versions of WINE) and fullscreen windows.  The word legacy may not quite be fair here as it appears to be caused by strangeness in the Windows API making it so that WINE apps will likely use funny manual methods to attempt to duplicate fullscreen functionality.  It should be noted that this will likely also apply to some legacy apps not running WINE.  It appears as though there are two areas in which our heuristics need to be improved:

src/window.c:recalc_window_features() disables ability for apps to enter the fullscreen mode if the window is not resizable unless the minimum size hints are exactly the same size as the screen and the window is undecorated.  While a decorated window with minimum size hints equal to the size of the screen inherently conflicts with fullscreen size (as can be viewed one of two ways -- either because decorations conflicts with fullscreen mode or such a window would be too large to be fullscreen) it appears that this is a method used by applications to attempt to manually fullscreen themselves instead of using the appropriate hints.  It is likely that the majority (and maybe even all) apps with decorations and such a minimum size hint intend to be fullscreen so we should probably remove the decoration checking.

src/stack.c:window_is_fullscreen_size() is used to try to treat certain windows as fullscreen despite not using the appropriate hints if we can detect that they have somehow manually tried to duplicate fullscreen functionality.  These heuristics check both the size and position of the window and require that the client window of the app be placed at the upper left corner of the workspace.  For windows with decorations that will not be possible as constraints will always force the decorations into the workarea.  As noted above we should probably treat apps as intending to be fullscreened even with decorations so these checks should probably be based on size only.  (Or if they are based on position then the outer window should be checked).

Summary:
  * Remove decoration check in src/window.c:recalc_window_features()
  * Check window size only (not position) in
    src/stack.c:window_is_fullscreen_size()",45,"0"
"GPERFMETER-97212","[Solaris] Meter's not placed properly after invoking with -H option","I'm running Sun's Stable build 12 version of Gnome. Gnome perfmeter 
sources are checked out using the timestamp Tue Oct 15 15:00:00 BST 2002.

I invoked the perfmeter by providing the '-H' command line option (display 
horizontal meters). It displayed the 'CPU' meter. I then opened the other 
meters one by one (i.e. Load Disk Page Context Job Swaps etc). After 
the fourth meter the gnome perfmeter window does not get resized 
automatically to show the newly added meter. 

I also tried to invoke gnome perfmeter with all meters on and in 
horizontal form as: 

'gnome-perfmeter --all -H'

Even in this case some of the names of the meters were overlapping with 
one another. (will be attaching a screenshot)",268,"0"
"GLADE-400357","Default name for unsaved projects not very descriptive","We use the default name Untitled Project for new unsaved projects. I think Project is a very generic term that does not describe '.glade' files well. I think a better name would be Design. This name better describes exactly what a '.glade' file is. In any case Project is better suited to IDEs or Time Management applications.

Furthermore the GNOME HIG recommends using Unsaved instead of Untitled to identify unsaved documents. So the name for unsaved documents might be better as Unsaved Design.

"GVFS-521889","when copying a file to webdav://  cancelling the copy doesn't actually cancel it","Please describe the problem:
When copying a file to a webdav:// share a progress dialog appears with a cancel button. Clicking the cancel button closes the dialog and makes everything look like the copy action was indeed cancelled but actually the file is still being transferred. Refreshing the view shows that the file still grows (until the whole file is transferred).

Steps to reproduce:
1. go to a remote webdav:// share preferably over a slow connection
2. copy a large file (large enough so it will take many seconds to transfer) from your local disk to the share
3. when the progress dialog comes up click on the Cancel button to the right of the progress bar
4. notice that the progress dialog closes

Actual results:
When refreshing the folder list (with F5) the half-copied file can be seen when periodically refreshing the view it can be seen that the file size grows. Also the network connection is still being used.

Expected results:
The file should stay at (roughly) the size it had when cancelling the transfer. The transfer should stop nearly immediately so the connection is no longer used and no further disk space is consumed on the remote system.

Does this happen every time?
Yes.

Other information:
This was seen in Ubuntu Hardy Alpha with gvfs 0.2.0.1-0ubuntu1 .

A minor (maybe related) irk is that the progress bar itself is at 100% right from the start instead of actually showing progress.",2,"0"

Description:
This latest comes from selecting panel in the Control Center but I get a segfault whenever I try to run the theme selector the mouse config or just about any other GNOME configuration tool.  I tried blowing away ~/.gnome and starting from scratch but that made matters worse or so it seems.

"METACITY-123838","Right left bottom onscreen onstraints wrong","the resize constraints code for right left and bottom is broken if you
think about it.  The code calls get_outermost_onscreen_position which
returns values for the outermost points that can be occupied by the upper
left corner of the window and have the window still be visible onscreen.

However these functions which control the ability to resize the right
left and bottom edges use this value as the outermost position for _those_
edges which is simply wrong.  In reality there is no way that resizing
these edges could cause the onscreen constraint to be violated as such
these functions should all be no-ops.

A patch will be attached that fixes a large number of constraints bugs
reported here.",3,"0"
"GIMP-313922","Crash doubleclicking in move tool with floating selection","Distribution/Version: ubuntu

Load an xcf that has lots of layers (though I'm not sure if that's important).
Copy something perhaps one of the layers. Paste it and leave it as a floating
layer.

Select the move tool.
Doubleclick on the floating layer. (Which happens to me when I try to move the
layer and my finger slips on the mouse button causing an accidental second click.)

GIMP either crashes or hangs (including hanging X). I see a hang when I run
gimp from the cmdline and doubleclick I see a crash when I run from the
windowmanager menus and click-drag-slip-secondclick.

If I get to a console and attach gdb to it I get:

Description:
I have a new Evolution installation in Debian sid. Additionally I use
the newest GNOME packages from the experimental branch (GNOME 2.10).
Evolution's calendar contains only one Personal at the beginning.
Then
I added another one and put an appointment into this one. Worked fine.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Add a second additional calendar (that you have 3 in total)
2. put an appointment to any of the new calendars

Actual Results:
* The appointment is displayed twice once in the first additional
calendar and a second time in the second additional calendar
* Delete one of the appointments -> both vanish
* Double click the appointment and assign it to the other additional
calendar -> doesn't work
* delete one of the additional calendars -> dialog asks if you really
want to -> click yes -> doesn't delete the ccalendar
* Add a third additional calendar (now 4 in total) -> (old and new)
appointments appear 3 times
* look at ./evolution/calendar: there are no .ics files for additional
calendarsDescription of Problem:

You can move it _before_ every position. The last possible position is the

Try example from bug #97403 to reproduce.

Description:
Description of Problem:
I had created a group for playlist purposes so I started dragging songs

button in the process of doing this.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Drag songs to a custom created group.

Actual Results:
Crash.

by adding and then removing a button.  The toolbar had the same buttons
as the default setup when the application crashed.)

"GNOME-SESSION-420283","configure.in quoting bug introduced by #383428","Please describe the problem:
The fix of #383428 introduces a quoting bug. The value of $libexecdir is now partially expanded within configure.in itself so it is no longer possible to redefine libexecdir while running make.

The generated Makefile now contains (unless --libexecdir or --with-at-spi-registryd-directory were given):

AT_SPI_REGISTRYD_DIR = ${exec_prefix}/libexec

But it should contain:

AT_SPI_REGISTRYD_DIR = ${libexecdir}

so that the variable expansion happens only within the Makefile.

Steps to reproduce:
Run configure with no arguments and then make libexecdir=/some/nonstandard/libexecdir

Actual results:
The build ignores the custom libexecdir setting and adds -DAT_SPI_REGISTRYD_DIR as if libexecdir were not specified

Expected results:
The build adds -DAT_SPI_REGISTRYD_DIR=\/some/nonstandard/libexecdir\

Yes

"EVOLUTION-336367","Evolution calendar items do not display time of items correctly","Please describe the problem:
After receiving meeting invites from MS Exchange 2003 users the time of those
items once selected and added to my Calendar (personal or the one I have in
Exchange) are listed in my calendar 3 hours earlier.

My timezone is correct (America/Montreal) and my system time is correct.  The
user who sent me the meeting invite has the EST timezone set and her time is
correct also.

Steps to reproduce:
1. receive a meeting request from a MS-Exchange user
2. accept the meeting
3. meeting reported in Evo calendar 3 hours earlier


Actual results:
lists the meeting earlier than supposed to.

Expected results:
should show the meeting at the time as specified in the meeting invite.

Does this happen every time?
yes

"GLIB-72387","GObject / GObjectNotifyQueue / GTrashStack not thread safe","I'm trying to use GObject in a threaded library but I ran into some trouble.

I don't think this is the same as the other threading issues that has been
reported (65041 64764)

It looks like GObject creates a GObjectNotifyQueue which uses a GTrashStack
to allocate and reuse memory. 

But GTrashStack is not very thread safe so replacing it with a simple
g_new0 and g_free combo seems to fix my problems. But memchunks should
probably be used instead.

Also by using GTrashStack the memory allocated will never be returned to
the operating system.

My testcase can be downloaded from here:
http://afs.codefactory.se/~jonas/multithreading.c

"GTK+-93020","GtkHandleBox::snap_edge may have wrong default value","As far as I understand the default value of GtkHandleBox::snap_edge is -1
(the value is unset). However if GTK+ is built with Sun Forte C compiler
on Solaris  (I use Forte Developer 7 C 5.4 but it doesn't matter) the
dafault value my be set to 7.

Test case.
----------
#include 
#include 

int
main (int argc char** argv)
{
    GtkWidget* widget
    gint snap_edge
    
    gtk_init (

    widget =  gtk_handle_box_new ()
    
    gtk_object_get (GTK_OBJECT (widget) snap-edge 
    printf (snap_edge = %d\n snap_edge)
}

Output.
-------
$> ./test
snap_edge = 7


I assume that the problem is that the field snap_edge of the struct
_GtkHandleBox is a bitfield of type gint (=int) - see gtkhandlebox.h.

However if the actual type specifier used is int or a typedef-name
defined as int then it is implementation-defined whether the bit-field is
signed or unsigned. (see The C Language Specification Standard ISO/IEC
9899:1999). It means that both -1 and 7 are passible values in this case
and this is not a bug in Forte C compiler.

I propose to apply the diff below:

"NETWORKMANAGER-343679","switch to turn wireless off/on","So - my laptop has an (unfortunately pretty concealed) switch to turn wireless things on  this yields interesting stuff in syslog:

May 25 15:17:59 linux kernel: ipw3945: Detected Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection
May 25 15:18:00 linux kernel: eth0: no IPv6 routers present
May 25 15:18:00 linux kernel: ipw3945: Radio Frequency Kill Switch is On: networking to work.
May 25 15:18:00 linux kernel: Kill switch must be turned off for wireless networking to work.

Unfortunately the helpful message 'Turn Kill switch on' - doesn't get to the desktop user who is left non-plussed as to why their wireless isn't working / showing up at all when you click the nm-applet thing.

HAL shows this when the device is disabled:

When it is enabled I get this syslog goodness:

and the device shows up perfectly  at this point the hal output looks rather different:

But of course -some of that may be bluetooth (?) The PCI device appears to show no difference in it's HAL output to get the status you need to:

/sys/bus/pci/drivers/ip*/*/rf_kill

various bit-fields are available for hardware & software disablement.

I think it is essential that the version 1.4 supports utf-8 not only for new

"METACITY-504692","Windows open on one display then jump to another on first click","Please describe the problem:
I'm currently running Metacity 2.21.2 from Hardy and I'm experiencing an odd issue with a multi-monitor configuration. My two monitors are side-by-side and windows tend to open first on the left monitor then once it's occupied they'll start on the right monitor.

The weirdness is that the window that opens on the right monitor (often firefox for me but seems to affect others as well) jumps to the other monitor on the first mouse click event. The click itself is delivered to the window - I know this because the first thing I usually do when I open Firefox is toggle the quickproxy status on the status bar. The status changes thus I know the click event wan delivered and handled despite the window moving.

Steps to reproduce:
This seems very reproducible for me. I open two applications which maximize on startup the first will be on the left monitor and the second one on the right. One click on the app on the right moves it to the left monitor still maximized.

"EVOLUTION-217678","Message parser not detecting attached file on multipart/alternative message","Description of Problem:
I received a multipart/alternative message (you know: the ugly text/HTML)
with an attached jpeg file.  Evolution does not display the attachment at
all. The message parser seems to have not clue that the jpeg file is attached.

The message format appears to be a multipart/related or which the first
part is the multipart/alternative text and the second part is the attached
jpeg.

The encoded attachment text shows up if you select 'View -> Message Display
-> Show email source' but is never visible otherwise. I've only had the
problem on the multipart alternative messages. I was able to save the
attachment with mutt then forward it back to myself (reattaching the file)
and evolution would be able to see the file.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
I've enclosed a link to an example message (from my Mom :) under
'Additional Information'.

How often does this happen? 
I've received two emails of this format (both mailed from Outlook 8.5) both
suffering from the problem.

"GNOME-MAG-137105","Must be able to specify source & target displays once running","Perhaps this might be considered a dup of 136089 or 135409 (which strongly
appear to be dups of eachother).  I leave that to the maintainer...  In any
case:

Presently the only want to specify the source and target display for the
magnifier is on the command line at startup.  As the expected way for
gnome-mag clients to invoke gnome-mag is via activation we need to have a
way to tell gnome-mag what the source & target displays should be once
started.  Perhaps this might be done by introducing a new command-line
argument to gnome-mag which says don't start magnifiying yet (e.g. remain
largely un-initialized) and then new CORBA API to get it to start
magnifying with a specific source & target.  Should also have API (if not
already present) for querying what the source & target displays are.",25,"0"

The gnome-nettool icon shown in the GNOME menu is very blur. The reason behind this because the icon located inside /hicolor/24x24/ is not 24x24 eventually it's 256x256. It must be a mistake by the developer. Fix this issue is very easy just generate the 24x24 from 22x22 icon by adding 1x1 pixel around. The detail on how to do so is on Tango Icon Theme website.

This way any web business uses Lynx over my rather slow connection.

The webcontrol applet starts up netscape by default instead of using

This is a little inconsistent when you are expecting something else.

I've noticed that Google Calendar also uses a version of Quick Add when you click on a day to add an event.  Since the date is already specified by the mouse click the parser is only looking for start/end times and other sundry event details.  (In fact even if you type in a date it's ignored and the event is created for the one you clicked on.)

Not only is this a nice way to quickly enter an event it means our current create/update dialog only needs to be presented only when an event needs to be updated.  Since this dialog is getting kind of bulky due to all the various event fields and will only get bulkier as more features are added using quick add for specific-date event entry means the user isn't presented with it more than they need to see it.",35,"0"

------- Additional Comments From darin@bentspoon.com 2001-03-05 13:21:26 ----

The multiple styles bug is already reported -- it's bug 47348 -- so lets use this
for the defaults to bold part only.



------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-03-05 13:31:56 ----

The style that is chosen by default for any given family is the first style
listed in the menu. So this bug report morphs into Some fonts list styles in
non-standard order.

The code that constructs the list of styles that is later turned into the menu
makes no attempt to order the styles it just appends the new style to the end
of the current list of styles for this font.

So there are two ways I can imagine to fix this bug:

(1) Make the code that creates or iterates the global font table ensure some
standard ordering of styles.

(2) Make the code that creates the style list for each font ensure some standard
ordering of styles.

I think (2) is probably the right level at which to address this. One issue is
that the styles are really just strings not members of an ENUM that are
guaranteed to match some pre-existing notion. So we'd have to do string compares
and put any unmatching ones at the end of the list.

An ordering that makes sense to me is:

Normal
Book
Bold
Italic
Oblique


Don: Is this worth addressing for 1.0? (I think it's fine not to personally.)

Ramiro: Does my analysis/suggestion make sense? I'd be happy to implement this
if so but I'm assigning it to you so that you can review the suggestion.



------- Additional Comments From don@eazel.com 2001-03-05 15:18:49 ----

I don't think this is a 1.0 blocker.




------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-03-12 03:10:11 ----

Sullivan yes you described the problem perfectly.  We just need to sort the
font style list using the criteria that normal is always first.

Exactly how everything after normal is sorted is a little tricky but not
impossible to get right since the number of styles is finite (or at least well
known)




------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-03-20 20:42:39 ----

Now i want to continue editing my latex file.  So i press ctrl+tab to change the focus and... it doesn't work.  I guess that it doesn't work because it emulate a console environment but i think that it's an usability issue to capture the focus mechanism.

So i suggest that the shortcut ctrl+tab allow us to change focus on another part of gedit...

More of this feature that I want John to consider.



------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2000-08-10 09:51:13 ----

Sounds like an interesting though probably tricky feature that we should
consider but not until after the first version. Marking deferred.

I wouldn't mind having this assigned to me since John Dislikes it and thinks it
would take him a week (and I think I could do it in a day or two).




------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2000-08-24 07:21:11 ----

The main reason I dislike it is that I don't think the design is worked out and
I'm having trouble imagining a design that works both for type-to-select and
also for typing commands. But I'm happy to assign it to Maciej!

>Synopsis: Gnumeric crashed when restarting a suspended VM (vmware v. 2.0.2 build 621)
>Class: sw-bug
System: 700 MHz PIII (ASUS P3B-F m/board) 256 MB RAM. OS: Debian 2.2.17 (potato rel.)

>Description:
Bug 1
Gnumeric crashed instantaneously on restarting a 
suspended VM (3 occasions VM unaffected same 
vmware process + Win95 subprocesses still running/
suspended).

The spreadsheet was uncomplicated (trivial 
calculations on a few electrical power readings. 
No cells used outside range A1-N34).

Bug 2
Gnumeric has sometimes crashed when inserting 
today's date from Insert/Special/Date menu using
the mouse (but not with Ctrl-).

Sorry I know it's not much to work from.

>How-To-Repeat:
Bug 1
Not invariably repeatable but just restarting a
suspended VM can be sufficient (refuses to crash 
just now).

Bug 2
Also intermittent - Insert/Special/Date selected
with mouse can cause an instant crash (but not 
just now date correctly inserted using mouse or 
Ctrl- - but no date ever inserted using 
Alt-I p d).

I clicked on a folder on my desktop and *boom*. What was interesting is
that I'm pretty sure I only clicked once but that I got two windows one

"EVINCE-353802","handle esp ghostscript interpreter crash better","Binary package hint: evince

Forwarded from: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/58141

Ubuntu 6.06.1 Evince 0.5.2

I tried to open postscript (.ps) file in Ubuntu 6.06. Evince 0.5.2 was started but it displayed only Loading. For long time. No error.

I found that postscript compiler (like gs-gpl) was not instaled on my system. After installing postscript interpreter Evince worked fine.

I report this as a bug as there was no error message from Evince that it miss postscript support that is needed to open the file.

Observed on this package:
http://www.terryburton.co.uk/barcodewriter/files/postscriptbarcode.tgz

This is a gz archive that has several ps files inside it could be open with archiver (Fle Roller 2.14.4) and after that you can start Evince by selecting some ps file from this archive.

On the other side I can open this file with the same Evince without any problem:
http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/postscript/4.ps


1) echo This is just a evince bug demonstartion >test.pdf
2) evince test.ps
3) you will see only loading... forever no error message that test.ps is not correct postscript file.

You can see some error message in command line but user that has no knowladge about command line and he only use mouse to open files will never see such message. And it is clear that evince ignores message from postscript interpreter.

"RHYTHMBOX-333734","Rhythmbox crashes when Skype is running","Distribution: Debian 3.1
Package: rhythmbox
Severity: normal
Version: GNOME2.12.2 unspecified
Gnome-Distributor: Debian
Synopsis: Rhythmbox crashes when Skype is running
Bugzilla-Product: rhythmbox
Bugzilla-Component: General
Bugzilla-Version: unspecified
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.12.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:
I have Skype (1.2.0.18) installed as a deb from debian-unofficial.org.
When I try to run Rhythmbox (0.9.3.1-1) it plays Music (and it doesn't
matter what radio local files or files from a samba mashine) for about
10 min. After that it starts crashing all the time until I close Skype.
After that Rhythmbox runs normal again.
I don't have this effect when I listen to music with xmms or totem.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. open skype
2. run Rhythmbox and listen to anything
3. wait until it crashes

Expected Results:
That it runs without a crash? Don't know what I should put here...

How often does this happen?
Everytime after ca. 10 min

Additional Information:
I use a Debian unstable system. And my gnome 2.12 is more or less up to
date. The gstreamer has the version 0.10. I use alsa. And in this report
I listend to a radio stream. I hope these Informations will help you
even if my report is a bit woolly phrased.

This behavior is very confusing. Deleted unread messages show up in the
mail folders as unread. But I'm on several mailinglists and usually I
just skim trought the headlines and then hit delete all. But the deleted
messages are still counted as unread and I can't see when new mail does
arrive. It's not good that a folder says ten unread mails and when I
search through it no unread mail shows up.

"GSTREAMER-329184","[lame] remove tag writing support","Tag writing support should be removed from the Lame plugin.

(It doesn't work anyway currently as the last buffer isn't flushed on EOS so the tag is never pushed out in the current 0.10 version)

Reasons:

  a) it has never worked in the 0.10 series

  b) Lame only supports a very very small number of tags

  c) Lame only writes tags with ISO-8859-1 encoding even
     when told to write ID3v2 tags so a lot of users will
     never be able to write tags containing strings in
     their language with lame

  d) Lame writing tags causes problems when used with
     muxers like avidemux or matroskamux (although one
     could give lame a property to disable tag writing
     but people would still need to find it and disable
     that).

I say let's remove it before it's too late and recommend id3mux as replacement (and check that id3mux actually works).",96,"0"

"DASHER-338837","Confusing handling of --with-darwin in configure","This bug is a whole bunch of related things resolution to one affects how to resolve another or if it becomes moot...

1. Why must the user know to pass --with-darwin instead of just using existing autoconf host information to determine it automatically?

2. That flag controls whether or not to pass a certain flag which is implemented as (pseudocode):

if (--with-darwin) then
  GTK2BUILD_LIBS=lots of things
else
  GTK2BUILD_LIBS=lots of things -Wl--export-dynamic
fi

where lots of things is the same in both cases. It'd be clearer what's going on here if the common flags were assigned in a common block and then only the differences within if/then/else.

3. OTOH why is this situation being handled by a platform test instead of a feature test? If the goal is use a certain flag if that flag is available then more portable to use AC_LINK_IFELSE to test if that flag is available.

4. It appears that --with-darwin should control the WITH_DARWIN token in config.h but there's a syntax error in that AM_CONDITIONAL

5. OTOH the only consumer of that token that I see is in Src/DasherCore/AutoSpeedControl.cpp where it controls whether to define a round() function. I assume the goal is to avoid declaring a local round() if there's one in the system libraries? Again better to use a test for the actual feature instead of using a platform heuristic.",126,"0"

Description:
Description of Problem:
The track editor crashed long after I had exited the application because
it was hanging. The problem started after having problems getting it to
get updated info for a CD I put in. It may be related to my machine
having the CD-ROM in a docking base (or really just a small socket an
inch high) and that the machine has to be released / inserted if I
forget to power up before placing the laptop in the dock.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.

ximian.6.1 (RH9):

If I click though several of my folders the view often changes (I seem to 
have custom views for all the folders I've checked though I don't recall 
customizing them all).

To reproduce:
Try this at least if you've customized any folder views.  I expect the 
column layout will change several times as you change folders.  Now pay 
attention to one particular folder that definitely HAS a custom view say 
your INBOX.  Look at the view and remember what columns you see.  Now 
switch around to other folders and go back to INBOX (or whatever).  Is the 
view the same?  Try it again.

I'm getting crazy results here but I can't see any clear pattern.  It 
seems like sometimes Evolution is intentionally activating the view for a 
particular folder (perhaps the correct one) and sometimes it is NOT 
selecting any view--in other words the newly-selected folder uses the view 
of the previous folder rather than refreshing the view settings for the 
new folder.",7,"0"

------- Additional Comments From aelman@eazel.com 2001-02-28 19:52:06 ----

NOTE: this is definitely a 1.0 bug as it prevents anonymous use of the new
softcat (although perhaps that's desirable after all?)

Actually it might be in nautilus-mozilla-view.

I'm on it.



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-03-01 11:10:55 ----

The really mystifying thing here is that the install view seems to be getting
the right URI even if the right URI isn't on the location bar.



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-03-01 11:33:03 ----

Robey I'm going to KILL you for using the anonymous@ URI.  That explicitly
breaks shit in the gnome vfs uri canonicalization function.  Oh well I'll make
it work.



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-03-01 11:35:13 ----

Not only that but the canonicalization function wants to escape the '=' which
is actually correct behaviour I think since the = isn't part of a query string. 



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-03-01 11:36:16 ----

ACtually to be honest what's wrong here is that gnome-vfs is actually trying
to parse an authority field for a URI that it should have nothing to do with.



------- Additional Comments From don@eazel.com 2001-03-01 12:07:24 ----

Approved for 1.0.  Mike does this look like it's fixable?

Could someone give me the eazel-trilobite-configure.pl command that should be
used to test against the new softcat?



------- Additional Comments From mikef@praxis.etla.net 2001-03-01 15:23:57 ----

Oh I just stuffed the URL in an HTML file on my local apache




------- Additional Comments From robey-bugs@lag.net 2001-03-01 16:03:25 ----

(it's okay for vfs to quote the = -- it's done that for a long time so we
expect it)

also i want to point out that http://user[:pass]@host[:port]/ is allowed in urls
so :P
:)




------- Additional Comments From brett@eazel.com 2001-03-02 16:43:19 ----

As near as I can tell this bug is fixed.  I can't reproduce a case where
eazel-install: is the resulting url from following a link of another url.  I
created an HTML files that had the link mentioned in this bug report and
Nautilus handled it correctly. Perhaps this should be tested by someone more
familiar with the services environment?  I can't currently access stage-services
for testing there.  

Sherry could you please investigate this?  Thanks!

"GOK-159332","GOK can't work with Mozilla correctly.","Bugster Bug #6199099

This is a regression bug in cinnabar23.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start GOK and Mozilla.
2. In GOK activate Mozilla.
3. In GOK click Menus/Toolbar/UI Grab

Bug Observation:
When clicked on GOK Menus button GOK has two buttons: Back and Stop. 
When clicked on GOK Toolbars or UI Grab GOK contains all the menu items and
their sub menus. 
I attached a snapshot showing what the bug looks like.

Evaluation

This was introduced by the fix for bug #157420.  A four-line fix is available.
bill.haneman@sun.com 2004-11-23 14:04:23 GMT

This is a P1 regression therefore I think it merits STP.
bill.haneman@sun.com 2004-11-23 14:05:08 GMT

Comments

GOK works with Evolution correctly in Cinnabar23/sparc. I will try to use the
old GOK builds to see what it is.
jessie.li@sun.com 2004-11-23 03:16:27 GMT

This is another case of regression caused by GOK's change. Mozilla (both b22 and
b23)works find with GOK 0.11.14 (build22) but has problem with GOK 0.11.16
(build23).

RE conversation w/R O'Dea approval not required for putback to this unsupported
component provided I make the committment to ensure it's integrated and tested
in a nightly build prior to b24.  I am doing that now and will pull the fix if
there's a problem.

Synopsis: resizing the genreplaylist collum makes it expand and contrast on both sides of the collum

Bugzilla-Component: Interface
Bugzilla-Version: unspecified
Description:
Description of Problem:
When you try and resize the lengh of the Genre and Artist collum in
the rhythmbox playlist. both sides of the collums will expand and
contrast when dragging with the mouse. When you click and drag the
collum to make it smaller the left border thats shared with the
previous collum will exteend out dramatically. But as you drag towards
the left it'll resize back to its orgional size but will not go any
smaller.. But when you try to make the collum wider this extends both
collum borders even further apart when only the collum border that you
slected should resize.

The Track and Title collum behavor seems to be fine though.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. mouse over the Genre or Aritst collum till your cursor changes to
the resize arrow thing
2. Click and drag Dragging left or right
3. 

Actual Results:
not ideal playlist collum widths 

Expected Results:
Good behavor just like any other collum resizing in programs

How often does this happen? 
Every time you try it.

Description:
Everytime I restart my machine (or X) and reload evolution RC1 it
forgets my password for my IMAP account. I have to put it in again
everytime. Remember password is on and I have tried switching it on and
off but it still doesn't remember the password.

What is strange though is that if I just close down evolution and then
restart it in the same X session it remembers the password. But as soon
as I reboot the machine or open another X session it forgets it.

definitely a link issue: works on a build i made myself (on RH7) but not on the
rpm's coming off of build2.

ldd of the broken 'trilobite-eazel-install-service' shows an extra libdb.so.3 at
the end: BAD MEDICINE.  we've seen this before.

gotta figure out how that extra libdb.so.3 got there and how to make it go
away.

[eli has been helping (at gunpoint) so i changed the QA contact to him]




------- Additional Comments From robey-bugs@lag.net 2001-01-16 22:09:39 ----

it's a build issue svadilfari (build2) is using glibc 2.2 probably because
rick's magick disk installs that [? just a guess].

glibc 2.2 seems to add its own -ldb link to the trilobite-eazel-install-service
which fouls up the rpm library.  (rpm is very very picky about which version of
libdb it links with we've run into this before.  i'm going to file another bug
about a possible long-term solution to that shortly.)

on my test machine i tried a normal RH7 install with a correctly built nautilus
(built against glibc 2.1.9x) and installs worked.  then i installed glibc 2.2 on
the test machine and tried another install: still worked.  this gives me
confidence that if we build against 2.1.9x we'll work on both types of systems.

so: i'm punting this bug to robin:  please install glibc 2.1.9x (whatever comes
with RH7.0) on svadilfari and then punt this bug back to me.  hopefully that
will cause trilobite-eazel-install-service to get built correctly.

------- Additional Comments From rslomkow@eazel.com 2001-01-16 23:19:13 ----

The issue is that RedHat updates
ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com:/pub/linux/redhat/updates/7.0/i386

do indeed use glibc-2.2

there were problems with the default on a non-updated RedHat 7.0 machine.

I think the real solution is to update the user to the official RedHat updates.





------- Additional Comments From robey-bugs@lag.net 2001-01-17 01:33:15 ----

robin our users will be okay but -- at least for now -- we can't have the 

build2 machine using glibc 2.2 because it messes up the link order for the 

install lib.



quick testing on my machine showed that users should be okay with either glibc 

as long as the rpm's were built on a glibc 2.1.9x machine.

Eskil has two bugs marked as assigned - Bug 44891 and Bug 44892.  These two bugs
may be related to Bug 45706.



------- Additional Comments From robey-bugs@lag.net 2001-01-17 17:18:20 ----

bad news -- the build from 14.something today was still built with the evil
libdb stuff in it.  are we sure that svadilfari had been updated before 2pm?  if
so we're back to regressing it to glibc 2.1.9x.

Robey Robin or anybody --- I have absolutely no idea how to verify this.

I can upgrade to RPM 4 on an RH 6.2 system but I'm not sure how to confirm that
this fixed without encountering other bugs.



------- Additional Comments From eskil@eskil.dk 2001-01-27 18:54:41 ----

Eli - for Friggs sake don't try to upgrade to rpm4 on a rh62 machine.

This patch has been tested by Ramiro and whonot. You can only verify by using a
set of nautilus pr3 builds on a rh70 machine.



------- Additional Comments From robey-bugs@lag.net 2001-01-27 19:03:27 ----

agreed should be easy to verify or not on RH7 machine: if installs work at all
under RH7 this must be fixed. :)

then obviously you can't verify this till it does )




------- Additional Comments From eli@eazel.com 2001-01-27 19:41:42 ----

Removing PR3 designation. This cannot be verified in PR3 due to other bugs
blocking install lib from being testable on RPM 4.

eskil's been able to get it to work -- cc'ing him.

Original URL: http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/6334
Searchable id: yorba-bug-6334
Original author: Jim Nelson
Original description:

Now that multiple accounts has landed we should display a From: line in the
composer window to indicate which account the message is being sent from.

For new messages the From: line should be a combo box allowing the user to
select which account to send from. The default should be whichever account was
selected when the New Message button was pressed.

For replies and forwards the From: line should be a static label. We may in
the future allow the user to change accounts when replying or forwarding a
message.

If only one account is registered for Geary no From: line should be shown.

We decided for this ticket that if an account is deleted while a reply or
forward is open they will get an error message. That way they have a chance
to save the message before it's gone for good.

Looks good! Only a couple of small things:

  * I think AccountInformation should return a MailboxAddress that is constructed from its real_name and email address. MailboxAddress.get_full_address() can then be used instead of pretty_string(). This will be useful elsewhere and means MailboxAddress holds all the logic for constructing email strings.
  * Looking at the various Accounts panes I notice some similarities and differences between them. One thing I see is that they're using different spacings (some 6 others 4). Is this intentional? Would it make sense to create an AccountPage class that accepts a .glade filename as a ctor argument that does all the work of loading the file and setting up the Gtk.Box. Subclasses would then only need to hook up signals and initial widgets. If this doesn't make sense let me know.

Somehow I accidentally committed the changes before they were complete.
Fortunately it doesn't actually **break** anything but we've decided to
replace pretty_string() with a method that returns a MailboxAddress as
suggested above.

Synopsis: Add sender to contact list forgets to close window.
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
Looking at the Inbox I select a new unread message with the right mouse
button and select 'add sender to contact list'. Evolution pops up a
window name 'Sender' (enormous in size for some reason) with the
sender's information and a button 'Add to Contacts'. I click the 'Add to
Contacts' button and the Contact Quick-Add window pops up (reasonable
size) with two editable fields for the full-name and e-mail of the
contact and three buttons: 'OK' 'Edit Full' and 'Cancel'. I hit the
'OK' button. But the enormous 'Sender' window has not been closed. If I
again click on the 'Add to Contacts' button in the 'Sender' window the
'Contact Quck-Add' window reappears.

I would consider this a bug. The 'Sender' window should disappear when
the first 'Contact Quick Add' window reappears.

copy a documentation block (such as from an inherited member of a base 
class) using \copydoc does not work when the reference to the member 
function is written in the JavaDoc style (i.e. Class#member()). 
 
For example say you have a base class as follows in some file 
BaseClass.java: 
 
/** 
 * Base class. 
 */ 
public class BaseClass { 
    /** 
     * Some public method.

/** 
 * Derived class.

public class DerivedClass extends BaseClass { 
    /** 
     * Some public method.

     * @copydoc BaseClass#publicMethod()

gst-launch filesrc blocksize=100000 location=eye.png ! pngdec ! ffmpegcolorspace
! video/x-raw-rgbbpp=(int)24depth=(int)24 ! pngenc ! filesink location=eye2.png

The result will have inverted R and B channels. For some reason inserting an
alphacolor into the pipeline before ffmpegcolorspace makes the problem go away.

Another interesting thing to note is that when launched like this pngdec's
srcpad will fixate to bpp=24depth=24 which is bogus as the image is
bpp=32depth=32. That's another bug though. (Why the image does not get
horribly distorted by this is beyond me)

As for the fix... Most probably the red_mask and blue_mask properties of
pngdec's source pad should be exchanged when neccessary. Question is how do I
change those and how do I detect I need to? (fortunately PNG is always in
network byte order)

Another option is to use png_set_bgr(pngdec->png) on little-endian systems so
libpng does not perform the MSB->LSB conversion itself and the default values
for red_mask and green_mask are ok. I'll look into libpng if there is a way to
tell it that it should not modify the byte order at all.. That would be best.",24,"0"

Package: nautilus
Severity: normal
Version: GNOME2.8.1 unspecified
Gnome-Distributor: Gentoo Linux
Synopsis: List selection is not preserved in view menu
Bugzilla-Product: nautilus
Bugzilla-Component: View as List
Bugzilla-Version: unspecified
Description:
Description of Problem:
When a folder is set to list view in the view menu it does display the
files as a list. However when you leave the folder and return to it the
view menu is still defaults to icon mode. The files are displayed
correctly but to return them to icon view you must reselect list view
and then select icon view.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Set a folder to list view
2. Leave and reenter the folder

Actual Results:
View menu defaults to icon view whether on not that is the case

Expected Results:
View menu should accurately reflect the settings of the current folder.

How often does this happen?
Always

"EVOLUTION-317755","IMAP flags are not regularly synch'd with server","Please describe the problem:
Currently IMAP flags (read answered deleted) are not synch'd as part of the
normal email synch procedure that occurs by default every 10 minutes. Instead I
believe they are synch'd only in specific circumstances (e.g. on expunge or when
a folder view is changed).

This works poorly for people like me. I leave evolution
open 24/7 on my home machine. When I get up I read new emails and
delete a bunch of them. When I go to work I ssh in and start pine to
see if new email has arrived. But none of the flags indicating which
emails I have read answered and deleted at home are set.

Please sync flags whenever email is synch'd.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open evolution.
2. Mark an email as deleted. Don't expunge.
3. Go to a different computer and oper another email client.
4. Look at email flags.


Actual results:
Deleted emails are not marked as such in the second client.

Expected results:
Deleted emails are marked as such in the second client.


Does this happen every time?
Yes.

"GNUMERIC-118907","some string errors","Package: Gnumeric
Severity: trivial
Version: GNOME2.2.2 1.1.20-cvs
os_details: Ximian Inc.
Synopsis: some string errors
Bugzilla-Product: Gnumeric
Bugzilla-Component: Analytics
Description:
I've found some string errors in the decription of the functions. (still
present in todays cvs)
(and one grammatical error)

I'll summarize them below:

------------------------------
the arguments and the corresponding description of the arguments don't
match in
AMORDEGRC:

@FUNCTION=AMORDEGRC\n
@SYNTAX=AMORDEGRC(costpurchase_datefirst_periodsalvageperiodrate[
basis])\n
@DESCRIPTION=AMORDEGRC returns the depreciation for each accounting
period.\n
\n
@settlement is the settlement date of the security. @maturity is the 
maturity date of the security. @basis is the type of day counting
system you 
want to use:\n

-------------------------------
Idem for AMORLINC
@FUNCTION=AMORLINC\n
@SYNTAX=AMORLINC(costpurchase_datefirst_periodsalvageperiodrate[
basis])\n
@DESCRIPTION=AMORLINC returns the depreciation for each accounting
period.\n
\n
@settlement is the settlement date of the security. @maturity is the 
maturity date of the security. @basis is the type of day counting
system you 
want to use:\n
-------------------------------
Idem for DURATION

@FUNCTION=DURATION\n
@SYNTAX=DURATION(settlementmaturitycoupyieldfreq[basis])\n
@DESCRIPTION=DURATION calculates the duration of a security.\n
\n
@settlement is the settlement date of the security. @maturity is the 
maturity date of the security. @issue is the issue date of the
security. 
@rate is the interest rate set to the security. @pr is the price per
$100 
face value of the security. @basis is the type of day counting system
you 
want to use:\n
-------------------------------
Function SYD Example contains wrong argument:

@EXAMPLES=\n
For example say a company purchases a new computer for $5000 which has
a 
salvage value of $200 and a useful life of three years. We would use
the 
following to calculate the second year's depreciation using the SYD
method:\n
=SYD(5000 200 5 2) which returns 1280.00.\n

should be five instead of three:
salvage value of $200 and a useful life of five years. We would use
the 
______________________________________^^^_______________________
-------------------------------
YIELDMAT contains descriptoin of argument @frequency which is not an
argument in this function?

@FUNCTION=YIELDMAT\n
@SYNTAX=YIELDMAT(settlementmaturityissueratepr[basis])\n
@DESCRIPTION=YIELDMAT calculates the annual yield of a security for
which 
the interest is payed at maturity date.\n
\n
@settlement is the settlement date of the security. @maturity is the 
maturity date of the security. @issue is the issue date of the
security. 
@rate is the interest rate set to the security. @pr is the price per
$100 
face value of the security. @basis is the type of day counting system
you 
want to use:\n
\n
  0  US 30/360\n
  1  actual days/actual days\n
  2  actual days/360\n
  3  actual days/365\n
  4  European 30/360\n
\n
* If @frequency is other than 1 2 or 4 YIELDMAT returns #NUM!
error.\n
* If @basis is omitted US 30/360 is applied.\n
* If @basis is not in between 0 and 4 #NUM! error is returned.\n

-------------------------------
RANDUNIFORM
the layout of the description is confusing: * If a <= x < b and 0
otherwise.

@DESCRIPTION=RANDUNIFORM returns a random variate from the uniform
(flat) 
distribution from a to b. The distribution is\n
\n
\tp(x) dx = {1 over (b-a)} dx.\n
\n
* If a <= x < b and 0 otherwise.\n
* If @a > @b RANDUNIFORM returns #NUM! error.\n


better:
    p(x) dx = {1 over (b-a)} dx
    for a <= x < b

    p(x) dx = 0
    otherwise

or something similar
-------------------------------
EOMONTH

The arguments:  start_date and months in description should have a '@'
character in front:

* EOMONTH returns #NUM! if start_date or months are invalid
-------------------------------
Double negation in:

#: src/dialogs/dialog-solver.c:747
msgid 
Sensitivity nor limits report are not meaningful if the program has
integer 
constraints. These reports will thus not be created

should be (remove 'not'):
Sensitivity nor limits report are meaningful if the program has integer

constraints. These reports will thus not be created

or:
Sensitivity and limits report are not meaningful if the program has
integer 
constraints. These reports will thus not be created

2. Go to old site 
3. Go to new site 
4. Compare
5. Make the browser window even smaller mayb 40 px wide.
6. Compare

Actual result:
Step 4: Old site looks just fine. New site causes vertical scrollbars and
the main content is off the screen. You need to scroll vertically to be
able to read the content at all.
Step 6: Old site now has vertical scrollbars like the new site earlier
had but at least the whole text still fits in the window after you
scrolled. With the new site the text is wider than the window so you have
to scroll vertically for *every* *single* *line* you want to read. This is
totally unnecessary because the text itself would fit perfectly in the
400px wide window but because of the table around it other content which
is wider and the way current browsers work the text is as wide as the
widest content.

Expected result:
No vertical scrollbars (for text).",141,"0"
"EPIPHANY-348350","Switch to Tango-style icons and Icon Naming Standard named icons","Please describe the problem:
This is a placeholder theme about new style for Epiphany icons. I'll put here all info or pixmap we could need to make Epiphany a Tango-ided application.

We have to:
  1. use named icons following Icon Naming Standard both for icons yet available in gnome-icon-theme and for custom epiphany icons
  2. draw custom epiphany icons using Tango guidelines.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Choose Tango or the new GNOME icon theme in Theme preferences tool
2. Start Epiphany
3. Select View->Toolbars->Customize


Actual results:
Old sytle icons are mixed with new ones :-)

Expected results:
All icons should follow the Tango guidelines (now GNOME guidelines too)

Does this happen every time?
Yes of course

Other information:
In the next days I'll spend some time searching in Epiphany sources for icon names trying to identify icons we could fetch directly from Icon Naming Standard and custom icons we need to provide with epiphany.

Of course I'll add jimmac to this bug :-)",709,"1"

"EVOLUTION-210886","contact list users disappearing","Package: Evolution
Priority: Major
Version: 0.14.99 +cvs.2001.09.25.08.08
Synopsis: contact list users disappearing
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Contacts [was: Addressbook]

Description:
i have noticed that when forwarding/sending emails and choosing the
contacts
from the list sometimes (well most of the time) unselected ones
disappear. This is a
pain because i cant select one by one. Doing so causes users to
disappear from the left side even if they arent chosen destinations..

i guess this is hard to explain but the only way around it is to select
all the recipeients holding ctrl then pressing TO..

if you have any questions about this please contact me and i will try
to clarify it.

ALSO

I have been beta testing evolution all summer (if not before that) and
no matter what
build i always have to click OK acknowledging that i am using a beta
version. I know 
this and so does every other beta tester. Is there anyway that I can
turn off that 
welcome message so that i dont have to click OK every time?

thanks

"EVINCE-347213","Scrolling across page boundary is jerky","Please describe the problem:
Using the mouse wheel (while in 'Fit page width' mode) to scroll down across a page boundary can cause a quick jump to place the next page at the top. This happens when the next use of the scroll wheel will cause evince to scroll slightly past the top of the next page but then the page suddenly jumps back up to the top.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a multi-page PDF in 'Fit page width' mode
2. Scroll down slowly onto the second page
3. As the page changes over watch for sudden movement
--
4. If it doesn't occur try resizing the window vertically so that the display is not a whole number of scrolls high (just move it a bit and try again)

Actual results:
As the page changes over the top of the second page is scrolled past slightly but then the page jumps suddenly to be aligned at the top.

Expected results:
One of two behaviours:
1) Don't make the page jump back up. If the top of the next page is scrolled past a few pixels don't do anything. Or:
2) When a scroll event is detected immediately align the next page to the top instead of letting it scroll past first (This avoids the 'flash' as the display quickly over-corrects).

Does this happen every time?
Only when the top of the next page is not a whole number of scrolls away. Since if the top of the next page is already aligned with the window you don't see any effect.

"TOTEM-337232","Totem screen gets smaller when repeatedly hididing/showing controls","Please describe the problem:
When repeatedly hiding/showing controls in a window that plays a movie that has
been stretched over original resolution the window gets smaller when following
the steps described.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a movie / start playing
2. Hit H repeatedly



Actual results:
Each hide show cycle makes the window smaller. Hide retains the original size
but show tries to fit the controls in the new smaller space.

Expected results:
When hiding controls I (intuitively) expect that the size left will be taken
over by the content.

When a user resizes a window it means that he wants it to fit on some size. I
understand that keeping the content size when hiding controls is meant to be
less disruptive but the combined user experience is frustrating.

Does this happen every time?
Only happens when movies are streched above their native resolution.

"EPIPHANY-150266","Default charset gconf change isn't applied instantly","I've accidentally changed /apps/epiphany/web/default_encoding to a garbage value
(ISO-8851-1). When noting that all pages that don't provide explicit codeset
information and use non-ASCII characters look really weird I decided to change
it back using gconf. Epiphany was running at that time view->encoding->auto
being enabled. The pref dialog was open showing Unknown (ISO-8851-1) in
language->encodings->default.
Now after changing it back the combo didn't change. So I closed the pref
dialog and re-opened it again. Now it showed Western (ISO-8859-1) correctly.
When filling a form on the currently open webpage again the resulting page
still contained garbage because view->encoding was *still* set to Unknown
(ISO-8851-1). Obviously some signal handlers need to be connected to correctly
reflect gconf changes instantly.
Enough bug prosa for today.

"GUCHARMAP-349249","section on browsing is too wordy","3.5. To Browse Through all Characters is unnecessarily complex.

There is no need to list every possible action in the Go menu. This makes the section very hard to read and take in.
Instead of:

Choose Go → Next Script or Go → Next Block to select the next character set. 
Choose Go → Previous Script or Go → Previous Block to select the previous character set.

this should suffice:

Use the Go menu to browse through the character map by individual character or by script.

"GNOME-PANEL-348833","Errors in .desktop file break bug-buddy support","The ./applets/notification_area/GNOME_NotificationAreaApplet.server.in.in file has the following problems:
 - Lacks (valid?) X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component (make sure to get the case exactly
right)
 - No version information (optional but recommended)

Currently contains: Notification Area Applet. Should be notification area.

Full reason why this is needed:

Starting with Bug-Buddy 2.15.0 all programs wanting to make use of Bug-Buddy must have a .desktop file. Also the .desktop file must contain a few Bug-Buddy headers.

These are:
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME <-- Mandatory
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=XXX <--Mandatory
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=YYY <-- Mandatory
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-OtherBinaries=ZZZ <-- Optional only if you
application has several binaries
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version=X.Y.Z <-- Optional but highly recommended. This should need expansion from configure script so if you want this you need a
application.desktop.in.in to expand here @VERSION@
(application.desktop.in is used by intltool for translations).

This headers have actually been in use since 2002 except that Bug-Buddy 2.15.0 will now require:
a) A .desktop file containing at least the mandatory information
b) Given product and component MUST exist on bugzilla.gnome.org

Having the X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version is optional but highly recommended. The server will automatically change versions like 2.15.90 to 2.15.x so this doesn't have to be changed in the .desktop file. I recommend keeping the real version in the desktop file as I might put this in a comment.

Users will only be able to fill in their email address and a 'What were you doing when the application crashed?'. Version information will not be possible to select anymore. This is why having the X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version is highly recommended.

If you want Bug-Buddy support but do not want your application to show up in the menus use the following .desktop header:

  XkbStateNotify event

- The call XkbSelectEventDetail() can be used to specify when exactly the

------- Additional Comments From rebecka@eazel.com 2000-08-02 19:37:21 ----

i think this can be solved here by two things:
1. use of the seteuid command to set the indexer to be able to read the nfs
mount in cases where it does not have access.
2. fixing the eventual permissions filtering to not automatically give back
root everything and use the search daemons status as root to do a direct
access call instead.



------- Additional Comments From rebecka@eazel.com 2000-08-02 23:08:46 ----

i added commands to find and skip nfs mount points for now.
we can do more in this vein if we realize we need to.

------- Additional Comments From victor@eazel.com 2001-02-15 15:11:45 ----

I'm not sure if this is serious enough to be considered a Must for 1.0 but it
is a very high want. It is very common for corporate users to have their home
directory in the server and nfs-mounted on their system. This is what we do here
at Eazel and I can't search my files. 

Does the medusa-indexd with the --folder= option serve as a workaround? 

Cheers Victor

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub gnome/source/Gconf/2.3/GConf-2.3.2.tar.bz2

After building  the ORBit-2.7.2 I would try to rebuild that 
so It happened build error with backends/makeup-tree.c

So I checked cvs tree it seems to forgotten to apply patch to that file in that tarball.

"GSTREAMER-132045","incorrect dependency causes rebuilding of libgstreamer on make install","When I build an rpm for GStreamer I do the usual
./configure ... make make install routine as suggested elsewhere.
However on make install I see that a part of the build tree including
libgstreamer-0.7.la gets rebuilt. This can be nasty because a typical
run make install rpm macro in many distributions relocates $(libdir) and
other makefile variables to a temporary install root. As the result the
rebuilt libstreamer-0.7.la gets this bogus libdir setting written into it
and by the time a dependant libgstcontrol shared library is installed it
gets relinked with a bogus rpath. A pedantic packaging verify script frowns
at such things.

The cause of the problem was tracked down to the following rule in
'gst/parse/Makefile.am':

lex._gst_parse_yy.c: parse.l grammar.tab.h
        $(FLEX_PATH) -P_gst_parse_yy $^

'grammar.tab.h' is rebuilt by a bison invocation _after_ the first flex
invocation at the make stage making the target stale. In fact this
header file doesn't affect the flex's output and should never be made a
dependency in this rule in the first place.",14,"0"

"GCONF-56408","GConf does not build on Solaris-2.5.1","Hi

GConf does not build on Solaris-2.5.1 due to the following reasons:

* snprintf is not available on Sol-2.5.1

* uint32_t is not available on Sol-2.5.1

configure already tests for glib version so an obvious
solution to 1 would be to use g_snprintf aka g_vsnprintf.

uint32_t can be defined using autoconf.

The diffs below modify GConf-1.0.1 i tried to keep compatibility
with other environments as much as possible and to break nothing.

Another bug is that GConf cannot be make install -ed several
times. make install complains about a symlink already existing
when started the second time.

Here the diffs:

"GTK+-357078","Crash while dragging a mail message to another folder","Distribution: My Linux release 3.5 (Rainbow)
Package: Evolution
Severity: Normal
Version: GNOME2.14.2 2.8.x
Gnome-Distributor: Red Hat Inc
Synopsis: Crash while dragging a mail message to another folder
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Calendar
Bugzilla-Version: 2.8.x
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.14.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:
I was in the process of dragging a message from my Sent Items folder to
one of its subfolders when the crash occurred.  This was a fluke
occurrence because I had just seconds before moved another message from
the Sent Items folder to another subfolder.

If it makes any difference the message that I had completed moving was
the last message in the Sent Items folder and the one I had started to
drag was the second to last.  The status bar at the bottom reads
Fetching summary information for new messages in CSaenz (100%
complete) (that's the folder I had dropped the previous message into).

Also Evolution has been spending a lot of time re-fetching summary
information for each new folder I use because our office has just
replaced the mail server and the new server has a different host name. 
I'm using IMAP and apparently it isn't smart enough to reuse the
.evolution/mail/imap/... cache from the previous account settings when I
change the login name host name or even port number even though the
remote mail store is always the same.


Steps to reproduce the crash:
I don't know if this can be easily reproduced but I'm guessing:
1. Set up some large folders on an IMAP server.
2. Change the host name or port used to access the same IMAP server
(e.g. by using a proxy)
3. Open up one of the folders
4. Drag a message to one of the other folders
5. Drag another message to a different folder


How often does this happen?
First time.  As I said I had dragged other messages to different
folders before without crashing.


Additional Information:
I had recently (3 months ago) upgraded to Gnome 2.14.2.  Just earlier
this week (at the same time the office was upgrading the mail server
from MS Exchange 2000 to MS Exchange 2003) I upgraded evolution from
2.6.2 to 2.8.0.

I was completely inable to get evolution 2.8.0 to connect to the IMAPS
server it kept saying SSL unavailable.  I was able to connect by
setting up an SSL proxy using stunnel on my local machine.

"GEDIT-325691","Remarks concerning incremental search and “go to line”","After discussing these on #gedit here is a summary of a few remarks concerning
the new widgets used for incremental search (Ctrl+K) and “go to line” (Ctrl+I):

About discoverability:

Ctrl+K does not have a menu entry so it isn't very discoverable. Anyway that's
not really a feature which would have place in a menu. That's fine. But Ctrl+I
has one. Anyway it's a bit strange to click on a menu entry and to see nothin
happens. This is perhaps due to the fact that the widget appears under the menu
so nothing move and you don't even notice the widget because it is quite small.
Perhaps you should put the widget elsewhere (e.g. at the bottom as for TreeView)

About timeout:

Both widgets (Ctrl+I Ctrl+K) disappear after a given period. This is an
annoying behaviour if you don't type fast enough. This is also annoying when you
look around the match to see if it is the one you were looking for. This makes
the Prev/Next capability quite useless since you don't have the time required to
use it. The widget should only disappear when hitting  or when the focus
is lost (and eventually provide some close button but it is far from required imho)

About how to use it:

The cursor always come back to its starting point unless you hit . This
is weird combined to the timeout and this is really annoying when you click on
the text to edit it : the text view scrolls back to anywhere but where the text
you want to edit is. I think it should only scroll back when hitting 
or at least not when you click on the text buffer.

1) Start ghex. Click on Applications-> Accessories-> Hex Editor
2) Open a new file by clicking on File->Open and selecting a new file
3) Edit the opened file by adding some new changes
4) Now logout by clicking on Actions->Log Out

"NAUTILUS-46505","Nautilus Music Preview (NMP) will sometimes play its targeted file indefinitely","NMP will sometimes play it's targeted file indefinitely while while Nautilus is
busy scanning files in the current folder or changing the view mode from View
as Icons to View as List.  The latter might be due to the same reason as the
first Changing the view mode from View as Icons to View as Music works as
expected.
The window of opportunity for this bug is very specific and is sensitive to
system load ( CPU & DISK ). **I'll this in the steps need reproduce this bug


* REPRODUCIBLE: Sometimes

* STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

** The following steps are not neccessary but they help to make things easier.

1. Open two terminals.
2. In one run top ( terminal1 ).
** I use top to monitor for runaway instances of mpg123 or sox.
3. I use the second terminal ( terminal2 ) to kill mpg123 or sox when
nautilus fails to so.

** neccessary steps
Case One:
1. Start Nautilus.
2. Go to a folder ( folder1 ) which contains some music files and at
least one subfolder ( folder2 ).
** The more items in folder1 the better.  This very important
the more items nautilus has to scan the high the probability
one has in reproducing this bug.
3. Locate a music file ( music1 ).
4. Now this the tricky part.  Double click on folder1 then quickly
move the mouse pointer over music1.
** The quickly part has to be done very fast!!!.  One must have
placed the mouse pointer over music1 before Nautilus changes
the currently displayed folder ( folder1 ) to folder2 and
NMP must have enough time to initiate a preview.  Check for
instances of mpg123 or sox using top running in terminal1
again NMP sometimes takes several seconds before it actually
start to play music1 but by using top one could instantly
see if mpg123/sox started and the go on to linger.
*** Tbis is the window of opportunity for this bug that I
referred to in the Description for this bug.
Case Two:
1. kill any runaway mpg123 or sox instances if one has not already
done so.
2. Go back to folder1.
3. Locate music1.
4. Switch nautilus view mode to View as List then quickly move the
mouse pointer over music1.
** Read the comments for Case One step 4 if one has to.  I think
the bug is happening here for the same reason.

Case Three:
1. Repeat the steps neccessary to reproduce this bug for Case Two
but replace step 4 with the following step.
2. Click on the refresh button then quickly place the mouse pointer
over music1.

Case Four:
1. Repeat the steps neccessary to reproduce this bug for Case Two
but replace step 4 with the following step.
2. It is neccessary to remember the exact position of the icon for
music1.
3. Double click on folder2.
4. Click on the back botton then quickly move the pointer over to
the remembered position for the icon of music1.
** This sort of the reserve of Case one.

Case Five:
1. Repeat the steps neccessary to reproduce this bug for Case Two
but replace step 4 with the following step.
2. It is neccessary to remember the exact position of the icon for
music1.
3. Switch nautilus's view mode to View as List.
4. Switch nautilus's view mode back to View as Icons then quickly
move the mouse pointer over the remembered position of music1 icon.
** This sort of the reserve of Case Two.


* ACTUAL RESULTS:

 NMP ( Nautilus Music Preview ) will sometimes fail to stop playing music1 for
all cases.


* EXPECTED RESULTS:

  NMP should stop playing music1 when it is expected to do so.


This bug is very sensitive to system load( CPU & DISK).  Hence on a very fast
machine with a lot memory the window of opportunity will be smaller if not
nonexistent if said machine is fast enough and also have no other running
processes in background( Mozilla is very good for hogging memory especially with
java installed and medusa-indexd is good at hogging I/O ) .  Also make sure
that the folder ( folder1 ) and subfolder ( folder2 ) have a lot of items.
I also found that running nautilus with gdb made the reproducibility of this
bug almost always

Thanks for the very thorough bug report!

This is annoying but according to Gene it's exceptionally hard to reproduce. 
I'm moving this to post 1.0.1 for investigation.  I don't think it's a 1.0
blocker.




------- Additional Comments From reginald@mailvision.net 2001-02-13 21:28:46 ----

Additionally I have found another way to reproduce this bug.

1. Start Nautilus
2. Go to a folder ( folder1 ) that contains some music files.
3. Locate a music file ( music1 ).
4. Create a new window then quickly do the following.
5. Move the mouse pointer over music1 then click once on it. This will bring
   the first window ( window1 ) back in focus.  This is neccessary because if
   window1 is not in focus this procedure will not reproduce this bug.  As a
   matter of fact Nautilus Music Preview will not preview ( play ) music1 if
   the latter is not done.

   ** I suggest that one repeat this whole procedure a couple of times.
      Nautilus seem to slow down quite a bit after I created ten windows.  The
      probability of reproducibility seems to go up with each new window
      created. 



------- Additional Comments From tmgeorgo@io.com 2001-03-03 21:02:53 ----

I've encountered this bug *many* times and it happens to me simply by starting
nautilus switching to a folder full of MP3s in icon view and mousing over the
song until it starts playing.  The song continues playing after I move the mouse
away from the icon.  Then I can move to another MP3 icon wait the required
time and that song will start playing too without interrupting the first
song.  On the build I'm currently running (Mar3:07:32:30) I was able to have 6
songs going at the same time.  The only way to stop them is to use killall
mpg123 and this always results in zombie processes.  Immediately after killing
the 6 songs I was able to start 3 more again simultaneously (and maybe even more
if I tried but the sound was terrible! )

In my case I have a single nautilus window open no subfolders within the folder
where this occurs and 23 MP3 files.

Important: I found out that this bug appears too if Nautilus is painting my
desktop. Then you have to go to ANY forlder containing some mp3 files start
playing one sample then moving to the other file and you end up with a lot of
mpg123 instances running and a nice sound around.

Description:
When editting a message Evolution now leaves a bunch of stray

(because
you are replying for instance) the characters at the end of long lines
are not
clear off.

Synopsis: GnomeCard import is incomplete

Bugzilla-Component: Importers

Description:
When importing from GnomeCard the are some unecpected behaviour.

a. Address information as in street po boc city and postal code 
    seems to be omitted totally.

b. Phone numbers marked as Work (presumably quite common) in
    GoneCard gets imported as category Company. It should much
    rather be imported as Business since the contact editor defaults to
    showing Business only. This essentially semi-hides the imported
    company info.

------- Additional Comments From darin@bentspoon.com 2000-08-02 17:29:48 ----

There are FIXMEs about this in nautilus-file.c.

We need to change this to use a callback to report success/failure as the other
related calls in nautilus-file.c like nautilus_file_set_permissions.

It's possible we can just remove this function instead since we do Empty
Trash now instead of Delete.

"SAWFISH-123484","Charset conversion issue when running in UTF-8 locale (patch)","[[ This bug report is a verbatim copy of a mail I send to John Harper a
month ago and for which I did not receive any answer. I suppose he's busy
with something else :-) ]]


Lately I noticed that sawfish sometimes fails to display 8-Bit characters
(e.g. German umlauts) when I'm running it in UTF-8. I'm using the XFT font
mode.

While investigating I found that Sawfish handles window titles in an
inconsistent way:

1. When a window is first created in function add_window. SF calls
XmbTextPropertyToTextList and gets a string in current locale encoding (for
me: UTF-8).

2. When a window is retitled after being created in function 
property_notify. SF uses XmbTextPropertyToTextList or simply copies a
XA_STRING format property byte by byte. XmbTextPropertyToTextList produces
UTF-8  (same as in 1) but the XA_STRING copying produces Latin-1. Most of
the time the XA_STRING case occurs and Latin-1 is produced.

Consequently we never know what encoding the window title really has. SF
doesn't seem to make any attempt at correcting this inconsistency.

The next problem is XFT's XftDrawString8 function which can't cope with
multibyte encodings. At least that's what I guess from its source code - I
couldn't locate any documentation which actually specifies that.

To make the long story short: Windows which are created (as opposed to
renamed) with an non-ASCII title in a UTF-8 locale with XFT fonts don't get
their titles displayed correctly. To reproduce this you can use Xdialog
for example:

 	killall sawfish LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 sawfish &
 	Xdialog --title AÄOÖUÜ --msgbox 0 0 0 &

It is only a coincidence (IMO) that renamed windows are displayed
correctly. In fact it's a bug in Sawfish which is hidden by XFT.

To resolve this problem I propose

a) not to copy XA_STRING properties literally. This way we always get
window titles in current locale's encoding.

b) call XftDrawString8 and XftDrawStringUtf8 according to the current locale.

This approach seems to work for me[TM] and doesn't seem to mess up single
byte locales either. It probably still won't work correctly for other
multibyte encodings. The cleanest approach might be to use UTF-8 or some
other form of unicode everywhere.

Please see the attached patch for more details. I would like to hear your
comments. Please forgive any massacres I have committed in your code. :-)

wrong with the autoconf magic... I can't test if the patch still works
properly. ]]",1785,"1"
"GOSSIP-347026","groupchat topic is changed local even though user have not the permission","Please describe the problem:
You can change the groupchat topic even you have not the permission. Of course the conference server didn't accept it but gossip ignores the error message. Also the topic shown to the user is different as the real groupchat topic. I have no idea how a clean error handling could be. A system message in the groupchat dialog in red or something and setting back the topic. Maybe it's possible to check if the user have the permission to change the topic and depend on this permissions activate or deactivate the entry field. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Join a groupchat with no permission to change the topic
2. change the topic
3. compare the topic with the topic in the same room in another client at the same time


Actual results:
The topic presented to the user is not the correct one.

Expected results:
An error message and reset the topic to the correct one.

"GTHUMB-142898","Categories window does not remember size or position","To reproduce:
1.  Select at least one image
2.  Click on the Categories button in the toolbar or choose Edit -> Categories
from the menu (the behaviour is the same either way)
3.  Reposition and/or resize the Categories window.
4.  Close the window by choosing OK or Cancel (the behaviour is the same either way)
5.  Reopen the Categories window.  It has now forgotten it's size and position
and will reopen in the same place and size as before.

This is very annoying.  I have more categories (20 or so) that fit into the
default view so I am frequently required to scroll down to select my desired
choice.  I would like to be able to make the Categories box bigger (well
longer) so that I don't have to scroll each time.  

Also the window does not remember it's position.  This means it opens up in the
middle of my screen each time -- often right above the photo I want to work on!
 I would like to place the box off to one side (in my case the left).  That
way it would not keep reopening in a way that obscures my photos.  I recognize
that there is a risk that having the window remember it's position would cause
it to be off screen if i switch from a large resolution to a small resolution. 
I know that on Mac OS X a program can tell if it is trying to place a window
off-screen and can then re-position it to the center.  If that is not possible
then perhaps an ALT-click on the toolbar Categories button or a button under
the Interface area of the General tab of the gThumb prefrences window labeled
return all windows to default positions would make sense.",213,"0"

"NAUTILUS-SENDTO-334587","Possible crasher on startup","If libbtctl can't initialise the Bluetooth device then nautilus-sendto will crash on startup (usually while loading the interface).

The problem is that if libbtctl fails it will create a new GQuark using g_quark_from_static_string. And the GModule documentation says:

If your module introduces static data to common subsystems in the running program e.g. through calling g_quark_from_static_string (my-module-stuff) it must ensure that it is never unloaded by calling g_module_make_resident().


So using g_module_close on the bluetooth plugin will remove a quark from a static string and crash nautilus-sendto whenever another quark is registered.

The attached patch adds the never_unload struct member so that modules that say so can't be unloaded.

It also fixes:
- don't use home-made str_has_suffix we have g_str_has_suffix
- use g_dir_open instead of opendir
- don't leak the plugins directory on startup
- mark as static functions that are not used anywhere else
- namespace the plugins so as to avoid clashes with system libraries confusing the hell out of libtool (libbluetooth.so is the generated library as well as the system bluetooth library)
- use GError properly in the bluetooth module
- Fix a couple of warnings in the evo plugin",23,"0"

ASCII-only names don't help translators since the translator of language A
rarely would realize the proper name for obscure airport Z in country B after
the name has been mangled though an ASCII-only filter. As an example the
Swedish rather small city Trollhättan should most likely be spelled the same
way in German. It's however unlikely that a German translator realizes this
though if the name is mangled to Trollhattan.

I would argue that ASCII-only names here don't even help English-speaking
people since if they are looking for a small airport they'll be a lot more
successful using it's proper name (if they don't have access to the code).

The first sentence makes absolutely no sense. I'd try Ekiga cannot apply one or more changes to the current call. Your new settings will take effect for the next call.

You call it Ekiga.net elsewhere. And making .NET in all-caps looks like it's screaming to me. Either make all the references be Ekiga.net or Ekiga.NET. I'd strongly suggest not capitalizing any of it and making it just ekiga.net like URLs are normally written.

This contains a couple grammar errors including a sentence that's too long to make sense of. I'd suggest:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this first create an account at the URL below. Enter your account number and password (where? in Ekiga? at the registration page? on a piece of paper?) and then enable registering to the Ekiga PC-To-Phone service.\n

The service will work only if your account is created using the URL below.

Please note also that enable registering to the Ekiga PC-To-Phone service makes absolutely no sense and I have no idea what to even suggest that you change it to.

1. Yaphala
---------------
a. The string  is rendered incorrectly. For some
reasons the Yafala mark
is getting rendered twice.    
    More information on yaphala can be found at

* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-05-31 21:30:

Here is a small patch for 1a. This seems like a problem with indic-ot not 
just Bengali. I am not quite sure if the patch is correct for other languages 
but it works for Bengali and I am hoping it will give Owen some 
indication about what is the real problem. 

* Additional Comments From Owen Taylor 2003-06-01 01:22:

I don't think the patch is quite right having multiple post
base forms is allowed in Bengali I believe and your
patch will prevent such cases from rendering correctly.

See: 

http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/icu/source/layout/IndicReordering.cpp.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.9

For how the problem was fixed in ICU. The immediately relevant
part of the patch is the change:

- while (baseConsonant >= baseLimit) {
+ while (baseConsonant > baseLimit) {

But probably the other parts of the patch need to be ported to 
Pango as well.

* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-06-01 01:32:

I am quite sure (99%) you can't have multiple post-base in Bengali (I am 
not sure about other indic languages). In Bengali only 0x09AF has 
post-base form and I haven't seen any word where it repeats itself. I am 
not sure how to test the other languages. 
 
I'll try out what you mentioned Owen but I doubt I can port all the 
changes from ICU to Pango anytime soon... 

* Additional Comments From Taneem Ahmed 2003-06-01 02:10

Okay seems like there weren't too many ICU changes for the reorder 
function. Attached is the port of the diff you pointed out. Please take a 
look and see if you can come up with an official patch some time soon. 

* Additional Comments From Owen Taylor 2003-06-01 04:04

I've attached two copies of a version of version of
your backport - the first for legibility is with diff -w
(ignore whitespace)the second is a diff that can be applied.

Changes from your version:

 - Remove 'if (lastConsonant >= prev) {' and reindent
 - Get the other part of the ICU change (remove pstf from base
   consonants) as well.
 - Remove code that you only #if 0'ed.

If you could check whether this fixes 1a for you that
would be appreciated.",373,"1"

Description:
I have two appointments that recur on the last Thursday and the last Friday of every month.

I am given the option of the 4th and 5th weekday of each month.  This is not the same thing.  Thus this bug report.

I tried selecting the 5th weekday of each month but that only listed an appointment in the months that had a 5th weekday.  And I suppose would have been a bug in itself.

"GTKSOURCEVIEW-579196","Syhtax coloring of << left shift in perl fails.","Please describe the problem:
Syntax coloring using the perl language in gedit 2.24.2 with ubuntu gnome 2.24.1.
The << operator meaning shift left is being misinterpreted as a HERE document which has a very similar format.


Steps to reproduce:
*** Test code ***
#!/usr/bin/perl
$aa = 15
$cc = $aa >> 2
$bb = $aa << 2  # This was syntax colored as a HERE document.
$pp = $aa * 4
$ss = $aa + 4
print $aa $bb $cc $pp $ss\n
print << ENDPRINT
This works as expected
damnit.
ENDPRINT
print <<ENDPR # This elicits an error with a space after the <<s.
With no space and no quotes.
ENDPR
__END__


Actual results:
Coloring is incorrect after << operator until next blank line.

Expected results:


Does this happen every time?
Yes

    )
  

*** Further problems ***
The patch is not perfect. A look at page 66 of the Camel book on perl ed-3 shows other options and this change just makes perl users use the _ pair when it's not always necessary. If it's really necessary to use an end of file string that can be confused with a numeric value of an integer result of a function there will be more problems.

Version: 1.0.51

Hi

apperantly gtcd doesn´t check if the trackfont could be loaded. After a 
system upgrade I tried to use gtcd with the old configuration file that now 
pointed to an invalid (because nonexistant) font and gtcd crashed on startup. 
Replacing the font description in the configuration file solved the problem.

I would commit a fix but I don't have a recent checkout of gnome-media and I 
have no clue what branch this fix should go into. It should be trivial 
however...


Salut Sven

In OpenMAX all the buffers are allocated during the setup with either an OMX_UseBuffer or an OMX_AllocateBuffer call. These calls also create a buffer header which is a structure whose pBuffer member points to the actual memory buffer. This member is read-only and should not be modified.
During the processing inside gst-openmax plugins pBuffer is overwritten (see gstomx_base_filter.c line 500 of the latest release 0.10.0.2). 
These buffers have different addresses and size compared to what has been declared with OMX_UseBuffer(). This behavior is against the OpenMAX spec and can cause errors.

"GTKMM-138248","Book: manage() used before it is explained.","I had trouble trying to understand the memory management strategy employed by
gtkmm by reading through the docs.  I first read the FAQ and then the 22
chapter tutorial (plus some of the appendices).  Here's what I thought was
confusing:

First by reading the FAQ (specifically part 4 of question 1.4) I saw the
statement that As a C++ coder you know that pointers should be avoided where
possible.  That made me believe that smart pointers would probably be employed...

I was reading through the tutorial and came across tutorial/html/ch04s04.html
which used the 'manage' function with no explanation.  I had to google to find
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtkmm-list/2002-October/msg00102.html to start to
understand the example (and realize that my initial guess was unfortunately
wrong) though this email (and the few others I looked at) didn't quite answer
all my questions.

Finally I get to chapter 18 and it answers my questions abou memory management.
 Perhaps I started thinking about memory management a little bit earlier than
others would have but shouldn't there should at least be a comment back in
chapter 4 when manage is used stating that the manage function will be explained
in chapter 18?  Either that or remove the references to manage that appear
before chapter 18?

Also although chapter 18 answered my memory management questions up to that
point chapter 19 (Glademm and Libglademm) throw another wrench into the works
because nothing I can find states whether the user is responsible for
deallocating the pointers that are returned from get_widget and get_widget_derived.",235,"0"

"EVOLUTION-210334","evolution re-asks for password on tcp errors","Package: Evolution
Priority: Major
Version: cvs.2001.09.18.07.08
Synopsis: evolution forgets password on tcp error
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
I got a tcp error or temporary error from the mail server on pop3. 
Evolution asked for a new password I hit cancel.  Unfortunately I have
forgotten my password and the answer to the question that will reset
it.

This is bogus though on cancel evolution should remember the old
password just as netscape and mozilla do.

"GEDIT-PLUGINS-374543","[PATCH] External Tools: new storage","Here is a patch to enable a new storage system in External Tools. Unlike the current one (which is based on a sole XML file) the new one is based on flat files: each script stands in its own file and metadata are contained in a comment block in the script file. In short it looks a bit like nautilus scripts.

Among other things it brings those improvements:
 - ability to provide both system and local (user) tools at the same time
 - ability to write tools using other langages than the default shell
   (there is one in perl in the patch)
 - easy to share tools and get new ones (just copy the file)
 - easy to edit more complex tools (you can edit it in gedit directly)

The old dialog box remains functionnal (currently it can't remove or add new tools anyway) and the store code is ready to allow tools organised in tree (see bug #334967)

Functionnalities yet to code:
 - ability to add/remove tools from the manager

Functionnalities that may appear later in other patches:
 - actual handling of tool tree in the manager and in the menu creator
 - ability to disable tools
 - lockdown handling (especially: unability to save user tools)",6,"0"
"EVOLUTION-229273","imap doesn't load new messages in current folder on autocheck","So when Evo does its automatic mail checking it updates the folder tree
with the unread counts of all its folders. It used to be that the new
messages in the current folder would be added to the tree and loaded but
this has changed since we no longer get the current FolderBrowser passed to
us. So we don't know which folder's messages to load and we don't want to
load new messages in all folders since that will be a lot of extra network
traffic.

Any solution should also take into account the fact that Evolution can be
showing more than one mail folder at once thanks to opening new Evolution
windows.",15,"0"

"NETWORKMANAGER-763236","NetworkManager 1.1.X prevents tap devices created by SSH from getting an IPv6 link-local address","Hi!

I occasionally use SSH as a simple Layer-2-VPN solution with *only* IPv6 link-local addresses on the automatically created tapX devices. NM 1.0.X simply ignored these devices but NM 1.1.X seems to break this setup:

root@shepard:~# NetworkManager --version
1.1.91
root@shepard:~# ssh -N -o Tunnel=ethernet -o TunnelDevice=5:5 root@hammond &
[1] 3618
root@shepard:~# ip link set up dev tap5
root@shepard:~# ip address show dev tap5
7: tap5:  mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/ether ca:12:a8:e7:2d:45 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

As you can see the tap5 device does not have an IPv6 link-local address. Stopping NetworkManager fixes this:

root@shepard:~# systemctl stop NetworkManager
root@shepard:~# ssh -N -o Tunnel=ethernet -o TunnelDevice=5:5 root@hammond &
[1] 3644
root@shepard:~# ip link set up dev tap5
root@shepard:~# ip address show dev tap5
8: tap5:  mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/ether 56:3d:ae:7a:d6:7f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::543d:aeff:fe7a:d67f/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Now an IPv6 link-local address has successfully been assigned.

I had a quick look at the debug output of NetworkManager (--debug --log-level=debug) and it seems that it decides to fiddle with the /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/tap5/disable_ipv6 file for some reason. I'd be happy to provide detailed logs if requested but I think the issue is easy enough to reproduce. All you need is a SSH client/server root on both sides and the PermitTunnel setting enabled on the server.

Obviously patching configure.in would be better but hey who knows

Package: gnome-pilot
Severity: normal
Version: GNOME2.10.0 unspecified
Gnome-Distributor: Red Hat Inc
Synopsis: gpilotd crashes while syncing avantgo conduit
Bugzilla-Product: gnome-pilot
Bugzilla-Component: gpilotd
Bugzilla-Version: unspecified
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.10.0)
Description:
Description of the crash:

gpilotd crashes each time the avant go condiut is synchronized. Not sure
if this is a gpilotd problem or a conduit issue.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1.  Make sure gpilotd is running
2. Hotsync
3. Wait for crash dialog to appear when AvantGo conduit is being
syncrhonized

Expected Results:
The usual successful syncrhonization

How often does this happen?
Each time I hotsync. Has not always been an issue in the past so perhaps
this is some new problem or perhaps it might be related to the pages
the AvantGo conduit is fetching. Not entirely sure.

"EVOLUTION-229501","does not conform to the RFC when exporting addresses","Description of Problem:

when exporting an address/address book:
1. missing mandatory type VERSION
2. lines are not always split
3. lines are not split at the right position
2. lines are not split correctly


Steps to reproduce the problem:

1. export any address
2. specify a long address (100 characters for example)
3. specify a long address (100 characters for example)
4. specify a long address (100 characters for example)

Actual Results:

1. VERSION not present in a vcard address
2. a very long ADR would not be split (while LABEL
would be split for example)
3. value is split at 75th character instead of 75
character of content-line
4. line is split by inserting = CRLF

Expected Results:

1. VERSION=3.0
2. ADR should be split
3. LABEL should be split at 75th character of
content-line not 75th character of value
4. lines should be split by inserting CRLF WSP or
CRLF TAB

How often does this happen? 

always

One of the nasty things of evolution is the lack of importing previous mail. The only way (up till now) is to copy your previous mailboxes and all the stuff from a temporary place directly to the New Installed Evolution files e.g. Copy all mailings from a data folder to /home/username/.evolution.
Is their any other way?

"EVOLUTION_EXCHANGE-334900","importing complex meeting invitations into Exchange calendar crashes (e_cal_util_remove_instances: assertion `icalcomp != NULL' id == NULL in search_by_id_and_client())","When importing a certain ics file (attached) into my Exchange
calender evolution-exchange-storage first reports:
  (evolution-exchange-storage:26540): libecal-CRITICAL **: 
   e_cal_util_remove_instances: assertion `icalcomp != NULL' failed
multiple times then it crashes with a SIGSEGV.

That ics file is was originally created by Outlook but I stripped
personal information from it. It still causes the crash so I hope
you can reproduce it. Please note that it does not crash when importing
into the normal local calender.

In general the calender functionality in combination with Exchange
is not working reliably which is a critical issue for me. This here
is just one example.

I compiled Evolution via Garnome 2.14.0 with -g -O0 on a Suse 9.0
derivative running on x86.

Program received signal SIGSEGV Segmentation fault.

"GIMP-310426","Generated psd files do not pass the resolution to Photoshot correctly.","Please describe the problem:
If one has an image with x and y resolutions of 300 dpi does save as and
selects Photoshop image as the file type. If the resulting psd file is opened
in Photoshop Phoroshop Elements or preview in OSX the size will be incorrect
and consistent with a resolution of 72 pixels/inch.

Steps to reproduce:
1. File->New
2. Select as a template US-letter (300dpi)
3. File->Save as
4. Select Photoshop image and store.
5. Open with Photoshop - I tried Photoshop 7.0 and Photoshop Elements 2
6. Image->Resize->Image size and insect the size and resolution.


Actual results:
The image size was Width = 41.778 inches Height = 27.778 inches and Resolution
= 72 pixels/inch

Expected results:
Width = 8.500 Height = 11.000 and 300dpi

Does this happen every time?
Yes

you assume that all English grammar applies to all other languages of the

F-spot on PPC still seems to be riddled with bugs at version 0.4.1 on Gentoo Linux.  After managing to get it to compile with external dbus-sharp and dbus-glib-sharp I had a running program.  

When I try to do a slideshow of my photos the get a green tint (which I heard is from endienness?).  When I then hit esc the program crashes.

The program 'f-spot' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 5990 error_code 2 request_code 143 minor_code 9)
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Steps to reproduce:
1. Find a PPC machine with f-spot installed
2. Start f-spot
3. Click slideshow button
4. Watch for a bit to see the green pictures
5. Press escape to see the program crash


Actual results:
photos of little green aliens appeared then a crash.

Expected results:
cute Baby pictures that didn't look like little aliens.  When I hit the esc button expecting to return to browse mode from the slideshow.

Does this happen every time?
Yes

"GIMP-385523","Setup create ...\Gimp-2-0\share\gimp\gimp\....","Please describe the problem:
Windows XP:
1) I have deinstalled Gimp 2.1.8 and GTK 2.x.
2) I installed GTK 2.10.6-1 and Gimp 2.2.13
3) Starting Gimp 2.2.13 appears many errors that he didn't found some files
   (e:\programme\gimp-2.0\share\gimp\2.0\....)
4) I checked the path with the Win-Explorer and I see that the setup has created
   (e:\programme\gimp-2.0\share\GIMP\gimp\2.0\....)
INFO: So the setup has created a GIMP directory to much.
   

Steps to reproduce:
1. se above
2. 
3. 


Actual results:
Error-messages 

Expected results:


Does this happen every time?
Yes

Other information:
I have manually moved in the windows explorer the contents of \Share\Gimp\Gimp\ to \share\Gimp\. And now Gimp starts correctly. I hope the setup has nothing registred to \share\gimp\gimp.",0,"0"

"NAUTILUS-42666","History list under Go menu can grow too long and create usage problems","The history under the go menu keeps growing and the menu goes off the screen
after too many history items are in the menu.  There should probably be a cap on
the number of items in the history.

Also since the menu is drawn in respect to the screen and not with respect to
the application having a really long history list and then placing your
application by the bottom of the screen will have the effect of showing the menu
starting at the top of the screen.  This isn't necessarily a problem but since
the menu has now shifted location its too easy for the user to accidentally
click a history item as soon as they open the menu rather than just leaving the
menu open.

High priority because significant implementation changes may be required
depending on the resulting design.

Doh! Forgot to actually change the priority.

Moving to 1.0 since my answer won't be implimented 'til 1.0 or 1.0.1.

The idea is to group things into folders... like hourly and or daily...

If we decide we need a short-term fix we could arbitrarily cut off the list at
some length.



------- Additional Comments From sullivan@eazel.com 2001-04-03 13:25:29 ----

I did the short-term fix of cutting off the menu at an arbitrary length (50) for
now.

Priority: Normal
Version: 1.3.92
Synopsis: Selecting calendar from shortcuts takes me to Tasks
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Calendar

Description:
Description of Problem:
After syncing with palm m500 for the first time after upgrading to
1.3.92 I found that the calendar link sends me to tasks.. (now
permanent).. 

I don't know how relevent syncing the palm was because I didn't try the
calendar until after I had synced.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. syn ecal etasks and address book with synchronize conduit settings 
2. try to nav to the calendar from shortcuts
3. 

Actual Results:
You actually get naved to the tasks section with the calendar toolbar..
but even clicking day week or month view gives the tasks view


Expected Results:
Just want my goddamned calendar


How often does this happen?
permanent problem

make
make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/libgnomeprint-2.1.1

i.e. build it with one prefix install it to a different prefix.

They should go to

This feature of autotools is used by users of GNU Stow (as in the example
above).
(It is also used by the debian packaging of gnome print 1.116 and probably
other packaging systems)

"GTK+-324243","cannot choose hidden files","Please describe the problem:
if you want to attach a hidden file (if nautilus or file explorer don't show
hidden files) you can not select a hidden file to attach on a mail even if you
can choose the file with Ctrl-L and write the full file name the file-chooser
dialog won't accept it.

Steps to reproduce:
1. open evolution mailer
2. Ctrl-N for new mail message
3. click on toolbar to attach a file to message
4. on file-chooser Ctrl-L
5. write the hidden filename (e.g. .file.txt) and enter
6. now all hidden files are visible on file-chooser window
7. just hit ENTER or click Open button and nothing happens. the only way to go
of the window is to click Cancel or hitting ESCAPE.


Actual results:


Expected results:
attaching hidden file to mail

Does this happen every time?
yes

Audio device open for 44.1Khz stereo 8bit failed

Since fix to bug 144318 was checked in 

ed@capella ~ $ esd

i.e. the first audio device open attempt (44.1/2ch/16) succeeds. Then when
audio is sent to the device things go very wrong and there is considerable
distortion.

The change is that snd_pcm_open() is called with default card instead of
hw:0 or similar. In the default configuration (/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf)
pcm.default is a SND_PCM_TYPE_PLUG rather than an actual kernel device
(SND_PCM_TYPE_HW) and it seems this cannot handle sample rate conversion properly.

I admit that this may be an ALSA bug rather than an esd bug. However this should
be fixable within esd it used to work after all.

I suggest that within audio_alsa09.c: initAlsa() if default is passed as dev
the snd_pcm_type() of the snd_pcm_t handle be tested and if it equals
SND_PCM_TYPE_PLUG then close the handle and reopen with the hardware device
hw:0 for the card number (this can be retrieved by snd_pcm_info_get_card).

This will revert behaviour in most cases to that before bug 144318 so I don't
think regressions are likely. For the situation in bug 144318 itself the
reporter's .asoundrc has a hardware card so behaviour will not change.

Possibly this proposed fix might break someone's setup but if so they have a
weird setup and can be expected to know what to do. (Specify device in
/etc/esd/esd.conf as -d device like I have to do now as workaround.) My setup
is very common - commodity hardware etc. - so it should be expected to Just Work.",331,"0"
"EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-388788","Subtle bug in autotools checks for iconv","I'm guessing I'm the only one in the universe with a system weird enough to trigger this build bug:

configure.in does three things in regards to iconv:
  1) Check for any special --with-libiconv flag setting $ICONV_CFLAGS and
     $ICONV_LIBS if found
  2) Check if a program can *link* (which implies compile as well I guess)
     against -liconv adding -liconv to $ICONV_LIBS if so
  3) Checks to see if a simple program can compile link AND run with the above
     determined ICONV_CFLAGS and ICONV_LIBS

I think the logic from 2->3 is buggy -liconv should only be added to ICONV_LIBS if a program can compile link *and run* against -liconv.  The patch to fix this is trivial I'll attach it in a minute.  With the patch (and a similar one for evolution) everything builds and functions well for me.",111,"0"

Description:
When I switch from the single day view in the calendar to the week view

all of the alarms for that week up to the present time pop-up even
though they have already been dismissed.  Eg.  If I have a repeating
alarm for 8:30 am every business morning and it's now 12:00 pm on
Friday I will get 5 popup windows with the alert.  This also happens
with non-repeating events.

these both occur in gtkhscale.c gtkvscale.c and gtkscale.c

I managed to get it to build by removing the GtkScale *scale declaration in
gtk_hscale_get_layout_offsets() (declared as parameter) and by removing
g_return_val_if_reached() calls. I realise this is destructive and not the
correct solution but it enables compilation for me at least.",0,"0"
"PAN-364357","Repeated server error messages","When a server error is encountered the error message window keeps popping up every 3-4 seconds.  Further if you don't keep up with clicking the ok button to dismiss it multiple copies of the error window stack up.  Very annoying.

Unknown version 2.14.0 in product epiphany.  Setting version to 2.14.x.

",0,"0"
"GNOME-USER-DOCS-119799","Sasha's comments on GNOME 2.4 UG","Here are some comments on the beta version of GNOME 2.4 UG as ov August 13
- in no particular order.

------------
COMMENT 1 (general): have we solved the problem of cross-linking between
different chapters of UG? If not then it should be priority #1. If yes
then we should really use it extensively. In particaulr each section of
Chapter 2 (Overview) should have a link to a section which covers the
appropriate topic in more detail. I can help with addign these links if you
want. 


-------------
COMMENT 2: Chapter 4 section To add a launcher to the panel:

 only 2 launcher types Application and Link are described. What
 about other types such as directory and FSdevice  - assuming
 they are still there in GNOME 2.4? I think that *all* types shown in
 the dialog should be documented - or removed from the dialog. 

 In the same section:  in the listing of sample link commands one
 should provide a link to the full list of GNOME URI in Chapter 7
 section Accessing Special URI Locations. 

--------------
COMMENT 3: Chapter 7 section Accessing Special URI Locations: repeating for
each URI Opens the ... location in a file manager window looks
somewhat stupid. More importantly a description of what exactly this
location is should be more detailed. E.g.  exactly which applications
are shown in  all-applications:/// ? and in applications:///? If I
uderstand correctly applications:/// shows the contents of the
applications menu - but I do not know about all-applications. 

Also: a link to a section describing this location in detail should
be given. E.g. for burn:/// location the link to Chapter 7 section
Writing CD
	

-------------
COMMENT 4: Chapter 7 section Using removable media: AFAIK Nautilus
shows *all* removable media for which there is a line in /etc/fstab and
which are mountabel by user  -
including those not in the list given here (Audio CD...Memory
stick). For example so-called disk-on-key usb portable storage
devices - this is not the same as memory stick. Or tape drives (assuming it
is user-mountable)

Also: it is a FAQ if the name and icon  used by Nautilus for removable
media object  on the desktop (e.g. CD-ROM) can be changed. AFAIK the
answer is no - maybe we should mention it here. 
-------------
COMMENT 5: Chapter 7 section To format a floppy diskette:
 >DOS (FAT): Select this option to format a diskette for use on
 Windows systems.  
It shoudl be mentioned that so formatted diskettes can also be used on
Linux/Solaris systems too. 

Also: this section leaves me puzzled as to what exaclty is the
difference between quick ( ...create only the file system on the
diskette) and standard (...create the file system on the diskette
and format the diskette). What is the difference between formatting
and creating file system? (well I know the answer but most users
do not). I'd add something like this : 

use quick if your dikette has ever been formatted before whether for
Linux or Windows (most likely case) use
standard if it has never been formatted (rare case) use thorough
if you want to verify that the diskette has not been damaged. 

-----------------
CCOMMENT 6: 
Chapter 8 table 8.1: one should provide links to sections describing
start here location (Chapter 2 section Start Here Location) and
Trash can (Using Trash on the Desktop) 

------------------
COMMENT 7: 
Chapter 8: when describing removing/changing properties of desktop
objects it shoudl be noted that special objects (Home Trash) can
not be removed. That is one can remove it but they are recreated at
next login anyway (at least in GNOME 2.2). I am not sure if any
changes (e.g. custom icons) are remembered. 

-----------------
COMMENT 8:
Chapter 7 section To Move a File or Folder to Trash and 
Chapter 8 section Using Trash on the Desktop: it shoud lbe noted
that when you use move an item on a mounted media (e.g. floppy) to
trash it still lives in trash can on the floppy - and thus takes
space on the floppy. If you want to free space on removable media you
need to empty trash. Otherwise users can be confused why they have no
items on a floppy yet get error message not enough space whentrying
to copy something to it. 

------------------
COMMENT 9: 
Chapter 7 section To set permissions: it may be noted that
permissions of a symlink are meaningless - the actual access rights
are determined by permissions of the target. 

-----------------
COMMENT 10:
Chapter 3 section To Log in to a Session in a Different Language: it
should be explained that this changes the language used by UI but *does
not* switch keyboard layout. Users who need to use  a different keyboard
should switch to it using a tool such as Kbd layout switcher applet or

This needs to be cleaned up as well as the current functions.  They were taken
from helix-install and I haven't had time to clean them up.  There are better
ways to do this I just don't want to waste too much time on it right now.

Actually the whole helixcodeutils stinks. Ill rewrite it into a
pretty distro finder.

Revamped and works for Redhat now.
Need to implement the rest of the determine_FOO_version
But as long as we're only aiming at Red Hat compability...

Setting all bugs to P6 to start official bug-prioritization plan. Please don't
set the priority to anything other than P6 unless you've got the gold seal of
approval for doing so.

Batch-assigning QA ownership of Services bugs to Albert.



------- Additional Comments From mjs@noisehavoc.org 2001-01-09 13:54:25 ----

For 1.0 we should at least detect other distributions so we can tell the user
what their distribution is when we tell them it's not supported.

Also Mandrake should be handled for shortly post-1.0 better to get it right
sooner rather than later.

Giving to Ian for 1.0 so he has something to do.




------- Additional Comments From yakk@yakk.net 2001-02-03 16:50:34 ----

Added version checking for Debian. All thats  missing now is a SuSE version
check. I'll have a poke at the test boxes at work.



------- Additional Comments From yakk@yakk.net 2001-02-04 22:34:20 ----

Added SuSE version check.

I'm closing this bug. I guess someone should re-open it if we decide we want to
support some new distros...

volatile (including locking-up the terminal and execution of shell- or
binary code) against special escape strings this can be very dangerous for
the average user. You might argue that this isn't a fault of glib. However
nearly all standard tools I now do not print unescaped control characters
to the terminal. Try 'ls' for example - not to mention apache. Functions
like g_log() g_warning() etc. are seldom (if at all!) considered to be
superfast. Escaping on the fly costs nearly nothing. Glib has even
functions for this (though this implies g_malloc()).

I highly assume g_object_set() is just one example. Thus I recommend to
escape all logging output by

How often does this happen?

Only when x- and y- values separated by 10 or more orders of magnitude.
Possibly problem with algorithm? - If this is so perhaps just a check
to make
sure the data is valid (i.e. not separated by 1e10) and to not do
calculations
if so rather than crash.

I ran it with 'xsltproc test.xslt test.xslt' and the result is a very 
strange element name and namespace that appear to come from invalid memory 
reads.

Using libxml 20507 libxslt 10030 and libexslt 720
xsltproc was compiled against libxml 20507 libxslt 10030 and libexslt 720
libxslt 10030 was compiled against libxml 20507
libexslt 720 was compiled against libxml 20507

In an attempt to further reduce the testcase I just noticed the removing 
the extra step with the second  in my:check() seems to work 
fine (i.e. ).",1136,"1"
"GTK+-155751","Typeahead/keynav comments","Have been eager to try out the typeahead/keynav features in HEAD but now that I
havethey aren't really quite what I was expecting.  A few comments:

- On / to bring up the location box... I don't have a problem with that but
it seems odd that it doesn't also type a / in the location box. Shouldn't one
goal of the keynav enhancements be that if I chose to I could just type the
full or relative (from the currently-displayed folder) pathname of a file as I
would in the old-style dialog hit Enter and have it open?  This way I have to
type the first / twice which feels wrong to me.

- Would be nice if typing ~ first at least changed the file/folder view to
your home directory.  Perhaps that should also pop up the location dialog too
(with ~/ already filled in) not sure about that though.

- On typing / in the search field... assuming I've typeaheaded (is that a
word?!) enough to match a folder in the current directory so it has become
highlighted and then I type / I would expect the file/folder list to change
to the folder whose name I've just typed.  Otherwise I've got no idea what to
type next without dismissing the search field hitting Enter to open the
folder and starting typing again particularly as there's no filename
completion in the search field.  This feels extremely inefficient.

- It might be nice if the file/folder list in the main dialog updated as I was
typing into the Location dialog to show the contents of the folder that the
Location dialog was currently auto-complete on.  I know strictly speaking all
the information you need is in the Location dialog iteself but it might make
the whole thing feel a bit more connected-- to me the location dialog still
feels like a bit of an afterthought to appease the keyboard junkies :)",219,"0"
"LIBWNCK-332264","Missing link against libXRes","libwnck/util.c uses XResQueryClientResources() and other XRes functions if HAVE_XRES is true but it does not link against libXRes. That means those symbols to be unresolved in the libwnck shared library which can cause undefined symbol errors when linking against libwnck. The linking issue arises from configure.in:

## Check for XRes
AC_CHECK_LIB(XRes XResQueryExtension
             X_LIBS=$X_LIBS -lXRes -lXext  AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(HAVE_XRES 1 [define if you have the XRes library]) 
             $X_LIBS -lXext)

The test knows that -lXRes is valid but then doesn't use it when compiling libwnck.

This is in libwnck-2.12.3 and also CVS HEAD.",626,"1"

The vcard output from evolution encodes multiple lines improperly.  Like
many of the vcard export problems I've noticed this behavior appears to
have been copied from MS Outlook rather than following the RFC.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.  Create a contact with a long note.
2. Export the card via File-->Save As VCard
3. Edit the resulting file.  

Actual Results:

NOTE:blah blah=
blah blah

Expected Results:

Should read as:

NOTEENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Blah blah.

It usually offsets the rectangle origin.

To verify:

add a guide snap a rectangle selection to one side of it
now strecth the rectangle iverting it to the other side of teh guide.

It does not happen every time but often enough to be annoying.

I've made a patch simplifying the inverting code and somewhat the resizing code so that it now works properly.

"EVOLUTION-213646","Focus change","Package: Evolution
Priority: Blocker
Version: 0.16.99 [+cvs.2001.10.24.21.46]
Synopsis: Focus change
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
There are several similar problems. On some sircumstances Evolution
changes the focus of one of its widgets when I do a virtual screen
switch or a focus switch to another program's window.

1) Reading a mail: I am reading a loong mail where I have to scroll up
and down the body. First I choose the mail folder in the tree view on
the left. then i choose the mail from the mail list on the top. Then I
have to click into the mail preview window which is below the mail
list. Finally I can use [Up] and [Down] keys of my keyboard to scroll
up and down.

I already submitted a bug that i would like to have the focus
immediately in the mail body frame after clicking on a mail from the
mail list. For [Up] and [Down] keys to scroll the mail instead of
selecting the next/prev mail in the list. Instead [Ctrl]-[Up] and
[Ctrl]-[Down] should be used to select another mail from the mail list.

Then I start reading the mail. Scroll down slowly. Then I have to switch
to another virtual desktop on Sawfish for some reason. After switching
back to my evolution virtual desktop the focus (i.e. the target where
keys are delevered to) has magically changed to the tree view. This
happens not all the time. Sometimes but then it is annoying enough. I
have to select the folder again and search the position i have stopped
reading the mail.

A similar behaviour happens if e.g. an ICQ windows pops up over
Evolution and i move the mouse into it (i have chosen: Focus:
Enter-only for Sawfish so i only have to move the mouse into the new
window) When I move it back to the evolution window or the icq message
disappears (on Close or Reply) the local focus inside Evolution has
changed too to the tree view.

Hmm now it won't happen again. :-) I am trying and trying but it
doesn't happen again. Strange. :-(

2) When I am writing a new email first entering the destination
address then the subject and finally the body leaving the email window
(which gives the focus to another window) and re-entering the email
composition window brings the entry focus to the subject editline
instead of giving it to the body field where i have been before.

This only happens first time i try this on a new email.

 - click New Message
 - enter destination address
 - press [Tab] twice
 - enter subject
 - press [Tab]
 - enter a little bit of the body
 - leave the email compose window with the mouse
 - enter it again
 - type a character -> it is in the subject line ( :-( )
 - click into the body field
 - type something
 - leave and enter the mail compose window with the mouse
 - local focus stays on the body field (how it should)

"EVOLUTION-233381","ldap address book searching when composing an new mail message","I've seen some huge progress in the ldap abilities/functionality in the more current releases but I still have a problem when I create a new message. When I click the box 'to' and I'm able to just add contacts by pointing and clicking from my personal address book but when I pick a different address book location and point it to my ldap addresses it doesn't see anyone nor will it allow me to search it from that dialog box. I can go to the ldap directory (not in the compose window but the standard evolution window) and pick individual people right click and send a message to them but when sending to more than one I have to cut and paste them. I know many people don't use this feature but for those of us who have computers at work home and a laptop on the road ldap is essential to keeping the addressbooks current. (Please don't give the old use rsync solution as it's just a hack work around for something that if you're gonig to allow me to choose my ldap address book it should work. Please help me out every time I get the last dev build or rc I hope it's fixed but it hasn't yet)

However GtkDialog's gtk_dialog_init instance-init function sets the type hint of the dialogue to GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DIALOG.

Steps to reproduce:
0) Create a GtkDialog
1) Check the Type Hint property: it says NORMAL but the dialogue will in fact be DIALOG

And since NORMAL is the 'default' value (in the pspec sense) you cannot set NORMAL explicitly since it's not saved to the .glade file.",4,"0"

"GTK+-457118","tablet problems when switching to/from fullscreen mode","When switching to and from fullscreen mode the cursor is offset from the point where any tool is actually used. (paint marquee blur paths etc. ) 

It goes like this: When the cursor is working properly in fullscreen mode and I switch to windowed mode the cursor is now offset to the upper-left by a few inches. When the cursor works properly in windowed mode and I switch to fullscreen the cursor is offset the same distance to the lower-right. 

To replicate this problem:

Create or open a file.
Press F11 to go to fullscreen.

At that point it is apparent the cursor is in the wrong place.


To get the cursor where it should be I have to hover it over a menu status bar or other non-canvas surface and then it is in the right position. This is a suitable solution for now. 

Note that if you use the Menu > View > Fullscreen button the cursor will still be in the right place in fullscreen. This bug only happens when I use the F11 shortcut or the ESC key to leave fullscreen mode.

I see no reference to this problem anywhere so it could be that somehow I screwed up things on my own side. So unless someone else can duplicate this I wouldn't bother looking for why its happening.

I usually call gthumb from nautilus to open a folder that has images most of
the time I want to see that images in fullscreen mode so I find myself always
doing these three steps:
 1º Open folder with gthumb (in nautilus)
 2º Selecting with the mouse the first image.
 3º Pressing F11 to open fullscreen.

 The second step should not be necessary and it's what annoys me if I open a
folder from nautilus and that folder contains images then is *obvious* that I
want to view that images and no other location so the thumbnail panel should
have the focus (or focus/select the first image) so the F11 shortcut works.

Evolution does not seem great at dealing with signed/encrypted emails 
I have two key pairs (secret and public) in my GPG ring I think this
may be related

Sending seems to work fine but it only automatically decrypts emails
which have been encrypted using the first key in the ring and not all
of them.  Others I have to copy out into a text file and use gpg from
the command line.

Also if I send a signed email that has attachments when I look at the
email in Evolution I am told that the signature is invalid!  I have checked
this once (through gpg on the command line) and the signature appeared to be
correct.

Steps to reproduce:

No error message (as has been ok with Evo 1.5.7).

Additional Information:
A) I have the additional condition Follow up is not marked for the
vFolder. Probably this has an influece on this.

File deskbar-applet-2.20.0/deskbar/deskbar-applet.py does not have a newline

This causes sed (at least on Solaris) to truncate the final line resulting
in the installed /usr/lib/deskbar-applet/deskbar-applet file being corrupted.

This appears to have been the case since this file was introduced in 2.19.6.

Steps to reproduce:
1. examine the source code eg
% tail -3 ./deskbar-applet-2.19.6/deskbar/deskbar-applet.py
            deskbar.defs.PACKAGE
            deskbar.defs.VERSION

Actual results:
On Solaris installed file is corrupted.  Trying to add deskbar applet to panel

"GSTREAMER-320113","[API] duration message changes","(1)
Rename GST_MESSAGE_DURATION => GST_MESSAGE_DURATION_CHANGED

GstMessage * gst_message_new_duration_changed (GstObject *src)


(3)
void  gst_message_parse_duration (GstMessage *message GstFormat *format gint64
*duration)

isn't required any longer.



 __tim duration queries can be quite expensive
 __tim I don't want to app to poll for it but get a notify when it
changed then let the app choose how many times it performs the expensive work
 so if it's expensive the element posts a DURATION message with duration
= -1 ?
 __tim actually the value in the message is not used
 __tim it's in the API but it's not usable in the end
 __tim the purpose of the message is to notify that the duration changed
and the exact new value can be retrieved with a query

"GNOME-PYTHON-90410","bonobo.ui.Container reference counting problem","I'm using this code to activate a control widget:

def _get_console_entry():

"GTKHTML-251212","Wrong font size","GTKHTML from CVS (for Evolution from HEAD) has suddenly decided to use the
wrong font size.

My GTK+ font is 7.7pt as 8pt is too large and 7pt is too small.  However
the gtkhtml widget in Evolution's composer has taken my font size and
converted it to an integer.  This results in fonts which are too small to read.

"GIMP-172581","gimpdata object filename problem if not representable in file name encoding","Run GIMP 2.2 with GLib 2.4 on Win32 in a locale that uses characters that aren't
representable in the system codepage (for instance run GIMP in Turkish on a
Western European (codepage 1252) Windows installation). When you quit it
crashes in gimp_data_create_filename() because g_filename_from_utf8() returns
NULL because the object names are localized and some of the localized names
contain characters not in codepage 1252.

Possible ways to fix this: Maybe gimpobject could also keep a non-localized name
for the object to be used for file names? That's probably a too big change for
the stable branch though. Maybe gimp_data_create_filename() should use some
fallback name (hex encoded UTF-8?) if g_filename_from_utf8() returns NULL?

This problem probably can occur also on Unix if you have a non-UTF-8 locale but
still run GIMP with a LANG setting that uses characters not present in the
filename encoding? Or would such a situation come under don't do that then?",0,"0"

"EVOLUTION-216947","Crash: Trouble Setting up a new mail account","Package: Evolution
Priority: Normal
Version: 1.0
Synopsis: Trouble Setting up a new mail account
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
Start Evolution with no mail accounts specified and it runs through the
add mail account wizard. At the end of the wizard it crashed. 
I have been having trouble with evolution recently possibly because my
/var partition became full.  
Evolution kept getting 'stuck' resynchronising with my mail servers
*IMAP) however there was no network utilisation from evolution and it
would not close down properly. 
I tried removing the mail accounts and then reentering them to clear the
problem and this worked once. On the second attempt the wizard crashed.
I have cleared out my /var partition and this problem is still arising. 
I haven't seen it with the previous version of evolution
(0.99.2-ximian).

"EVOLUTION-345331","evolution cvs head always crashes when i start it","compiled evo from cvs a few minutes ago.
evo *always* crashes when i start it no matter which component.
i'm only attaching thread 1 where this happens.

seems like this happened while fixing bug #252814 and/or bug #262210 see http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/evolution/widgets/misc/e-combo-button.c - 
after downloading revision 1.22 of that file and recompiling evolution works (okay the new icon and stuff like that is missing but at least it's a workaround for me).

"SAWFISH-45758","Session handling is broken except in `auto save on logout' mode","Timo Korvola looked into this a while back. Here are some excerpts of his
messages:

I wrote:
> So yes gnome-session indeed seems to be the culprit.

I looked into this some more.  What a mess!

It indeed seems that when the panel is used to log out it always tells
the session manager to save everything (SM save type both) without
offering the user any choice in the matter.  Instead gnome-session
pops up the confirmation dialog with the Save current setup
checkbox.  But regardless of the state of that checkbox gnome-session
proceeds to save the current session as requested by the panel.  The
catch is that gnome-session never _restores_ that particular saved
session if the Save current setup option was off.  To me this looks
weird and inefficient but not broken i.e. it should work with the
expected effects.  And it more and less seems to apart from some
trouble with Sawfish.

So it would again seem that the problem is in Sawfish.  My guess would
be that it is this:
                     Advice to Implementors

     If the client stores local any state in a file or simi-
     lar external storage it must create a distinct copy
     in response to each SaveYourself message.  It must not
     simply refer to a previous copy because the SM may
     discard that previous saved state using a DiscardCom-
     mand without knowing that it is needed for the new
     checkpoint.
[X Session Management Protocol X Consortium Standard]
In our case the SM does not discard the previous saved state but
instead relies on its availability for subsequent restarts.

By storing the file name in the restart command along with the session
id.  The restart and discard commands are updated whenever the session
is saved.  I actually implemented this for Sawfish but it isn't quite
working yet.

> Won't this lead to stale session files being left in the file
> system?

I think it is the resposibility of the session manager to clean up
using the discard commands which it saves in its session files.  So
whenever the SM is about to overwrite or delete a saved session it
should first execute all discard commands from that session.
Unfortunately Gnome-session tends to clean up the wrong files (the
current ones rather than the stale ones).  I'm still trying to figure
out what exactly is going on here.

> Maybe the above paragraph just means that the name of the session
> file should include the session id or some other unique token?

Unique for each checkpoint which the session id is not.  Using the
session id makes it impossible to copy sessions (no Save session
as... or anything like that).

This is a bit problematic: on my system (Red Hat 7.0) Xsm crashes immediately
whenever I press the session log or client list buttons.  Apparently
this has something to do with how it uses Athena text widgets but
I haven't been able to track it down exactly.  Anyway I removed some
text widgets from xsm and was able to test with it briefly.  It seems that
Xsm does not remove the stale session files at all.

So this is still rather poorly tested and works unreliably although
it would seem that the cause is the session manager.  With Xsm one can
view the client properties and they look all right to me.

are doing.
Description of Problem:
In evolution settings I add a new account and when the Evolution Account
Assistant comes up I also get a separate dialog window titled Security
Info with a Detail tab that has Digital signature and Encryption labels
(see screen shot). This was the 1st account defined in Evolution.

I don't know what security information there would be to display since I
have not done anything yet to define the new account. 

Also the OK button on the dialog does not work either.

Expected Results:
Not sure but if there is some security information required to be entered
for or associated with an account shouldn't it be part of the Account
Assistant.

>Description:
Left machine to run over night I had nothing open and when I got home
from work the unit was not allowing me to enter the terminal window so I
tried to logout and back in and it logged out but stayed at a grayish
background prior to the login screen and only the mouse was available. 
I hit ctrl/alt/F2 and forced the machine to reboot.  Got an error when I
logged into GNOME and found a icon in the filemanager at startup with a
canonball so I right mouse clicked it and it ran me through this bug
report.

"LIBGTOP-337235","fsusage.c broken in NetBSD (no statfs)","The statfs(2) function was removed from NetBSD sometime between 2.0 and 3.0.  That system call was replaced by statvfs(2) and the former was removed to force old code to migrate to the new system call.

Unfortunately sysdeps/freebsd/fsusage.c does not build because it uses statfs unconditionally.  The code should be modified to use statvfs if available and favour this API over the legacy one.

The attached patch does this it is quite simple because the configure thing already does the appropriate checks.",60,"0"

"DOXYGEN-473402","Relative references in diagrams no longer work","In Doxygen 1.5.2 I was able to create links to members in dot and mscgen diagrams using \ref MemberName. I am no longer able to do so with curreny Doxygen CVS.

The problem is demonstrated by the example code for the \msc command:

    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html#cmdmsc

The diagram in the documentation for the Sender class refers to its Ack() method and similarly the diagram in the documentation for the Receiver class refers to its Command() method but Doxygen reports:

:23: Warning: unable to resolve reference to `Command()' for \ref command
:8: Warning: unable to resolve reference to `Ack()' for \ref command

The generated HTML links are to the enclosing class not to the referenced method.

The same example works fine in Doxygen 1.5.2.

"PANGO-74880","Build Broken: undefined references during build","I have just completed a complete rebuild of my system as laid out at the 
linux from scratch web site: http://lfs.planetmirror.com/lfs/intro.shtml 
(one of the best sites for its kind on the web).  I tweaked my install 
slightly by obtaining newer versions of some of the packages (I'll tag the 
complete list to the end).  Pongo crashes during the build process.  Since 
I'm using all GNU software from scratch (I compiled it all myself using 
glibc2.2.5 and gcc3.0.4) this is likely to be a bug in Pongo.

You Aint gonna get more gnu then that...

the build.

Reproduce:

1.  install packages as shown in appendix (this includes all of the 
required libs as shown on the http://www.gtk.org pages)

"EVOLUTION-214374","Kerberos configuration uses LDFLAGS should use LIBS","I wanted to build Evolution against static MIT krb5 libraries (with krb4 support).  The configure.in code to look for Kerberos stuff puts -l flags in the LDFLAGS environment variable instead of the LIBS environment variable.  For dynamic libs this doesn't matter much but for static libs it causes a problem--since LDFLAGS precedes the object files being linked no symbols are pulled in from the krb5 or krb4 libraries and the link fails.

Here is a sample patch to fix the problem.  Unfortunately I don't know how well it will get through your bug reporting page.

Description:
Description of Problem:
Gnumeric crashes when I try to change the data source in an existing
graph -- I've got 2 tables with 200x200 cells on  different pages. I
want to put both results in the same picture. Hitting the ok-Button
causes a crash. But only sometimes!

It may crash in the same dialog if I try to change the linestyle too.
In that case there even is no crash dialog.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. right click on graph -> preferences -> graph line -> data 
2. mark data from different sheet
3. ok -> crash

Actual Results:
crash

Expected Results:


How often does this happen?
sometimes

"TRACKER-528339","string_replace function in tracker-configuration.c is broken","Please describe the problem:
The string_replace function in tracker-configuration.c doesn't work.  start_pos is not initialized to the beginning of the string and the end_pos and start_pos variables are swapped in the append function.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add several newlines to end of tracker.cfg
2. Run tracker-preferences

Actual results:
segfault in string_replace

Expected results:
Any occurrence of needle in haystack should be replaced with replacement

Does this happen every time?
Yes

"GNOME-SCREENSAVER-363436","don't poll stuff","So this has been discussed in various places - giving it a home.

We need to detect activity so that we may reset the idle timers and any idle related state.  For example we need to be able to nearly immediately cancel the idle warning fade out the power management idle state and the session idle state.  This is a bit different from the classical model of screensaver where something happens after a certain time and nothing happens before.  In that model a single event-pair on idle and not-idle from the window server is sufficient.  In our model we need events on activity (not idleness).

Activity is defined rather broadly.  In our case it includes not only window server input device activity but things like power-cord and laptop lid events etc.  The power related input is obtained from HAL events via g-p-m.

Most of window system input is obtained from events.  We select for these events on every window in the window tree.  However we have not selected for motion events.  This was an historical decision that predates g-s.  I suspect that this was to avoid performance issues from selecting for and recieving a flood of motion events.  Not sure.  So the pointer position was polled for.

Maybe we can use hints to not get flooded:

.logged in as normal user.

It appears that if GOK displays a UI Grab menu with a large number of
buttons when it reverts back to main the window has got smaller. If you
return to the same largely populated UI Grab menu and revert again the
main menu is smaller still.  
e.g.
- run StarOffice
- run GOK
- launch a new text document
- hit UI Grab and a large number of widgtes are available
- click back to go to main menu and it has shrunk smaller even as far as
making the buttons illegible.",42,"0"

"EVINCE-301996","Compile failure","Please describe the problem:
Compiling with --enable-t1lib breaks the compile. evince is trying to link
against -lt1lib and on my gentoo there is only -lt1 and -lt1x. If I change the
compile command manually it works.

how do I fix the configure script to generate a correct makefile?

I submitted the bug here also :

http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78956#c47

Steps to reproduce:
1. ./configure with --enable-t1lib
2. make
3. compile fails


Actual results:
ld fails to find -lt1lib

Expected results:
it should use -lt1 on systems that don't have -lt1lib

Does this happen every time?
yes

"GIMP-674543","Heal tool reads garbage values from solution matrix","Created attachment 212523
Patch.

In the heal tool the black checkers of the left hand edge of the solution matrix aren't currently being assigned a value.

Attached is a (trivial) patch that solves the issue.

It might explain the corruption described here (although I was never really able to reproduce the issue): https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2012-April/msg00122.html

Also it seems that this fixes the corruption in the proposed patch for bug 568098. (That patch is attachment 184900).",3,"0"

"BUGZILLA.GNOME.ORG-433527","[a11y] Improper use of  with combo boxes","If you look at the form fields that follow the attachment section you'll see a series of combo boxes that take the form:



...



As a result of this markup the label associated with the combo box is not the functional label (e.g. OS) instead it's the entire contents of the combo box (e.g. All AIX BSDI Cygwin GNU Hurd HP-UX IRIX Linux FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD opensolaris OSF/1 Solaris BeOS Macintosh Neutrino OS/2 Windows OpenVMS other).

When providing access to form fields on web pages screen reading software automatically speaks and displays in braille the label of the form field with focus to let the user know what information is expected there.   Because of the current markup in bugzilla the functional label isn't spoken and the entire contents of the combo box are.  This is making it difficult for one of the Orca developers to access the information in these fields. 

The solution to this problem would be to move the  so that the functional label is surrounded instead.

the 'PGP Preferences' in GNOME 2.4 and Seahorse-0.7.3 has no icon. All

"GTK+-344850","Dragging a GtkTreeViewColumn segfaults when using certain GtkTreeViewColumnDropFunc","Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a script that has a treeview and some columns
2. Create your own GtkTreeViewColumnDropFunc that always returns false for one certain column
3. If the column is the last one and you try to drag it your program will segfault.

It does not segfault when the column is not at the last place.

Stack trace:
Sorry I don't have debugging enabled in Gtk but maybe it helps:

In Evolution->Tools->Mail

possible to set up an ccount if it doesn't have at
least one dot. So it has to be AT LEAST like

user@domain DOT something.

This it's at least an improper way to enforce a
valid email address. My offce has an intranet that
since it has it's own DNS it's called santander
so at least inside my network:

user@santander

it's a valid address.

Other MUA's (like Kmail yotu major competitor :-)
doesn't mind about the format of the address of
the user I think that would be better.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1.- Try to setup an account without any dots in it.

"GTK+-314348","gtk_init ()  deletes command line arguments consisting of  - or --","Please describe the problem:
If the commandline arguments contain a standalone - or -- these arguments are
deleted by a call to gtk_init(&argc&argv). The value of argc is decremented.
This problem occurrs in 2.6.7 but not with 2.2x or 2.4x


Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the test program below and include a - in the command argument list
2. test_arg 1 2 - 3 4
3. Note that the command line arguments are different before and after the call :(

/*  
   gcc -O0 -g -Wall test_arg.c `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs` -lm -o

  for(i=0 i < argc i++)printf(arg number: %2d  value: %s\niargv[i])

  gtk_init(
  printf(\nafter gtk_init argc:  %d\nargc)
  for(i=0 i < argc i++)printf(arg number: %2d  value: %s\niargv[i])
  exit(0)
}

With GTK+-2.2 GTK+2.4.9:

$ test_arg 1 - 3   

before gtk_init argc: 4
arg number:  0  value: ./test_arg
arg number:  1  value: 1
arg number:  2  value: -
arg number:  3  value: 3

after gtk_init argc:  4
arg number:  0  value: ./test_arg
arg number:  1  value: 1
arg number:  2  value: -
arg number:  3  value: 3

With GTK 2.6.7 on Fedora Core 4
$ test_arg 1 - 3   

before gtk_init argc: 4
arg number:  0  value: ./test_arg
arg number:  1  value: 1
arg number:  2  value: -
arg number:  3  value: 3

after gtk_init argc:  3
arg number:  0  value: ./test_arg
arg number:  1  value: 1
arg number:  2  value: 3

NOTE that the - is GONE and has been deleted by gtk_init().





Actual results:
The test program prints outthe command line argument count and values both
before and after a call to gtk_init.  I rely on argc and argv not being changed
by a call
to gtk_init().

Expected results:
The command line argument count and values should not change in a call to
gtk_init(). Specifically if  - is an command line argument it should NOT be
deleted.

Does this happen every time?
yes  gtk 2x version dependent

Other information:
I can move the call to gtk_init later in the program to avoid the problem but
it means many changes in my code",0,"0"

Distribution: Fedora Core release 1 (Yarrow)
Package: Evolution
Priority: Major
Version: GNOME2.4.0 unspecified
Gnome-Distributor: GNOME.Org
Synopsis: evolution-alarm-notify dies when updating current appointments
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Calendar
Bugzilla-Version: unspecified
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.4.0.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:

When updating an appointment so that it becomes current (the present
time falls into its time range evolution-alarm-notify crashes.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. double-click a non-current appointment
2. change the time or date to make it current
3. e-a-n crashes dumping into bug buddy

Expected Results:

e-a-n should not crash.  If it crashes it should restart!  Otherwise
crashes that happen for other reasons when the user is away from the
desktop leave the user without alarm service until after evolution is
restarted.  I have missed meetings as a result of this.

How often does this happen?

Every time so far.

Additional Information:

evolution 1.4.5-7 which is not an option in bug buddy.

Also bug buddy needs some help.  First since it's called when an
application crashes it knows what the crashed ap was and can fill in
package and version itself.  Second you have meta-B bound to back
when most linux users use meta-B for backward-skip-word as in emacs.
On the bug entry page when you meta-B and then meta-F you get the
summary preserved but you lose all the description info you entered.
Since typing this very standard key combination is reflexive for me
(and *many* other linux users) while editing text I lost my entire
bug description twice before getting it right.  You should not have
meta-B bound to back but if you insist on it you should at least
save all the info in the type-in boxes so that users don't lose work
by typing this very standard key combination.

With an optical mouse on an uneven surface it is sometimes difficult to click an icon to throttle gnome-screensaver without immidiately stoping screensaver again. Disabling screensaver is very annoying if sleeping or doing non-computer work near a desktop computer.

"DOXYGEN-333053","typedef MemberDefs created too late for using decls","Please describe the problem:
doxygen-1.4.6 (and current CVS head) fail to correctly resolve methods utilizing
types pulled in with a using declaration when the type being used is itself a
typedef rather than a class type.

The problem is that while class (i.e. the ClassDef entries) are created very
early in the main processing sequence the other major class of user defined
types typedefs do not have definitions (i.e. MemberDef entries) until after
all the using declarations have been processed (and also after all template
specializations/instantiations have been handled).

The fact that typedefs are handled so late causes the handling of using
declarations involving typedefs to generate bogus ClassDef entries for the
type specified in the using declaration preventing other methods such as
getResolvedClass() and resolveTypeDef() from determining the true class of a
reference to the type of the using declaration.

namespace a
{
   /// class A doc.
   class A {}
}

namespace b
{
   /// typedef B doc.
   typedef a::A B
}

namespace c
{
   /// class C doc.
   class C
   {
      public:
      
      /// method doc.
      void fun1(const b::B
   }

}

using b::B

namespace c
{
   /** detailed doc */
   void C::fun1(const B& arg) {}
}   


Steps to reproduce:
1. run doxygen against this source:

namespace a
{
   /// class A doc.
   class A {}
}

namespace b
{
   /// typedef B doc.
   typedef a::A B
}

namespace c
{
   /// class C doc.
   class C
   {
      public:
      
      /// method doc.
      void fun1(const b::B
   }

}

using b::B

namespace c
{
   /** detailed doc */
   void C::fun1(const B& arg) {}
}   


Actual results:
The following error output is generated:

/home/scp/bug.cpp:31: Warning: no matching class member found for
  void c::C::fun1(const B &arg)
Possible candidates:
  void c::C::fun1(const b::B &arg)


Expected results:
It should not fail to resolve the fun1 definition.

Does this happen every time?
yes.

Other information:
My first instinct was to accept that findUsingDeclarations() would not have the
correct typedef definitions available. I implemented a new UsingDef class to
replace the use of a bogus ClassDef per the original code. The main point of
UsingDef what that whenever it was encountered when trying to resolve a type it
would perform the getResolvedClass() call. By implemented such a lazy
mechanism for binding to the type (class or typedef) definition the above code
could be properly handled by doxygen.

After implement this I began to suspect it would be more straightforward to
simply generate the typedef MemberDefs earlier. I simply duplicated the
buildVarList() function to a new buildTypedefList() function stripped it down a
little so it only processes typedefs and call it earlier in the sequence from
parseInput(). This technique also has the advantage of ensuring that all
template specializations and instances will resolve to the correct class type
via an arbitrary number of using decls.

"GTK+-451345","gtk-demo does not open GtkBuilder example twice","Hello

When I run gtk-demo and open Builder example all is ok but after I close Builder's example window I cannot open it again. gtk-demo dumps errors to terminal (see below)

I couldn't find anything obvious in the sources every other example is handled the same way and it's all OK with them. Maybe it is some GtkBuilder related problem?

BTW: Is it ok that there is no (in the gtk-demo/builder.c) free/destroy/unref to free created GtkBuilder? If so maybe it should be mentioned in gtk_builder_new documentation.

To reproduce:
1. run gtk-demo
2. double click on Builder (example window opens)
3. close the window
4. double click on Builder (and now it does not open)

Hi!

While testing gyrus (which is really a nice utility)
I found a bug in function gyrus_admin_login() in file
gyrus-admin.c

The problem occurs if a user tries to login to the
IMAP server using a password which contains white
space characters like ASCII 0x20 which is perfectly
valid according to RFC1730 and RFC3501

Such a password has to be a literal string or quoted string
though and the quotes are missing in the gyrus sources as
of version 0.3.6

I'm attaching a patch which solves the problem by providing
double quote characters around the password (tested with
gyrus 0.3.6)

Please note: with the patch it is still not possible to
send passwords containing double quote characters. It
might be better to use literal strings as defined in
RFC1730 though this might make handling of the login
command a little bit complicated as the client has to
wait for the server command continuation request after
sending the initial {nnn}CRLF sequence.

Note also that the same is true for the userid field
of the login command.

HTH

"NAUTILUS-417193","Selecting the current location triggers folder update","Please describe the problem:
This ``bug'' happens when selecting a bookmark that points to the current Nautilus location. If your current location is x and you activate a bookmark that points to x the content of the main window gets repainted.

I don't know if this is an intended behaviour (there's a Reload button in the toolbar and CTRL+R F5 work as well) anyway I find it mostly annoying especially since repeatedly clicking the same bookmark bring CPU usage to 100%.

On a side note the GtkFileChooser behaves just like Nautilus...

Does this happen every time?

"METACITY-491090","Initially iconified windows regression","The support in metacity for mapping a window initially iconified/minimized
is not working properly.

I'll attach a short test case program that demonstrates this.

The obvious problem is:

  /* See bug 334899 the window may have minimized ancestors
   * which need to be shown.
   *
   * However we shouldn't unminimize windows here when opening
   * a new display because that breaks passing _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN
   * between window managers when replacing them see bug 358042.
   */
  if (!display->display_opening)
    unminimize_window_and_all_transient_parents (window)

Which gets called even if earlier in the same function we did:

  if (window->initially_iconic)
    {
      /* WM_HINTS said minimized */
      window->minimized = TRUE
      meta_verbose (Window %s asked to start out minimized\n window->desc)
    }

I think that the right fix is:

-  if (!display->display_opening)
+  if (!display->display_opening && !window->minimized)
    unminimize_window_and_all_transient_parents (window)

The display->display_opening check is still needed because it applies to the
case where the window isn't minimized but some parent is ... we still want
to preserve that previous state. (probably ... it's a little pathological)

unminimize_window_and_all_transient_parents is used elsewhere so it 
doesn't need to be changed to unminimize_all_transient_parents.",152,"0"

If _gtk_print_operation_platform_backend_launch_preview (in gtkprintoperation-unix.c) fails to launch the previewer it will leave the
temporary file around.  It should not.

Also it should not use gtk_settings_get_default because that is not
multihead safe.  It should use gtk_settings_get_for_screen which should
be easy considering that it is finding the right screen anyway.

Why is the error dialog modal btw.?  Is that failure really important
enough to grab focus away from whatever the user is doing at the time?",37,"0"

Why is ne_end_request commented ? 

Because ne_read_response_block closes the underlying socket when calling the
abord method during an error. Calling ne_end_request expects an open socket and
segfaults again.

This is very bad as the ret value is used just after but It is just a hack to
avoid segfaults. Probably a neon expert will find a right way to do handle this
situation.",17,"0"

Steps to reproduce:

If I add from the ER-sheet a weak entity I get a normal entity. The only way to get a weak is to set the weak attribute manual over the properties menu.

Actual results:
A normal entity box appears.

Expected results:
A weak entity box appears.

"LIBRSVG-332798","rsvg wrapper script doesn't escape shell metacharacters","In librsvg 2.14 the 'rsvg' converter program has been replaced with a Python script wrapping the new rsvg-convert program. The wrapper script builds a command line for the new program and executes it but does not make any attempt to escape shell metacharacters.

As a result operations on paths with spaces parentheses apostrophes etc will fail:

$ /opt/rsvg2.14.0/bin/rsvg 'US_99W_(CA).svg' 'US_99W_(CA).svg.png'
sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
sh: -c: line 0: `/opt/rsvg2.14.0/bin/rsvg-convert  -o US_99W_(CA).svg.png US_99W_(CA).svg'

I'm marking this bug as critical because scripted use (such as the server-side rasterization we do at Wikipedia or a shell-out from a desktop program) is potentially open to very serious security problems (shell injection) when used without a fix.

The script itself is marked as deprecated but as it's compatible with the previous interface other people might be using it still too.

I'm attaching a patch which adds escaping to the parameters.",0,"0"

Opening a PDF document of a scanned textbook page. 
Scrolling through the document is fine but trying to left-click and drag (like trying to select text) would lead to the program crashing.

"GNOME-APPLETS-140358","VT switch (from X to console) *DOES NOT WORK* using NON-GNOME-DEFAULT keyboards in Keyboard Switcher Applet","STEPS TO REPRODUCE BUG 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
1) Launch Gnome desktop V2.0.X or V2.2.X or V2.4.X (under XFree 4.X). 
2) If Gnome Panel is not running already start Gnome Panel. 
3) Place Gnome Keyboard Switcher applet on Gnome Panel (if it isn't already there). 
4) In Gnome Keyboard Switcher applet's properties add new keyboard type (in my 
case this was a French Canadian but any keyboard type different than the default 
GNOME DEFAULT KEYBOARD *SHOULD* cause the issue). 
5) Use Gnome Keyboard Switcher applet to switch to a new keyboard type (ex: 
French Canadian) by clicking on Gnome Keyboard Switcher using mouse. 
6) Attempt to VT switch from X to console (by pressing any ALT-CTRL-Fn key i.e. 
ALT-CTRL-F2). 
 
 
RESULTS 
--------------------------------------------- 
VT switch *DOES NOT* happen as expected and user stays in X. 
 
 
WORKAROUNDS 
--------------------------------------------- 
Select GNOME DEFAULT KEYBOARD type using the Gnome Keyboard Switcher 
applet and VT switching (from X to console) becomes possible again using 
ALT-CTRL-Fn keys. 
 
MORE INFOS / OBSERVATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- 
- XFree 4.X option DontVTSwitch is DISABLED AT *ALL* times in XFree86Config 
file. 
- Using a console prompt within X I have noticed using the xev program that X 
keyboard events triggered while attempting to do a VT switch using the GNOME 
DEFAULT KEYBOARD are *DIFFERENT* than the SUPPOSEDLY SAME keyboards 
events triggered while attempting to do a VT switch using any NON-GNOME 
DEFAULT KEYBOARD (there seems to be an offset of 10 in the detected Fn keys 
while NON-GNOME-DEFAULT keyboards are active in the Gnome Keyboard 
Switcher applet). 
- Using a console prompt within X again I have also noticed that it *IS* possible to 
VT switch from X to console even if a NON-GNOME DEFAULT KEYBOARD is 
currently selected in the Gnome Keyboard Switcher applet -- I just bypass the 
Gnome Keyboard Switcher applet and I use the /usr/bin/chvt X program [as 
ROOT] directly (where X is a number equivalent to the Fn key I would press to get 
to a specific console) -- not very practical and safe though. 
- This bug *DOES NOT* occur with the older Gnome 1.4 desktop's Keyboard 
Switcher applet. 
- This bug has been observed in Gnome 2.0.X 2.2.X 2.4.X. 
- This bug has *NOT* been tested in Gnome 2.6.X.

Patch: report window sticky state correctly

Problem has been reported in various places:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567607
https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6192
http://redmine.audacious-media-player.org/issues/16

GTK's window-state-event reports completely bogus values for GDK_WINDOW_STATE_STICKY.  Installed version of GTK/GDK is 3.2.3 but the problem has been there for years probably since the code was first written.  There are actually two problems:

Problem #1: In gdk_check_wm_desktop_changed() in gdkdisplay-x11.c XGetWindowProperty() returns the 32-bit value (a CARDINAL) of _NET_WM_DESKTOP in a 64-bit signed long.  The problem lies in the fact that the X11 API leaves undefined the value of the high 32 bits in the long.  If you look at the X11 source (_doXRead32() in XlibInt.c) the actual behavior alternates between extending the sign bit of the 32-bit word through the high bits of the 64-bit word and setting the high bits all to zero.  Hence the only correct option for GDK is to ignore the high 32 bits of the 64-bit word completely.  Instead GDK first casts the signed 64-bit long to an unsigned 64-bit gulong (which is odd but not a problem) and then compares that gulong to the value 0xFFFFFFFF (which is wrong).  On my system the result is that toplevel->on_all_desktops is always set to FALSE.  My patch masks off the high 32 bits of the gulong before the comparison.

Problem #2: In do_net_wm_state_changes() in gdkdisplay-x11.c the logic used to decide whether to set or clear the GDK_WINDOW_STATE_STICKY flag is inconsistent.  The flag is set when either toplevel->have_sticky or toplevel->on_all_desktops are TRUE and cleared when either of the same are FALSE.  This means that when toplevel->have_sticky is TRUE but toplevel->on_all_desktops is FALSE (due to problem #1) GDK repeatedly flips GDK_WINDOW_STATE_STICKY back and forth.  My patch changes the behavior to only set GDK_WINDOW_STATE_STICKY when both toplevel->have_sticky and toplevel->on_all_desktops are TRUE.",3,"0"

Actual Results:
It is not possible to remove the emblem.

Expected Results:
It should be possible to remove user defined
emblems. I tried using a context menu (there is
none) and dragging the user defined emblem to the

"EVOLUTION-210289","Crash: Evolution cashes on startup -- still points at evil email","Package: Evolution
Priority: Normal
Version: 0.13.99
Synopsis: Evolution cashes on startup -- still points at evil email
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
This evil email with the attachment crashes Evolution every time it
starts -- I have no way to delete this message and evolution is still
pointing at it so it crashes everytime. If I can get at the email
message a different way would you like it?

for the discrimination. The fonts don't share an unique attribute that no other
fonts have. The fonts are from different directories. All fonts work in gtk
athena or any other X program.

XFree86 version 4.0.3 using xfsd to deliver all fonts to X. 

Adding the fonts to ~/.nautilus/fonts works.

I need more info.  What linux distribution ?

How is X installed ?  RPMS ?  Which version ?  Are you using a font server ?  Or
is the font specified in /etc/X11/XF86Config ?




------- Additional Comments From drc@gnome.org 2001-04-16 22:42:55 ----

X is compiled from source(not srpm). Using font server as stated before.

Can you please attach your font server config file ?  Thanks.

Also where is that config file found.  Is it in /etc/X11/fs/config ?  Or
somewhere else ?  Thanks.

The file is located in /etc/xfs.conf and run with
/usr/X11R6/bin/xfs -config /etc/xfs.conf &



------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-04-20 07:16:56 ----

I have a fix for this but im curious.  Whats the deal with the /etc/xfs.conf
file ? Is that the default place for a plain build of XFree86 and the font
server ?

Cause on RedHat boxes it is /etc/X11/fs/config.  Is /etc/xfs.conf something you
picked ?  Is there some place where I can find out what all the possibilities
for the location of this file are ?

Or is the answer that any user can put it anywhere they want ?




------- Additional Comments From ramiro@fateware.com 2001-04-20 07:22:45 ----

I checked in a fix for this using the xfs.conf path you reported.

If other linuces (or even other systems) put this file in different places then
we'll have to teach nautilus about them which is kinda lame but the price of
freedom i guess.



------- Additional Comments From drc@gnome.org 2001-04-20 12:24:55 ----

I just picked it. You can just change it with the -config parameter. So you need
to define the font path again when using freetype? Seems to be the case with
gimp-freetype plugin too. Perhaps there should be a freetype specific font dir
list somewhere. Gimp-freetype asks for directories when first run. But the
again getting a general font list for freetype is freetypes issue.

"NAUTILUS-128139","Nautilus won't Move to Trash in some cases","From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.5) Gecko/20031031

Description of problem:
I'm attempting to delete a file using nautilus by right-clicking on
the file and selecting Move to Trash.  Nothing happens.  I've
verified the permissions and ownership of the file and everything is
fine.  I am able to delete the files in question via a bash shell session.

I've noticed that I *can* delete files that reside in my home
directory using nautilus.  Note that my home directory is mounted over
nfs.  The files that nautilus refuses to delete always appear to be
files located on local file systems.

I assume my Trash is located in my home directory.  Does nautilus
have a bug in it where it can't delete files when the Trash lives on
different file system and/or on nfs?!?


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
nautilus-2.2.1-5

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
[See my description above.  I believe this only happens if your
Trash is located on a filesystem separate from the file(s) you are
attempting to delete or possibly it's isolated to the case where the
Trash lives on an nfs filesystem.]
    

Actual Results:  Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  File should have been moved to the Trash.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

"TOTEM-516236","searching in youtube use a huge quantity of CPU","This bug has been reported here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/190157

always reproducible these are the steps:
1) install python-gdata
2) enable youtube plugin
3) try to search for something.
4) you will see your CPU goes to 50% until results are fetched!

moreover: if there are no results the CPU is used until you close totem (and you can't search for other things)

try to search for calopsitte kill bill which should return no results and cpu goes to 100%

totem version is: 2.21.92

"GLADE-145299","Internal children break GladeProjectView in tree mode","Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the Widget Tree

The problem is that the glade_gtk_dialog_post_create() function creates two
internal GladWidget (one for the action area and one for the vbox) and when
adding these widgets to the project the Widget Tree (GladeProjectView) tries to
add them to the model but as the parent widget (the dialog) is not yet in the
model they can not be added properly.

"GALEON-64546","Arguments to mail handler are quoted inconsistently","Galeon tries to be smart about quoting the substitutions in the command
string for an external mail handler but really it ends up being
incosistent and annoying.

For example a handler of:

   echo mail '(subject . %s) (to .  %t)' >& /tmp/mailto-args

and a mail tag of

   mailto:user@host

results in

   mail (subject . ) (to .  robin.gallagher@dsto.defence.gov.au)

Note the *4* quotes in place of the null %s substitution. The reason I want
to do this is because I want the argument to be a lisp expression to send
to emacs.I need the quotes to always be there to indicate a lisp string and
never to have gratuitous extra quotes. I can get around this in various
ways all of them ugly.
I presume the motivation for extra quotes around null arguments is so one
can naively specify a handler

    mail -s %s

instead of

    mail -s %s

However I think this is misguided. The least surprise thing to do is
just do straight % interpolation and feed the line to the shell without any
extra second guessing.

An alternative would be to *always* add quotes around the interpolated
quantity. That seems less intutive but at least it is consistent. To only
add quotes when it is a null string leads to bizzare behaviour!",16,"0"

"GNOME-VFS-44685","Build (compile) process problem in/for GNOME-VFS ...","Since I have DEBIAN WOODY on my system I had to download
the source tarball. As per the instructions I built the tarballs
in order: oaf GConf then gnome-vfs. 

During gnome-vfs the ./configure process states that (output 
from /.configure): 

*** The gconf-config script installed by GCONF could not be found
*** If GCONF was installed in PREFIX make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path or set the GCONF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gconf-config.

I didn't see this message when I first tried to compile. 

This resulted later in a compilation error: 

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -DGNOME_VFS_CONFDIR=\/usr/local/lib/etc\
-DGNOME_VFS_DATADIR=\/usr/local/lib/share\ -I../intl -I.. -I../intl

gnome-vfs-mime-handlers.c:29: gconf/gconf.h: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [gnome-vfs-mime-handlers.lo] Error 1


By means of a find I discovered that the gconf-config binary was 
located at 

/usr/local/lib/bin/gconf-config

not in the expected place of 

/usr/local/bin/gconf-config

So either the ./configure process within gnome-vfs needs to be changed 
or the GConf make install needs to do a symbolic link or somesuch.

them out at my leisure  but many are GnomeVFS bugs we should look at for 2.0

"GNOME-SESSION-89988","unwriteable .ICEauthority disallows login without feedback","This may be a for gnome-session or a gdm or some gnome component.

If the .ICEauthority file is blocked by being owned by root (or probably if
it is set RO) attempting to log in will simply reset to gdm after a few
seconds.

Notably not all WM environments will crash when .ICEauthority is
unmodifiable.  I was able to log in with TWM or some other similar WM but
this may have been in the 'gnome-safe' setting. KDE is also unable to load
when this occurs but it gives an error message that helps you track down
the problem (i.e. something like Unable to modify .ICEauthority file).

In my opinion this bug can be resolved by detecting this error and
providing the user feedback about the problem.  There may be even more
clever ways around it so that never occurs but they may be challenging to
implement. Although I don't think there is no good reason for .ICEauthority
to be set RO or owned by root (i.e. this is only caused by another error)
 my .ICEauthority got that way for some reason I don't understand.  Gnome
should at least help me out here--I ended up reinstalling everything and
losing my configurations in an attempt to fix the login problem before I
stumbled upon .ICEauthority as the source of my woes.",1614,"1"

"GNOME-VFS-154753","If default workgroup isn't set in GConf use the value from smb.conf","The following patch makes the Network window display computers in the
workgroup listed in the smb.conf file instead of WORKGROUP if the workgroup
name hasn't been set in GConf.

The implementation is as discussed with Alex on IRC:
 1) modify the gnome-vfs SMB method to make smb://X-GNOME-DEFAULT-WORKGROUP/
    display the contents of the workgroup name listed in the SMBCCTX (which
    comes from the smb.conf config file).
 2) modify the gnome-vfs Network method to use X-GNOME-DEFAULT-WORKGROUP
    as the default workgroup name if none is listed in GConf instead of
    defaulting to WORKGROUP.

While this isn't a substitute for exposing the /system/smb/workgroup GConf key
somewhere in the preferences it does mean that if Samba has been set up on the
workstation Gnome will default to browsing that same workgroup.",0,"0"
"GDK-PIXBUF-350911","gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_scale() should skip when there's enough image data (was: Trashes memory when trying to thumbnail this file)","libgnomeui was patched to stop loading an image using the GdkPixbufLoader when there's enough data for displaying an image but GTK+ doesn't seem to do this. A patch like attachment 70248 against gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_scale() could IMHO fix this.

[...]

static GStaticMutex (g__array_mem_chunk_lock) = { 0 { { 0} } }
[...]

I guess this problem is related to the following sentences of Section 5.13 
(Arrays of Length 0) of the Using and Porting the GNU Compiler 
Collection (GCC) guide available at http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-
3.0.3/gcc_5.html#SEC80 :

GCC versions before 3.0 allowed zero-length arrays to be statically 
initialized. In addition to those cases that were useful it also allowed 
initializations in situations that would corrupt later data. Non-empty 
initialization of zero-length arrays is now deprecated. 

Instead GCC allows static initialization of flexible array members. This 
is equivalent to defining a new structure containing the original 
structure followed by an array of sufficient size to contain the data. 
I.e. in the following f1 is constructed as if it were declared like f2.

"DESKBAR-APPLET-324578","Python-format string doesn't allow for re-ordering variables in translation","Hello :)

I am translating deskbar-applet for the first time into Vietnamese and I am impressed by the context that has been added. Thankyou for doing that because it gives us the information to create high-quality translations.

The only problem I have is with re-ordering variables in a translation. This is often necessary in order for the translation to make sense. In this string:
_____
po:37
auto:	⑤	translators: First %s is the search engine name second %s is the search term
reference:	⑤	../deskbar/handlers_browsers.py:67
flag:	②	python-format
Original:	⌘0	Search %s for %s
Việt:		Tìm kiếm %$2s trong %$1s
_____

I have to reorder the variables because in my language you say Search for Y in X instead of Search X for Y.

I have used the technique for reordering variables in C-format strings. This brought up an error when I checked the file against msgfmt so I queried it on the Translation Project mailing list where there is some truly impressive gettext expertise. Bruno Haible said:
_____
The python-format is documented in the GNU gettext doc as follows:

  Python format strings are described in Python Library reference /
  2. Built-in Types Exceptions and Functions / 2.2. Built-in Types /
  2.2.6. Sequence Types / 2.2.6.2. String Formatting Operations.
  `http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.1/lib/typesseq-strings.html'.

Now when you look at this URL you will find no traces of the
reordering with $ as in C. This means this syntax is not supported
in Python. But what is supported is named arguments:

   Search %(engine)s for %(term)s
   Tìm kiếm %(term)s trong %(engine)s

But you will have first to report a bug to the developers asking them
to use the string Search %(engine)s for %(term)s. (See the
Report-Msgid-Bugs-To address.)
_____

There was no address in that field but deskbar-applet was registered with Bugzilla hence this report.

Would it be a huge hassle to use named arguments instead of printf-style ones in your Python translation files? It would certainly mean higher-quality translations. I'll submit my file today so there is a translation but I'll improve this string as soon as I can reorder the variables.

Thankyou for your time. :)

is breaks gcc's C99 strict aliasing rules. To get around this you need to
convert a guchar** to a MotifTargetTableHeader*. The only way I can see that is
valid is to create a guchar** use this in parameter 12 of XGetWindowProperty
cast this to a temporary gpointer and then cast the temporary gpointer to an
XGetWindowProperty* variable. 

So the previous fragment will look like:

      MotifTargetTableHeader *header = NULL
      .
      .
      .
      guchar **pheader
      gpointer temp_header

Effort obviously went into making the dialogs to behave so as they used to

tendency to obscure their own progress bars (on image windows) or another
windows I'd like to use meanwhile so I have to deal with them to see the

exactly what should *not* happen in a good GUI and is against HIG IMHO.

"GNOME-VFS-109044","Cannot make external application the default for MIME type","(Sorry if this is the wrong component).

There seems to be a problem with the ability to set an external application
as the default for a MIME type -- or rather make GNOME/Nautilus use the
application set instead of a viewer.

Right click on a PNG file for example chose Open with>Other Application.
Now we want to use qiv as the handler for PNG files. The application is
obviously not listed in the list (the list has stuff like Eye of GNOME
ImageMagick Display The GIMP). In the list one can set an application to
be used as default. So we need to click Go There and set an application
manually.
In the Edit file type dialogue chose Viewer component: None and Default
action: Custom and then specify the path to the qiv binary. Click OK and
go back to Nautilus.

When one now clicks on the .png file Image View is opened if one has that
installed otherwise one gets Nautilus has no viewer that can display
 or similar.

The way to make it use the application by default is to have the line

default_action_type=application

in the entry for the MIME type in ~/.gnome/mime-info/user.keys .
However it seems that this isn't set for some reason. Maybe it is only set
it a handler is chosen from the list of registered applications in Open
with>Other Application.

The password that gets set with the users and groups utility (from the System

Result: unknown password! 
 
Don't try reproducing this with an account you need to login with again! 
 
You can change the password fine with the KDE utility or passwd.



Another comment:

Found the same thing.  I could specify a manual password which it would
supposedly accept but then obviously ignore.  I could select to autogenerate a
random password - again it ignores this.  If you add a user then restart the
users and groups tool and look at the password - it is always reset to manual
(irrespective of previous setting) and password always has eight characters
(again irrespective of what was there before) and no way of finding out what it
has been set to.

As has been noted workaround is to set password through root terminal or similar.

4.Logout from the session
Music continues to play

5.Login as a different user
Music continues to play

Expected behaviour:
Music should stop playing when user logs out.

There is rather easy to fi here

One only need to make sure cdrom_stop() is called when a 'destroy'
and 'delete_event' is handled.

Will attach a patch next.",2,"0"
"GLIB-156808","GOption doesn't handle conflicts between groups","If liba and libb both have a --debug option in their option groups using them
together will at best produce undefined behaviour from GOption. If we don't
handle such conflict we should warn if they occur. But I would prefer to handle
them somehow. Proposal: allow to specify a prefix when adding a group so that
in the scenario above the group from liba could get prefix a the other one
b and the goption would parse --a-debug and --b-debug. 

That doesn't resolve the conflict for short options but at least it makes all
options reachable via long options.",3,"0"

city in a neighboring state and has a popluation of a few thousand.

Why is there not just a file to edit to fix this? (I mean a runtime
configuration file)

>Description:
On closing while playing a CD (The very best of Cream - good stuff) it
reported a fatal error while closing. Maybe I should have stopped the CD
playing or unmounted it before closing it or something.

Oh well...


>How-To-Repeat:
1. Play cream CD loudly (sunshine of your love to be precise)
2. Decide you have to reboot in windoze for housemate
3. Close MahJongg (which you were playing because you have no life)
4. Press the X to close the CD player with profound failure.

Have you ever really listened to the lyrics for Sunshine Of Your Love?
Saucy stuff... gotta wonder how it got by the censors of the time!

At some point it suddenly started skipping back and forth rather than
continuing to scroll down. It seems highly dependent on the exact mouse
distance from the bottom of the gtkhtml window. If I move up or down it will
continue selecting normally again but if I find the right magic spot again
it switches back to skipping.

Other maybe relevant facts: the text I'm selecting is PRE-formatted and at
least one line is wider than the window.",799,"1"

Description of Problem:  The button on my PalmIIIc cradle is broken so I
use the onscreen HotSync button to initiate a hotsync.  When running in the
background the hotsync process never starts and my Palm winds up timing out.


Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Place PalmIIIC into cradle
2. Turn on palm and go into hotsync screen
3. Press the onscreen hotsync button (not the physical button on the cradle)

Actual Results:  Palm device times out and reports error establishing a
connection with my computer.


Expected Results:  Hotsync process should begin.

Additional Information:

To get the process to work:
1) Launch gtop system monitor.
2) Kill gpilotd
3) Open a terminal screen
4) Launch gpilotd DO NOT USE gpilotd &
5) Keep terminal screen open and initiate the HotSync process as described
above
6) Hooray!  HotSync is carried out successfully.

"INTLTOOL-128667","Reason for sporadic test case failures","I thought I was going mad for a moment -- sometimes all the tests would
pass. Sometimes a couple of them would fail.

The problem: there is no requirement that attributes in an XML element
remain in the same order (that is no requirement in the XML
specification). And it seems that XML::Parser exploits this fact and
*sometimes* changes the order of the attributes (my random guess is that
they are going in and out of a hash that is not deterministic). So we see
test differences like this...

On an XML level there is no difference here. It's just that the attributes
in the object element are around the other way.

Initially I thought the fix here here might be just to remove one attribute
from the object element in merge5u.sheet.in and merge5p.sheet.in (the two
places I have seen it happen). But now I am not so sure about why this
couldn't happen on any other the other merge?.xml.in files (many of them
have multiple attributes).

So I have no solution at the moment. Just thought I would file the bug so
this doesn't get overlooked in the long run. It's pretty minor though
(except that 'make distcheck' stands a small chance of failing).",32,"0"

"CHEESE-526214","Cheese should not use xgamma for flash effect - it unsets ICC calibration","Steps to reproduce:
Generate an ICC profile for your monitor via some means.
Run xcalib yourprofile.icc
Run Cheese
Take a picture

Expected results:
Flash!

Actual results:
Flash! Your display is now restored to its uncalibrated state!

The issue lies where Cheese uses xgamma to determine the current state of the monitor. When e.g. xcalib has been used to calibrate properly xgamma has no chance of representing the state correctly so it just returns 1.0 1.0 1.0.

It is worth pointing out that gamma curves are simple response functions rarely representative of a display's actual response.

alex@fizz:~$ xcalib lcd.icc 
alex@fizz:~$ xgamma
-> Red  1.000 Green  1.000 Blue  1.000

So we need to come up with another way of flashing the screen. Can we detect if a compositor is running create a full screen RGBA window and use window manager hints to modify its opacity?",51,"0"

I have GCC 2.95.3 GLIBC 2.2.4.

This is what configure says:

checking for jpeg_destroy_decompress in -ljpeg... yes
checking for jpeglib.h... no
configure: warning: *** JPEG loader will not be built (JPEG header file not
found) ***
In config.log I find this:
configure:9374: checking for jpeglib.h
configure:9384: cc -E  conftest.c >/dev/null 2>conftest.out
In file included from /usr/include/jpeglib.h:24
                 from configure:9380:

configure: failed program was:

This is mysterious. I often have had to pass --disable-more-warnings to
various programs although not since I upgraded GLIBC to 2.2.4. Never had
it happen through a configure script.

I also have compiled mainly applications that depend on jpeglib.",6,"0"

"EVOLUTION-209254","Composer misses Help button in menu","Package: Evolution
Priority: Wishlist
Version: 0.13.99
Synopsis: New Message dialog needs Help button in menu
Bugzilla-Product: Evolution
Bugzilla-Component: Mailer

Description:
I was tinkering with the possibilities of layout in the New Message
dialog. Instead of just playing with it I suddenly wanted to read about
my possibilities. Then I had to realise that there is no way of getting
help from within the New Message dialog.

My suggestion for a solution would be twofold:
1) Add the button right away. Just let it open the general evolution
mail help.
2) When there the helptext specific to the New Message dialog is
ready let the help button link to that (so that it's more context
sensitive).
