Lockup from new game

I tried Brütal Legend on Fedora 18/x86_64 the game itself if i386.
The system has these newer-than-Fedora18 components:
kernel 3.9+ (commit 51a26ae7a14b85c99c9be470c2d28eeeba0f26a3)
libdrm 2.4.44 from 2.4.44-2.fc20 SRPM from Koji recompiled on F18
llvm-3.3 from May 7 before branching to 3.3 was done
mesa 9.2 from May 7 commit was around 03ef60681e61a52dee7fa3285618c313cf13f50c
compiled into an RPM with float textures enabled:

$ rpm -q mesa-libGL
mesa-libGL-9.2-0.1.fc18.x86_64
mesa-libGL-9.2-0.1.fc18.i686

The game makes the Radeon chip lock up reliably at the same point
which is when the game starts after the long cutscene.

Attached are two dmesgs showing the same lockup.
The first occurred when I started a new game and watched through the cutscene.
The second occurred when I tried to continue the auto-saved game.",637,"1"
"XORG-1839","Fixes for loadable modules and strict aligned access in int10 module","While getting X working on my NetBSD/cats which is an ARM based platform I've

"XORG-671","Display corruption on exit","Using the VIA display driver with XOrg 6.7.0 it is impossible to cleanly exit
the X environment. After exiting using any graphical environment (GNOME Window
Maker plain X with an xterm etc) the X server terminates normally but instead
of returning to the normal console the display becomes severely corrupted: a
snowy unreadable display that requires a reboot to fix. The only way I can exit
X is to switch to a console VT while X is running and issue a kill $(pidof X).

This display corruption happens any time the X server dies while in control of
the display (whether it crashes abnormally or exits cleanly).

My chipset is VIA KM400 onboard video on an ASUS A7V8X-MX motherboard. I'm using
a VESA framebuffer console (1024x768x16bpp) with kernel 2.6.5 on a Gentoo system

"XORG-10645","XV plays only on external VGA","When playing a movie (either using MPlayer or Totem both through XV) the Intel driver seems to want to output only on one pipe. On my laptop LVDS is attached to pipe B while VGA is attached to pipe A.

When the XV overlay window is on the laptop screen only the overlay color (blue) is shown without output when it is on an attached VGA output XV output is shown there.

Similarly when the display is cloned only the external VGA output shows while the laptop display shows blue.

When there are no external VGA outputs connected (i.e. only the laptop LCD panel) playing movies via XV shows just the overlay color.

Hi

I was trying to build GIT master on Visual C++ under x86 mode (this does not affect building under x86-64/x64 mode as the MMX code cannot be built under x64 in Visual C++) and found that the build failed as I intended to build with both USE_X86_MMX and USE_SSE2 enabled.  It seems that there were some GCC-specific implementations of 

_mm_mulhi_pu16
_mm_shuffle_pi16

breaks PRIME sync i.e. Optimus hardware with nvidia binary driver PRIME output and Sync (nvidia-drm.modeset=1 kernel parameter) active.
Symptoms differ slightly depending on system.
e.g. running gdm/gnome after about 10 seconds the display gets frozen including mouse pointer and I can move around a second mouse pointer to move around but no screen updates occur any more. No error messages or warnings the xserver is running fine I can switch to text console and back or zap the xserver but no more screen updates.
Another user reported running lightdm it take 1 min to see a login but screen updates occur every 30sec.

This however has a nasty side effect as that laptops that are docked have normally their lid closed. 

I already reported this to Lennart and his indication is that this should be fixed in the kernel (setting event SD_DOCK) or by the desktop environment. 

Unfortunately systemd starts already suspending the laptop during the boot process long before I reach the login manager. This means that practically I can no longer boot my laptop while it is docked without opening the lid. As that I have an external monitor this is a bit of a ridiculous situation. 

I already raised a bug for the kernel but I do not expect a fast reply on that nor a fix.  Raising a bug for the desktop environment (as suggested by Lennart) would be strange as that NO desktop environment is running at that time. The only process that is in full control at that moment is systemd (system boot time).",7,"0"

I have hangs where I still can move the mouse pointer (but display is frozen). I have hangs where both mouse and display freeze (particularly after resuming from s2ram).

It seems that this happens more frequently when kms is enabled and less
without it (passing nomodeset=1 ).

The #include files in cairo-1.12.0/boilerplate/cairo-boilerplate-ps.c (eventually) include cairo-1.12.0/src/cairo-clip-private.h which causes the issue.

Xorg log with external monitor plugged in

Problem:
Left-most 10px of my laptop's screen are offset right 10px right-most 10px are displayed on the left of that screen. VGA-0 has no problems.

Steps to re-produce:
xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 640x480 # to eleminate my previous Virtual line as a source of the problem
xrandr --output VGA-0 --left-of LVDS-0
xrandr --output LVDS-0 --mode 1280x800

Expected result:
The laptop and the external monitor form one large desktop with all pixels in their correct spots!

Actual result:
See attached images

Work-around:
This problem persists even if the external monitor is removed and the computer re-booted. The only way to restore the correct display of LVDS-0 is to disable Randr1.2 in xorg.conf and re-boot (zapping X doesn't help in this case).

The dmesg output

I have a NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT graphics card. I'm using Gentoo on a AMD64 machine with a custom built 3.5 kernel.

I've been using nouveau for more than a year by now without any kind of problems. Yet since I enabled the last kernel options I needed to get 3D hardware acceleration I'm having some issues.

When closing applications like web browsers or video players the X server suddenly hangs (I cannot even move the pointer) and after a few seconds it crashes and I see a TTY console. Then I think gdm tries to restart it and after a few seconds I have again some graphics on the screen which often is a corrupted image of what I was seeing before the crash. Then X crashes again gdm tries to restart it and so on.

When I'm on the TTYs I'm having some keyboard issues (keys double-typed or missed) but otherwise they work fine so I was able to log in and get some dmesg output and X logs which I'm attaching.

This issue only appears after I suspend and resume the PC. I can trigger this behavior almost at will after a resume but I'm not able to do it before. It also seems to be related to Xorg drivers and/or 3D since I didn't encounter it before activating hardware acceleration and it only affects the X server even after a restart while having no effect at all on TTYs.

./configure should check $host for being solaris and either write the check

dmesg after the crash

Hello

I haven't tried using radv/Vulkan in a few months but last time I tried most of the apps/games worked and only a few crashed the system now it seems all do have issues.

I am using a 280x on agd5f's linux-staging 4.11 (but the system freezes as well on standard 4.11.3). Xorg is 1.19.3.

Once the computer hangs I'm unable to use it directly but I can still connect from another machine through SSH. I do have to manually force a restart though.

Games I've tried which froze the system:
- Mad Max (it always was bad for me).
- Serious Sam Fusion (that one used to work as long as no steam overlay).

Apps I've tried with similar results:
- Some projects from SaschaWillems/Vulkan (some used to run others would just refuse to but no crash in the past).
- The Dolphin emulator (which used to work as well).

I am on mesa-git llvm-svn and ddx-git as well.
I'm happy to test patches as needed.

Thanks!",64,"1"

I have to use xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1024x768(or other mode name) to unblank it.

I believe this issue is caused by function RADEONInitCRTC2Registers.when issue randr to change DVI-1 mode RADEONInitCRTC2Registers will be callded to define the CRTC2 registers for requested video mode RADEON_CRTC2_CRT2_ON bit of register RADEON_CRTC2_GEN_CNTL was cleared in this function. 
To solve the problem I suggest checking RADEON_CRTC2_CRT2_ON bit and keeping the status as it is.

Problem Description:
In LO we are using for the main titles and headlines of the dialogs the title case (capitalise significant/longer words) instead of the sentence case (capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences: e.g. first word starting with capital letter and then going on with small letters).
I personally also would prefer that title case for the menus and dialogs of LO but only for the main titles and headlines.

Note: You can see the title case writing for instance if you take a look at menus in the menu VIEW.

But I found there some dialogs where there are items not in this title case systematics if we want to follow that (see list below).

Does anybody has any objections comments or corrections to my comment?

"DRI-23357","[GL40]  [i686]  KMS black screen with kernel 2.6.30","On HP Montenvia based prototype laptop KMS shows black screen. 

System environment:
-- chipset:  GL40
-- system architecture: i686
-- xf86-video-intel:  2.7.0
-- xserver: 1.5.1
-- mesa:
-- libdrm:  2.4.12
-- kernel:  2.6.30
-- Linux distribution:  Red Flag 6.1
-- Machine or mobo model:  N/A prototype system
-- Display connector: LVDS

Kernel config:

         CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE = y

Reproducing steps:
       
       

1. If system boots with VGA=788 both VT & X gives a black screen. Note that although screen is black system is active. I can blindly switch between VT and X or among VTs.  So I blindly switch to a VT log in and then cat /proc/fb  to a file  it gets:

 0 VESA VGA
 1 inteldrmfb


2. Without VGA=788 after booting up VT can display cat /proc/fb gets:

    0 inteldrmfb

In this case the screen turns into black on both VT and X once starting X.



3. I tried to attach an extra VGA monitor to the laptop and black screen as well.

4. Disable X starting in init_level 5 with VGA=788 after booting up Screen is black. Try to adjust backlight via sys interface doesn't work.  Now if ssh to
the system and then startx we can get the stack:

One monitor I'm working with (LG E2340T-PN) used to work with oneiric on full HD just fine. no problems at all!
After the (clean) installation of precise I suddenly have to use the 1680x1050 resolution. switching to 1080p just thrashes X.

The monitor I use at home is a Dell 20 (1680x1050 native). I have to switch to 1280x1024 to make my monitor work. If I don't my screen flickers and jitters and tries to sync (constantly).

The projector I use at home is a SONY VPL-CX76 (1400x1050). no problems with it at all! a Dell projector at work simply doesn't work at all (getting no signal). We have a couple high end sony projectors as well (1080p monsters) that give me the same jittering as on my monitor at home.

"LIBREOFFICE-86203","Empty spaces in special characters dialog selection grid (no filtering of unavailable characters)","Created attachment 109344
Screenshot of empty spaces in the special characters dialog

The Special Characters dialog contains a grid of characters at the bottom of which are a lot of empty squares (where characters would normally be present).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Libreoffice Writer.
2. Click on the Special Characters button in the toolbar.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the symbols grid.

Current Behaviour:

There are many blank/empty squares towards the bottom of the symbols grid.

Expected Behaviour:

The user should only be able to scroll down to the last symbol in the grid and no further.

I have attached a screenshot to show the problem. As can be seen in the screenshot I only scrolled about 3/4 of the way down and the rest were all empty squares. I am not sure whether this was done intentionally but it seems a bit strange to have lots of empty space for the user to scroll through.

I've got a Qotom T26H (http://www.m.amazon.com/dp/B00MTI4JIK) that uses a VIA C7-D processor. It was purchased specifically for the processor and testing software like OpenSSL and Crypto++.

The machine is running Lubuntu 15 and the Xserver crashes during boot. The stock Ubuntu Xserver crashes and a report was filed with Lubuntu at http://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/1540774. After adding the Xorg PPA the Xserver provided at xorg-edgers crashes too (http://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

There have been a number of reports sent to the openchrome-users mailing list because the log states to report the Unknown Card-Id there. I have not been able to find any reports in the bug tracker.

Here is the bug report. I hope it gets fixed before the release of OpenChrome 0.3.4 (re: Getting ready to release OpenChrome Version 0.3.4 https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openchrome-users/2016-February/007234.html).

    intel/eu: Switch to a logical state stack

    Instead of the state stack that's based on copying a dummy instruction
    around we start using a logical stack of brw_insn_states.  This uses a
    bit less memory and is way less conceptually bogus.

This introduced a small regression in Calc because now numbers with percent signs are considered as text not as numbers formatted as percents.

This is related to a problem with the percents cell format which does not include the non-break space between numbers and the % sign. Maybe fixing this would also fix the detection issue.?",379,"1"

"WAYLAND-89235","Microsoft mouse not recognized on GNOME with Wayland","Description of problem:
The Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3.0 mouse isn't being recognized by GNOME on Wayland. The USB ID is 045e:009d. GNOME on Wayland works fine with other mouse+keyboard wireless bundles like the Logitech (Holtek) with the USB ID 04d9:a01c.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 
libinput-0.7.0.x86_64 (2.20141211git58abea394.fc21)
mutter-3.14.3.x86_64 (1.fc21)


How reproducible: Always at least on this system.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the said mouse connected.
2. Start the GNOME on Wayland session trough gdm.
3. Try to move the said mouse.

Actual results:
It will not move/click altough it recognizes keyboard input and mouse input from other vendors.

Expected results:
Out-of-the-box working mouse support for all USB HID-compliant mouses.

Additional info:
Additional GPU is also not being recognized (I will open another bug for this which is waaaaay more complex).",13,"0"
"XORG-4999","Freeze while on MacMini possible related to sound usage.","(Note: This was reported to RH bugzilla. I was asked to report it here also. 
The xorg version provided by Red Hat is 6.8.2 based but I am not sure exactly
what has been patched.)

If I install any version (tried previous versions of xorg-x11 from the
development version) of xorg-x11 from FC-devel then I experience random
freezes/crashes on my MacMini.
Since I am in X I do not know what happened. There is nothing in the logs after
the freeze has happened.

I am not entirely sure which version the Fedora Core-devel version matches in
the plain xorg-x11.

It seems slightly related to the sound system but not entirely sure.

I use XFCE 4 (development version) and XFmedia.

I can use the new development version of as long as I do not try to listen to
music or sometimes even start the xfmedia application. Either I can listen to
music for a while (in X) and then a freeze occurs or the freeze happens as soon
as I open the xfmedia application.

I do not use the stock Red Hat kernel since this does not include power
management to control the fan (atleast it did not in earlier versions making the
fan run at full speed all times). I have experience these issues with kernels
2.6.12.5 2.6.13.1 and 2.6.14.

Also if I enable DRI in the xorg-x11 config file I can not use X at all. The
graphics do not seem so sync with the monitor correctly (the graphics is
severely corrupted - it looks like one single pixel line is compressed into only
a few pixels).

As included in the xorg-x11 config file below I also had to enable UseFBDev to
get any useful graphical output (atleast with the standard FC4 xorg-x11 releases).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
xorg-x11-6.8.2-58.ppc

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start X
2. Start xfmedia
3. Use computer in X and after a non-deterministic time a freeze will happen.

Actual Results:  The following operation causes freezes at random times.

Expected Results:  No freeze.

Additional info:

Every version I tried in the development version of X11 causes freezes.",470,"1"
"XORG-54387","Upgrade to evdev-2.7.0 (from 2.6.0) breaks mouse wheel on qemu-kvm guest with usb-tablet option","I'm running Gentoo Linux (64bit) as a qemu-kvm guest:

I use the `-usbdevice tablet` option to provide auto grab of the console on mouse-over.

This worked perfectly until I recently upgraded from evdev-2.6.0 to 2.7.0.  After the upgrade the mouse wheel stopped working.  Reverting evdev back to 2.6.0 fixes the problem.

(https://launchpad.net/bugs/68814) 
but am getting desperate to fix the problem so am entering it here too.

When I try to start the xserver using the vesa driver on my toshiba R100 with
Trident CyberBlade XP4m32 graphics card X takes up 100% of the CPU. The last
entry in Xorg.0.log is:

(II) VESA(0): Splitting WC range: base: 0xffffffff size: 0x2000000

The logs and the lspci output are attached to the ubuntu bug.

I've searched google and the xorg bugzilla extensively but not found anything
similar.

The vesa driver does appear to work on Fedora core 6 (with the same version of
X: 7.1.1) so perhaps this is an issue with Ubuntu's packaging or upgrade
procedure. Still I feel that X should give a meaningful error and abort rather
than hanging partway through.

Any suggestions about what to try would be much appreciated.",698,"1"

    fbo-blending-formats: Correct precision of signed normalized types.
    
    Signed types have less precision due to the sign bit.
    
    Without this it is impossible to devise an efficient way of lerping
    signed normalized types that makes this test happy -- it would require
    32bit float/int multiply and divides to get exact results.

It seems like the dbus server uses signals to return log lines but the http server does not seem to show them making them lost in the void. This makes setting up the HTTP server a bit of challenge :-)

I suspect that the syncevo-http-server does not need to call Close here but it probably isn't smart enough to know that and always tries. If it wasn't necessary then the only negative effect is this error message here.

As you probably noticed the syncevo-http-server is not particularly user-friendly. It started its life as a debugging utility and later got packaged because users started to find it useful.

Right now the expectation is that the syncevo-dbus-server is started manually and that its output is used to diagnose issues. The HOWTO implicitly describes that in the part about setting up client configs in the server which depends on detecting the device ID of new clients (see also https://bugs.meego.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1360).

The LogOutput feature was added later. I agree syncevo-dbus-server should print these messages.

It also should avoid the unnecessary Close method and probably be less verbose.

Patches welcome as always :-/ Anything assigned to  syncevolution-bugs@meego.bugs is not currently being worked on.

I assume you mean syncevo-http-server here?



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2010-12-27 13:45:05 +0000 ----

I'm improving syncevo-http-server output. syncevo-http-server output for the case where a client connects which has no config yet:

[INFO] sync: ./syncevo-dbus-server: ready to run
[INFO] syncevo-http: new SyncML session for 127.0.0.1
[ERROR] sync: no configuration found for deviceID foobar

How was the no sources active check configuration error triggered? I'd like to ensure that it is logged properly and that the excessive close() call is avoided but my first naive approach (ask for unknown URI) did not lead to the error.

Instead I got in the client:

[INFO] vcard30: server database not found check URI 'foobar'

The server later times out which did trigger the excessive close() call (error for that now suppressed).



---- Additional Comments From matthijs@stdin.nl 2010-12-27 14:36:38 +0000 ----

I think I got that error by creating a new peer without specifying any sources to make active. In other words I had sync = disabled in ~/.config/syncevolution/default/peers//sources/*/config.ini

At least I think I did I haven't actually tried to trigger the error again. Let me know if this doesn't work then I'll try a little harder.

When I try that I get the same error in the client as for an invalid URI:

  [INFO] vcard30: server database not found check URI 'addressbook'

> At least I think I did I haven't actually tried to trigger the error again.
> Let me know if this doesn't work then I'll try a little harder.  

Perhaps the code has changed. Never mind I think we can consider this issue resolved. Some testing and confirmation once I am done with revamping the syncevo-http-server would be nice.

"MODEMMANAGER-86713","novatel: improve probing for Dell branded modems","Dell rebrands modems from different vendors including Novatel Sierra and Ericsson. Until now we defaulted to the Novatel plugin when a Dell device was found but then we're breaking newer MBIM Sierra Dell-branded modems as we don't have MBIM support in the Novatel plugin.

So we should try to improve the probing in the Novatel Sierra and MBM plugins so that they probe also Dell devices and we'll then try to match via AT-probing which plugin should be handling the Dell device.

Quoting Dan:

The case we care about for Novatel is AT-only devices.  For those here
is a list of commands we can use to identify them and some sample
replies.  Built from the XU870 (Dell Wireless 5510) EX725 S720 E362.

We should only do this probing if the following are true:

1) The device only has AT ports eg it does *not* have any QMI MBIM or
net ports

2) The device does *not* report LTE capabilities via ATI or GCAP

Early Novatel QMI-capable devices (like the E362) support these commands
(at$nw*) but of course we don't want to treat them as AT-only Novatel.

If for some reason those don't work here are some more esoteric ones

"XORG-11295","Intel XV textured video broken with framebuffer width >2048","When playing movies via mplayer the textured video adapter doesn't show any output however things work when the overlay adapter is selected.

In particular it seems related to DRI and EXA. If DRI is disabled and acceleration is via XAA there is no output through the textured adapter. However if either DRI is enabled *OR* EXA is used the textured adapter works. In my case I disabled/enabled DRI by changing the framebuffer size (through the Virtual keyword in xorg.conf). With a width >2048 the Intel driver disables DRI. 

To reproduce:

 1) Boot up X with DRI disabled and use XAA -- use a Virtual size with width of 2049 or greater and 'Option AccelMethod XAA'
 2) Play a movie via mplayer selecting the Textured adapter. Note that no output is produced (there is no blue overlay -- only a black window).
 3) Restart X this time with either DRI enabled or EXA enabled.
 4) Play a movie via mplayer selecting the Textured adapter. Note that output is produced.",1,"0"

git bisect log

Error Description:
Since Kernel 5.1.x i had several GPU Hangs with my Hardware.
Typically when playing Video in mpv or using Chromium-Browser.
GPU Hang results in visible Lag/short hang/ not updating of the Desktop-UI (KDE).

Regression because:
Using LTS Kernel 4.9.x does not have theses issues with the same userspace.
5.0.x didnt have these issues either iirc

"POPPLER-7856","Transparent boxes are rendered opaque making text unreadable","The background of certain sections of a particular PDF appear white and since
the text is also white that results in the text being invisible. The text can be
made visible by highlighting the text in evince.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Download http://www.killernic.com/KillerNic/PDFs/KillerNic_TechSpecsHi.pdf
2. Open the downloaded file in evince .

Expected results:
The boxes behind the text should be transparent and the text readable. Stuntment

Actual results:
Large white squares over the PDF where some of the text is on both pages.

Additional Information:
The PDF displayed correctly in acroread acroread-7.0.8-0.4 on OpenSUSE 10.1.

"MESA-5148","[r300] Stale texture data used on first rendering","A small sample app for this issue is from libpcg tests/reactdiff_2d in TURING
mode (it's most visible there).  It's drawing a single texture that's evolving
over time.  After the texture has been updated the first drawing of it will
draw four sub-triangles of (presumably) the first triangle drawn using data
from the previous texture that was used.  Resizing the window to make it redraw
makes the misrendering go away.  It's somewhat visible while using the app and
very prominent when quitting the app while the texture is light-colored then
restarting.  The stale data will actually persist across X Server restarts.

Hacking up a fix for #5147 doesn't fix this.",272,"1"

[Problem]
Crash on HP Envy 14 with discrete ATI card and i5 integrated graphics.  Possibly due to a bad interaction between radeon and other framebuffer drivers.

[Original Description]
I'm running natty and every since the upgrade to 6.14.0 I've been unable to consistently boot.  After some discussion in the forums I tried repeatedly to boot into recovery mode.  In most cases I got a black screen.  One time though when I was able to successfully increase the brightness I saw some errors from the radeon module.

Is systemd trying to find out the unit of the notification sender but the sender (a forked systemd-notify) has already terminated?

Sometimes it even happens when the service is started so the READY message is lost.

I hit this trying the Linux demo for Amnesia: The Dark Descent:
http://www.amnesiagame.com/#demo

I started it at its lowest settings in windowed 640x480 mode. As soon as it starts trying to render the start-screen's background scene the desktop session/window manager starts going crazy as the window decorations turn white or disappear as does the taskbar/shell at the top and bottom of the screen. (I'm running the 'Ubuntu Classic' session so it was probably compiz.)

Nothing was responding to my clicks my Alt+F4s or my Ctrl+Cs (I launched Amnesia from gnome-terminal -- the ^C would appear but nothing happened). I VT-switched with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and back again and it threw me back to the gnome login screen. After I logged in again only the Software Rasterizer was available according to glxinfo.

dmesg

48 fps and 50 fps video decoding is stutter on UVD even 720p. UVD on Radeon 6310 with fglrx driver as able to decode up to 1080p 50 fps video with zero dropper frames so hardware is capable of decoding such framerate.
There is 48 fps sample http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11564551/Inception_trailer_48fps.mkv but I want to notice - many camcorders record 1080p50 or even 1080p60 video this days so this issue not just about trailers that upscaled from 24 to 48 fps.

On May 1 I sent a mail to Portland mailing list to request a new xdg-utils release: http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/portland/2009-May/001081.html

On May 6 I have forwarded the mail to Waldo in case he missed it.

Until today we didn't received any reply about it.

We (Rex Dieter and me) would like help to speed up the process as Waldo (current Portland administrator) seems to lack of time. Also we need to do some bugs triage.

Could we have admins right on Portland project ?

Indeed we don't want to hijack or take over the project but only re-inject some fresh blood. I expect waldo to be back as soon as possible. His agreement will be appreciated.

Cheers

"XORG-666","New XKB option for Tux keys: request for addition","Submitted by Daniel Elstner:

---

Basically the bottom row of my keyboard (which is just a standard pc105
model with three replaced caps) now looks like this:

           

In order to make the keyboard work as advertised on the key caps I need
to map the keys as follows:

     = Super_L
     = Alt_R Meta_R
     = Super_R

So I did just that by putting another option into symbols/altwin:

// Layout for Tux key caps with additional right Alt key
partial modifier_keys 
xkb_symbols alt_super_win {
    key  {        [       Alt_L  Meta_L          ]       }
    key  {        [       Alt_R  Meta_R          ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_L                 ]       }
    key  {        [       Super_R                 ]       }
    modifier_map Mod1   { Alt_L Alt_R Meta_L Meta_R }
    modifier_map Mod4   { Super_L Super_R }
}

Obviously I also need put this line into rules/xfree86:

altwin:alt_super_win    =       +altwin(alt_super_win)
 
And finally there's the description entry in rules/xfree86.xml.  The
description was a little hard to keep short since this option actually
sets up two modifier mappings.  However I'm not sure if splitting it
into separate options would actually be useful.  (This would require
adding another option group too since in this one multiple selections
are disallowed.)  Anyway here's the text:


  altwin:alt_super_win
  Alt is mapped to the right Win-key and Super to Menu.

 
If you look at the patch you'll see that I also changed two other option
entries in the XML file.  Those referred to option names which did not
exist looks very much just like a copy-n-paste mistake.",478,"1"

Bug detailed description:
-------------------------
This issue happens on two of our netbooks (945GME). 
This regression kind of block our conformance testing on those netbooks since
it take too much time to run.

Some OGLC cases now take much more time to run such as: 
colramp.c logicop.c pntrast.c api-coloru.c pxtrans-cirgbtex.c


Take colramp.c as an example it used to take less than 2 minutes now take more than 3 minutes to run.

After some time of investigating and bisection (we used case colramp.c for
bisection) we found it seems caused by following commit:

    drm/i915: enable memory self refresh on 9xx

    Enabling memory self refresh (SR) on 9xx needs to set additional
    register bits. On 945 we need bit 31 of FW_BLC_SELF to enable the
    write to self refresh bit and bit 16 to enable the write of self
    refresh watermark. On 915 bit 12 of INSTPM is used to enable SR.

    SR will take effect when CPU enters C3+ state and its entry/exit
    should be automatically controlled by H/W driver only needs to set
    SR enable bits in wm update. But this isn't safe in my test on 945
    because GPU is hung. So this patch explicitly enables SR when GPU
    is idle and disables SR when it is busy. In my test on a netbook of
    945GSE chipset it saves about 0.8W idle power.

hald-addon-storage crashes whenever the media status changes on my CD-ROM (ie.
on inserting or removing a CD into/from the drive). This seems to be caused by
calling libhal_device_set_property_*() without providing a properly
dbus_error_init()ed DBusError ie. calling libhal_device_set_property_*() with
NULL as the last parameter.

I'll attach a patch that fixes this problem. Changing the calls in
hald/linux/addons/hald-addon-storage.c would probably be an
easier/cleaner/better solution but all of the libhal_device_set_property_*()
functions in libhal/libhal.c do actually advertise @error: pointer to an
initialized dbus error object for returning errors or NULL. So a) passing NULL
 seems to be a perfectly valid thing to do and thus shouldn't cause crashes and
b) this might probably pop up somewhere else as well so it's better to remove
the cause rather than (only some of) the symptom(s).",0,"0"

    drm/i915: Parsing LFP brightness control from VBT

    LFP brighness control from the VBT block 43 indicates which
    controller is used for brightness.
    LFP1 brightness control method:
    Bit 7-4 = This field controller number of the brightnes controller.
    0 = Controller 0
    1 = Controller 1
    2 = Controller 2
    3 = Controller 3
    Others = Reserved
    Bits 3-0 = This field specifies the brightness control pin to be used on the
    platform.
    0 = PMIC pin is used for brightness control
    1 = LPSS PWM is used for brightness control
    2 = Display DDI is used for brightness control
    3 = CABC method to control brightness
    Others = Reserved

    Adding the above fields in dev_priv->vbt and corresponding changes in
    parse_backlight()

    v2: Jani's review comments addressed
        - Move PWM definitions to intel_bios.h
        - Moving vbt_version to intel_vbt_data
        - Rename brightness to bl_ctrl_data
        - Logging just control_pin instead of string
        - Avoid adding vbt_version in dev_priv
        - Since only DDI option is available as of now let control pin DDI
        affect dev_priv->vbt.backlight.present

    v3: Jani's review comments addressed
        - Drop control_pin
        - Use bdb->version
        - set controller to 0 instead of using control pin define
        - check controller bounds
        - remove superfluous changes in intel_parse_bios

"MESA-96410","[Perf] Pre validate _mesa_sampler_uniforms_pipeline_are_valid like _mesa_sampler_uniforms_are_valid","Hello

Profiling my app (PCSX2) it seems a fair amount of time is spend on the _mesa_sampler_uniforms_pipeline_are_valid. I only uses a single pipeline object so it always trigger revalidation of the pipeline which isn't ideal.

Anyway it feels that it ought to be possible to cache/prevalidate sampler of program like the _mesa_sampler_uniforms_are_valid function (which is the same function but for monolithic build). 

It would be nice to reduce the overhead of the function. Perf reports around 4% of nouveau_dri.so.

Thanks

Kernel: 2.6.11.4 and 2.6.13.1
drm.ko and i915.ko: from 6.8.99.16 current xorg and 2.6.13.1

To reproduce:
run gl-117 (in the URL tag of this build) in windowed mode and at the same
have any other DRI window open which overlaps gl-117. During the loading
phase of gl-117 everything works fine but when the main GL engine of gl-117
initializes X crashes with:

serial terminal capture (power on login shutdown)

Hi
 
this bug is similar to Bug 98200.

Since upgrade from kernel 4.8.17 to 4.9.{125} I am unable to restart or shutdown my PC. 
Poweroff/restart always ends with black screen (display shows no signal). 
System stays frozen with fans / hard discs spinning. 
Reset button does not bring the system back - it stays completely frozen.
Only manual (power button) power off/on cycle brings the system back.

patch

FcFreeTypeQueryFace currently sorts family names so that
TT_NAME_ID_PREFERRED_FAMILY is before TT_NAME_ID_FONT_FAMILY.

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/commit/?id=253ec7609c13b46c717c801206ebb1a6c7f06e27

FcGetDefaultObjectLangIndex then (effectively) reorders this list so that the
first in the list has a language close to FcGetDefaultLang().

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/commit/?id=904426816df300fad816238f0f27ef595a6a539b

This works mostly as expected except when FcGetDefaultLang() does not exactly
match any of the family name languages.

    radeon: Fix scissors for r600 KMS.

    Radeon generic scissors code had problem that some of code was using exclusive
    and some inclusive bottom right corner. Only r600 driver is using exclusive
    coordinate so changed generic code to pass inclusive coordinate and r600 driver
    changes BR coordinate to be exclusive.

"XORG-7364","'RenderBadGlyphSet (invalid GlyphSet parameter)' error on PPC64 with gtk applications","Hello

on PPC64 (most?) gtk applications crash on startup with the following error 
(for example the news reader pan):

The program 'pan' received an X Window System error. 
This probably reflects a bug in the program. 
The error was 'RenderBadGlyphSet (invalid GlyphSet parameter)'. 
  (Details: serial 2041 error_code 182 request_code 154 minor_code 23) 
  (Note to programmers: normally X errors are reported asynchronously 
   that is you will receive the error a while after causing it. 
   To debug your program run it with the --sync command line 
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful 
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Michel Dänzer pointed out that 'typedef unsigned long GlyphSet' isn't the same
size on 32/64 bit architectures so either the Render protocol or server code
isn't 32/64 clean.

"DBUS-98666","clients that can't send messages to an activatable service should not be able to autostart it","This feature request was previously discussed in the thread started at . See there for background.

The tldr version is: suppose the XML policy language or Linux LSM mediation (SELinux AppArmor) prevents client C from sending messages to activatable service S and also prevents that client from calling StartServiceByName(). It is (perhaps unexpectedly) still possible for C to autostart S by sending a message to S: the message will be rejected and in particular S won't receive it but S will still be started first.

The patch-set that I'm about to attach makes it possibly for the XML policy and LSMs to prevent this. Specifically:

* If the XML policy language would not allow C to send the message to S the
  message is now rejected *before* starting S.

* Similarly if AppArmor would not allow C to send the message to S the
  message is now rejected *before* starting S.

  - If the D-Bus .service file has a new AssumedAppArmorLabel key we
    will ask AppArmor to evaluate the policy rules as though S will
    have that AppArmor label.

  - If not we will ask AppArmor to evaluate the policy rules as though
    S will have an unspecified AppArmor label. Any allow or deny rule
    that matches peer=(label=something) will not match the worst case
    here is that C is allowed to make S be started but sending the actual
    message is later denied (in other words regressing to current behaviour).

* If the XML policy language would not allow S to *receive* the message
  the message is still not rejected until after S has started. (This is
  because until then we can't know what the process attributes of S will be
  in particular its uid and gid and because more generally we don't
  compute the list of access-control rules that will apply to S until it
  has actually connected and we probably don't want to compute that list.)

  The XML policy language's receive rules are not used in practice so this
  is not really a big problem.

* If AppArmor would not allow S to receive the message from C
  the message is also still not rejected until after S has started to be
  consistent with the policy language. It would be possible to be
  symmetrical with the send rules for services with AssumedAppArmorLabel
  but not for services that do not have it (we cannot query an unspecified
  policy so we would effectively have to assume 'unconfined') I think
  that would probably be more confusing than the current situation.

I haven't implemented SELinux mediation because I don't use SELinux but I did pass the same information to selinux.c as to apparmor.c so that it would be easy for someone else to do.",20,"0"

"CAIRO-3402","Cairo should support non-srcdir builds","Cairo should support building in a directory separate from the source directory.
 For example GTK's autogen.sh can be run from a separate directory where all
build-related files will end up:

[gtk+-bld]$ /home/fitzsim/sources/gtk+/autogen.sh --prefix=/home/fitzsim/install

Cairo's configury should also support this form of operation.  It means that
build files don't clutter up the source directory so e.g. grep doesn't search
through .o files.  Also it means you can clear out the build files simply by
just rm -rf builddir.  JHBuild assumes this mode of operation by default.",87,"1"
"MESA-15269","R200 crashes in glXMakeCurrent if GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI is enabled","Created attachment 15570
Test demonstrating the problem

When making a context current that had GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI enabled possibly activated before the context was unset earlier then Mesa crashes in r200UpdateFragmentShader in r200_dri.so. The attached test program illustrates this issue.

The sample program creates and activates a GL context using glut enables GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI unsets the context and reactivates it. It can be compiled with gcc fragshader.c -o fragshader -lGL -lglut. Possibly the GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI constant has to be defined if the OpenGL header does not do so.

A workaround for this issue is to deactivate GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI before unsetting a context so reactivating it works. Afterwards GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ATI can be safely reenabled. Existing fragment shaders work correctly afterwards and sharing them via display list sharing works correctly as well.

The Mesa version is 7.0.2 according to glxinfo bugzilla won't let me select this version. The GL renderer string is Mesa DRI R200 20060602 AGP 1x x86/MMX/SSE2 TCL",2,"0"

debug dmesg with drm-tip kernel

Hello!

I find that mouse cursor is always flicker on external displays attachable to CherryTrail-based Dell 5855 tablet. 

modesettings DDX (Ubuntu Defaut) - cursor flicker frequently on all movement artifacts under cursor sometimes long tail (for example above terminal window with changing content or above Nautilus that render loading animation) link to video is below
Intel DDX DRI3 - same as with modesetting DDX.
Intel DDX DRI2 HWCursor - cursor flicker when content below cursor is changes but don't left tail
Intel DDX DRI2 SWCursor - almost same as HWCursor but seems like cursor flickering start not after boot or after web-browser Nautilus or terminal launch but few minutes later.

Video for DRI3 variant of this issue:
https://mega.nz/#!JNpBharA!giDibmmE9he9NkqR13pGncLrxCCZhoIY27K3cU7vRsY (please pay attention to the ending).

Attached dmesg debug from boot with Intel DDX DRI3 (moving gnome-recorder above htop then just moving cursor above htop cursror left very long tail).

Hardware:
Dell 5855 tablet with Intel Atom x5-Z8500
Tested docking soltuions:
1. Dell Dock WD15
2. Dell S2718D display attached to tablet directly via USB-C
3. Belkin USB-C 3.1 Express Dock HD
No difference was found cursor flicker with all three. However there is no such issue if I attache Skylake and KabyLake-based laptops to listed docks.

Software:
Ubuntu Gnome 17.04-18.04 x86_64

    draw: cleanup the extra attribs
    
    Before inserting new front face and prim id outputs cleanup
    the old extra outputs otherwise our cache will use previous
    output slots which will break as soon as outputs of the current
    shader don't match the last.

PDF to show the problem

pdftops (no options required) generates bad postscript for the attached PDF.
I tested pdftops 0.45.0 and some older versions and even xpdf 3.03 pdftops and they all generate ps that gets /rangecheck in --xyshow--
xpdf 3.02pl2 pdftops is ok but it uses TJm instead of Tj and messes up fonts with vertical positioning.
gs pdf2ps generates a valid ps.
Considering that the pdf is viewable by several applications and that gs pdf2ps and old xpdf pdftops can both produce a valid ps I think that the problem is in poppler pdftops rather than in the pdf.
I thought that xyshow could get a rangecheck only if the number of xy pairs was shorter than the string but adding an extra 0 0 to the array of xy pairs did not help.

I just were browsing the code and I discovered that in wl_buffer_put is possible to put into buffer more than 8192 bytes at once which means that we will use memory which doesn't belong to wl_buffer.

valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:294 (get_bszB_as_is): Assertion 'bszB_lo == bszB_hi' failed.
valgrind: Heap block lo/hi size mismatch: lo = 2560 hi = 18446744073709519887.
This is probably caused by your program erroneously writing past the
end of a heap block and corrupting heap metadata.  If you fix any
invalid writes reported by Memcheck this assertion failure will
probably go away.  Please try that before reporting this as a bug.

Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
It contains workarounds to several common problems.
In particular if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
identifying problems in your program there's a good chance
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
crashing especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.

If that doesn't help please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

In the bug report send all the above text the valgrind
version and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.

"XORG-6613","evdev hijacks the /dev/input/eventX device","Hi! 

I've been using X.org 6.8 with evdev mouse driver (hacked into X.org by gentoo)
for a while along with the evrouter program to manage extra buttons on my MS
Wireless Explorer mouse. This program monitors /dev/input/event_usb
(udev-created link to this mouse's evdev interface) and does specified actions
(simulates key presses) when extra mouse buttons are pressed.

All this worked fined until I installed X.org 7.0.

When I run X the mouse works fine but evrouter no longer works. Apparently X
somehow gets exclusive access to /dev/input/event_usb because even cat
/dev/input/event_usb produces absolutely no output when I move my mouse / press
any buttons on it. So evrouter doesn't read any mouse events from
/dev/input/event_usb.

This only pertains to the evdev mouse driver my trackpoint (handled by regular
mouse driver) produces output when I cat /dev/input/event_trackpoint.

dmesg

When I compile xf86-video-intel with sna and using gnome shell it sometimes freezes the whole Xserver. This happens approx once a day of normal usage and so far I haven't found a reliable way to reproduce (just move windows between workspaces a lot maybe with opengl apps it may freeze faster but not sure). I can't do anything even switching to console doesn't work however I can still ssh in. All my attempts to obtain a backtrace through ssh were unsuccessful. When i try to attach to X with gdb it just freezes the same happens when I'm already attached to it at the moment of incident. There is some interesting info in the dmesg. Also attaching Xorg log. (Logs are few days old however the incident just happened toady with bleeding edge stack).
BTW I was using UXA with no problems for a week. SNA lasts at most for 2 days.

mesa-drm: cc745fcc3a16cb1ffc2ab578155dc880b862f95a

The problem is that right after the X-server is started up (by the gdm) the screen doesn't update anymore. It displays a solid bluish color and after that stays like that. The X-server is running fine in the 'background' because I can login via gdm by blind typing in my login name and password. I can also switch to the vt and back now leaving me with a black screen.

I currently solve this problem by removing the drm and i915 kernel module from my /lib/modules directory. If the intel driver can't load the module starting works without problems and the correct screen content is displayed. Of course I don't get any hw acceleration this way.

I don't have the problem since this special git version but some versions back later. I didn't report this because I rarely needed hw acceleration in the past times but now I find it really annoying.

Going to attach Xorg logs...

A calc sheet reproducing the matrix computation issue

Problem description: 
When recomputing matrix values computed by a libreoffice-basic function which returns an array CALC shows erratic errors 522 even though there are no circular references in the spreadsheet and the called BASIC function works perfectly fine under the debugger.

How to reproduce the issue:
- Open the attached Calc document. This document contains zero macro and 1 BASIC function (named LOESS1) implementing a Local regression fitting (a.k.a. LOESS) algorithm (which has been successfully tested elsewhere). This function returns an array of Double and is called in the formula of a cell matrix (located in column C)
- Say yes to the activate macros question. The document gets open with no error in column C.
- Type a different number value in B3 (e.g. 76.8). The column C gets recomputed ending up with cells containing Err:522.

"MESA-109659","Missing OpenGL symbols in OSMesa Gallium when building with meson","Building OSMesa Gallium with meson leads to missing exported OpenGL symbols in libOSMesa.so compared to using the autotools/configure script.

Use case/context: ParaView in-situ analysis and rendering (https://blog.kitware.com/messing-with-mesa-for-paraview-5-0vtk-7-0/)

When using meson to build OSMesa from Mesa 18.3:

$ meson [sourcedir] -Dosmesa=gallium
$ ninja

I noticed that libOSMesa.so does not export OpenGL symbols:

$ nm -D src/gallium/targets/osmesa/libOSMesa.so | grep  T 
000000000006cbe0 T OSMesaColorClamp
000000000006c6a0 T OSMesaCreateContext

000000000006cc00 T OSMesaPixelStore
000000000006cee0 T OSMesaPostprocess

However using the autotools/configure script (Mesa 18.3):

$ [sourcedir]/autogen.sh --enable-gallium-osmesa
or from release tarball
$ [sourcedir]/configure --enable-gallium-osmesa
$ make

the generated library exports the whole OpenGL API:

$ nm -D lib/gallium/libOSMesa.so | grep  T 
0000000000558f80 T glAccum
000000000055e300 T glActiveShaderProgram

00000000005572b0 T OSMesaPostprocess

This behavior has been witnessed on up-to-date ArchLinux and Ubuntu 18.04.

Assuming this is a bug in the Meson build script one quick fix would be to edit src/gallium/targets/osmesa/meson.build and move libglapi_static from the link_with section to the link_whole section in the osmesa library declaration:

diff --git a/src/gallium/targets/osmesa/meson.build b/src/gallium/targets/osmesa/meson.build
index b4ae8f4b6ec..e873e311aa0 100644

However being quite new at building Mesa and maybe missing the big picture I'm not sure
* if what I'm describing here is really a bug or is intentional and
* if there is some unforeseen consequences of the aforementioned quick fix.

Is there a more appropriate way to use OpenGL through OSMesa?

"DRI-103277","[bisected] Systems hangs on resume from S3 sleep due to Match actual state during S3 resume commit","After I updated my kernel to https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~agd5f/linux/log/?h=amd-staging-drm-next as of today (latest commit at this time: 	1c630e83443a0f271c192ecfa0d94023661a0000) I noticed that my computer would no longer wake up from S3 sleep - power LED goes on but apart from that no display and no reaction to any input (other than Num-Lock still switchable).

The difference to the ~2 weeks older kernel was 100% reproducable by just doing:

- boot to console (no start of X11 required) and login as root
- echo mem >/sys/power/state
- wait till power LED blinks
- press some key to wake up the system
- observe no display output and no reaction to anything

GPU is a RX 460 CPU a Ryzen R7 1800X board Asus X370 Pro connected is one 4k display via HDMI 2.0.

I bisected the git commits and the one that causes the bug is:

>  7ae4acd21e9e264afb079e23d43bcf2238c7dbea
>  drm/amd/display: Match actual state during S3 resume.

After this I went back to the current HEAD of amd-staging-drm-next and (manually) reverted only commit 7ae4acd21e9e264afb079e23d43bcf2238c7dbea and this indeed results in a kernel that works fine with regards to resuming from S3 sleep.

There are no noteworthy dmesg-emissions that accompany going to S3 sleep but the dmesg-output that I can collect ends slightly before the system actually sleeps so wether anything is emitted upon the wake-up attempt I have no way to know.",258,"1"

"XORG-69477","Disable VT switching and enable VT sharing by default for non-seat0 seats","Currently systemd-multi-seat-x wrapper is still needed in some multiseat setups.
When -seat option is passed with an argument different from seat0 systemd-multi-seat-x does the following:

1. pass option -sharevts to real X server

2. create a special xorg.conf file with the following content (or similar):

Section ServerFlags
    Option DontVTSwitch true
EndSection

Section InputClass
    Identifier Force input devices to seat
    Option GrabDevice true
EndSection

The purpose of this bug is to enable VT sharing (no need of passing -sharevts) and disable VT switching (no need of Option DontVTSwitch true in xorg.conf) when seat is not seat0.

Another patch for evdev driver is needed to get rid of Option GrabDevice true in xorg.conf",156,"1"

kernel dmesg log & NVDABMP FCODE ROM

Hi

When running a Powermac 11.2 (G5 Quad - powerpc64) with a Quadro FX4500 (NV47) previous kernels had no issue extracting the FCODE ROM / DCB block via the OpenFirmware device tree.
Last vanilla kernel that i have compiled that seemed to work fine was kernel 3.18.16.
Normally it will find the BIT SIGNATURE via OpenFirmware method.

However when compiling a newer vanilla kernel 4.1.2 nouveau seems to have an issue reading the FCODE ROM / DCB block / from the OpenFirmware device tree.
Also interestingly this time around it attempts to use the PROM method and attempts to find the BIT SIGNATURE via this method.
Apparently it found a signature but looks like garbage and seems like it cant extract the DCB BLOCK.

As instructed i have attached a dmesg.log along with a dump of the NVDABMP image out of the following folder: /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/pci@0f0000000/NVDAParent@0/.

Not sure if this is correct but i have passed the following nouveau module options as i understood:

options nouveau config=NvMSI=0debug=debugVBIOS=trace

I have placed the kernel dmesg log along with the NVDABMP dump in the attached nouveau_powerpc64_pmac11.2.tar.xz archive.

Please let me know if there is any more info required.

Thanks for your help!

Test file

The RAND() function of Calc was fixed on bug 33365. Yet the same bug is present with the Rnd random number generation function of BASIC as well.

Even with as few records as 1000 the random numbers repeat themselves several times. Test document (ODS) with test macro attached.

TEST PROCEDURE:
1. Open the attached document
2. Click the Generate button to (re-)generate 1000 numbers. Wait for Generation Status to change from Started... to Ready


EXPECTED RESULTS:
2. Cell D1 shows 1.00000000 (i.e. no repetition of values in the B column)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
2. Value of D1 always bigger than 1.00000000 (between 1.02200000 and 1.04400000 on just a few tests) due to many repeated values in the B column. (Column C shows how many times a number is repeated.)


WinXP Home 32 bit LO 4.0.5.2 release


NOTES:
- The issue does not occur on with the test file attached to bug 33365 which tests the RAND() function of Calc. To achieve comparable results my attached file is based on that file and uses the same evaluation methods.

- Usage of the Randomize generator initialization function before the first Rnd usage does not work around the problem.

- Calc RAND() fix commit http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=8450a99c744e9005f19173e4df35d65640bcf5c4 says that seed() initialises the state of the global random number generator and it should only be called once at the start of the main programme. So maybe the latter information should be added to the description of the Randomize function in LO help. Because according to that information additional later seeding of the random number generator would make it loose the entropy it has accumulated so far. (Assuming it does accumulate it continuously since application start.)",214,"1"

Picture showing cursor and other corruption

An external screen connected via reverse PRIME works (has a picture) except that the cursor is corrupted in a way such that accurating pointing to text and menus is often impossible. Text in Konsole (KDE) also corrupted. This happens only on the external screen hovering over the laptop screen is fine.

Attached is a picture showing cursor corruption and issues with a menu in KDE Plasma (I moved from right to left and opened a nested menu by hovering). The cursor trace and corrupted text while typing was also reproduced on a bare X server so it is not limited to composited desktops.

Hardware:
- i7-6700HQ (eDP1 output source intel i915)
- Nvidia GTX 965M (DP-1 output sink modesetting nouveau)

Further information:
with modesetting for both the Nvidia and Intel devices there is no corruption. I do have to set vblank_mode=0 otherwise the external screen refreshes windows with 1fps when glxgears is displayed on just the external screen. If the window is just partially displayed on eDP-1 the frame rate is normal again.

Also tried using UXA instead of SNA but that is even worse. When switching tabs / opening a new page in Firefox for example the left bottom triangle shows the previous content that was supposed to be shown while the right top triangle shows the currently expected picture (if you are lucky). Similar for Konsole terminal output.

Here is another bug about corruption maybe it is the same issue?

I setup a bluetooth speaker using pulseaudio + pulseaudio-module-bluetooth + bluez and a physical bluetooth adapter on host computer and I changed the bluetooth device alias to 蓝牙音箱 Bluetooth Speaker [DELL Optiplex 3300].

Then I connected to this bluetooth device on client computer but I can't see 蓝牙音箱 characters in pavucontrol or mate-volume-control or pacmd like they are been stripped out.

It doesn't make much sense but everything seems to work normally within one window (this is running Gnome with Wayland on F25) but as soon as I move to a different window clicks on the middle or right button are reported as left button clicks - that much I have confirmed using libinput-debug-events to monitor events.

The incorrect reporting seems to persist for as long as my finger remains in contact with the touchpad no matter how many times I click but lifting it right off the pad briefly normally fixes things and causes the next click to be reported correctly though sometimes it takes a couple of attempts especially for the right button.",2,"0"

There are versioned package names that install files to non-versioned directories.

both core as well as extension packages are affected. For example

/opt/libreoffice/program/kdefilepicker is in package 

libreoffice3.3-core01 and
libreoffice3.4-core01

As both have a different name the libreoffice3.4-core01 is not considered an update of libreoffice3.3-core01 thus rpm as well as dpkg try to install the 3.4-0beta2 one alongside of the 3.3.2 one and of course fails because both packages include the same files (the same filepaths)

It's a bad idea to have versioned package names when they use a non-versioned directory. The only way to do a clean update in this case is to add tons of Obsoletes statements in all affected packages.

#########################################################
Two ways to solve this dilemma

1) Allow packages to installed along each other (except the desktop-integration one - you have to decide which version should be in your DE's menu what should be default for the corresponding mime-types)

In this case make the installation directory versioned as well. /opt/libreoffice3.4/..... for example

2) Have 3.4.0 be an update to previous version(s)

In this case remove the version from the package names and add a corresponding Obsoletes: 3.3 to the packages
(or put a hard break to it without adding Obsoletes-directive and make manual uninstallation of previous versions mandatory for the users by putting it in big letter to the release notes)

(note that neither of the above is a replacement for special development versions that can always be inside alongside release(candidate) versions like bug #36437 requests)",12,"0"

System information:
    Wine build: wine-2.18 (Staging)
    Platform: i386
    Version: Windows 7
    Host system: Linux
    Host version: 4.13.5-1-MANJARO

GPU: R9 280X (GCN 1.0)
GPU driver: xf86-video-ati 1:7.10.0-1 (radeonsi)

Game version: 3.0.1e (Steam)

# Overview
So when using mesa 17.2+ with wine-staging-nine the whole system crashes
when entering certain areas on PoE.

After trying to enter my Hideout in the game the loading screen appears for a
few seconds (as usual) then a sound loop occurs for about 3 seconds then
silence and the whole system is completely unresponsive.
The keyboard does not work and the monitor has no video output (blue screen).
Then I just hard-reset the system.

Also a few days ago the game somehow crashed without bringing the whole
system down it just showed a game crashed dialog box.

# Game-specific info
I tried to enter the affected areas from Highgate (Act 9) which seems to have
no major issues after wandering around a bit.
So far it seems to crash on Sarn and the personal Hideout.
The only similarity that I can think of is the presence of Vagan and Vorici in
both areas.
But AFAIK it seems unlikely that characters textures would cause a GPU hang.

# Rambling
It is the exact same symptom (including the sound loop) that occured on my
6770m with Linux 3.13+ when I tried to run startx without setting
radeon.dpm=0.

# Debug
The whole screen including the terminal wine is launched from freezes so I'm
unable to see if wine printed anything during/after the crash.
I tried setting MESA_DEBUG=1 and MESA_LOG_FILE but nothing is ever written to
the log file (it is not even created).
I'm not sure if it is because everything really hangs no mesa errors actually
occur or if I need to compile it with debug flags.
In the case of the latter should I just follow this guide?
https://wiki.ixit.cz/d3d9_debugging

Also I'm not really sure whether the problem is on mesa or gallium-nine.
If you know how to debug this please leave a comment.

# Packages
After testing with different packages the problem occurs only with
wine-staging-nine.
Tested on wine-staging-nine 2.16+ (2.16-2.18) and mesa 17.2.0+ (17.2.0-17.2.2).

Mesa < 17.2.0 has no problems with wine wine-staging nor wine-staging-nine.
Wine + gallium-nine works well enough with mesa < 17.2.0.

Misc: At least on manjaro mesa 17.1.8 depends on llvm 4.0 and mesa 17.2+
depends on llvm 5.0.
Not sure if the version could be related to the issue.",213,"1"

"MESA-12141","glDrawElements bug for large array via indirect glx plus patch","When connected to a remote x-server using indirect glx the glDrawElements client side vertex array routine has a bug for large arrays.

The bug is in routine emit_DrawElements_old in file:
Mesa/src/glx/x11/indirect_vertex_array.c

If the number of elements is too large to fit into a single X packet it has to be spilt into multiple requests using the X RenderLarge command.  emit_DrawElements_old loops through the number of requests required outputting the maximum number of elements for a single request each time.  But it does not increment the start element pointer so that the first batch of elements is repeatedly sent in every request.  Elements towards the end of the input array are therefore never sent and not rendered.

The emit_DrawElements_old routine implements the GL 1.1 DrawArrays protocol.  This is the current protocol (old is a misnomer) used by X servers which support OpenGL including Xorg 7.x.  The bug can be demonstrated by sending a large glDrawElements array to a remote display server.",3,"0"

I can provoke an oom on xorg as attached by displaying a couple of 1920 xwds with display from ImageMagick and flipping between then plus some middle mouse clicking (which magnifys a section and gives info on the pixel clicked).

"DRI-91438","hard lockup after switching between laptop's panel and external monitor","Created attachment 117314
relevant dmesg and laptop info

When docking my laptop I usually use xrandr to turn off the laptop's display so that my taskbar and network applets are displayed properly on my external monitor.
When trying to debug some unrelated stuff I found out that I could hard lock the laptop after switching back and forth a few times between both monitors.

It took quite a bit of time to reproduce the problem. It happens only when the laptop is docked.

How to reproduce:
- laptop docked external monitor on VGA port (no dongle)
- the following steps trigger a hard lockup:

# try1
xrandr --output $PANEL --off
xrandr --output $EXT --auto
xrandr --output $PANEL --auto
xrandr --output $EXT --off

# try2
xrandr --output $PANEL --off
xrandr --output $EXT --auto # the external panel stays blank
xrandr --output $PANEL --auto # locks a bit after here
xrandr --output $EXT --off

note that the blocks are identical - ie there's no problem the first time but running the same commands a second time trigger the lockup. Both displays are black/blank so there's no way to even see what's happening.

The xrandrvga script in the attached tgz outputs dmesg + xrandr --verbose after each switch. The debug files show that the output of xrandr --verbose after setting the panel to auto in the 2nd try is 0. So I'm not sure if it's because of running xrandr or because the next command (turning off the external panel) triggers the hard lockup and the output file is not flushed to disk.

note:
- when docked the external monitor shows up as DP2-3 and it's DP2 when undocked (= plugged in the laptop's VGA port).
- enable_psr=0 enable_fbc=0

Hardware: lenovo T450s model 20BX000TBM (see attached dmidecode and lspci_vv).

file to demonstrate incorrect pivottable behavior

Problem description: 
When creating a pivottable from data in spreadsheet the vertical aggregation/grouping is incorrect - it contains multiple equal entries.

Steps to reproduce:
1. create a simple data table according to attached file.
2. create pivottable with vertical aggregation values from column x-axis horizontal aggregation values from y-axis and sum-values from z-axis
3. look at created table

Current behavior:
vertical aggregation contains multiple equal entries

Expected behavior:
unique vertical aggregation values

Patch

Using (on Fedora 9):

hal-0.5.11-2.fc9.x86_64
hal-info-20080607-1.fc9.noarch

My HP 6500 laptop's recovery partition is no longer ignored by hal and its mounted when I log in. Looking at the exceptions in 20-storage-methods.fdi there is a rule:

      
      
        
          true
        
      

However this doesn't match for me because the recovery partition is NTFS. I'm not sure why anything is checking the fstype but I've attached a patch to look for either.

Alex Deucher and I narrowed it down to bad EXA/Composite interaction on IRC. Turning on EXANoComposite seems to work around it.

Neither dmesg nor Xorg.0.log seem to show anything.


I've observed this behaviour before CS branch merge but only after the GLX app has run for significantly longer or if I move around the window the app is in. Did not report earlier as I was unsure if it was due to my power management code.

"TELEPATHY-26712","Telepathy-logger should support storing and retrieving favorite Telepathy contacts","It'd be handy and nicely-centralized to have the Telepathy logger store and manage a set of favorite Telepathy contacts.

I've created a branch of the logger which adds and implements a simple API for this. The upside to doing this in one place is that different Telepathy-based IM clients can use the same set of favorites.

Danielle could you please review this?

You can browse my branch at the given URL (it's up-to-date with the mainline as of this writing).

The only change is the last commit (though it's several hundred lines splitting it didn't seem useful).

There are a few open questions (comments including the keyword XXX). One of the bigger ones (which may or may not still have a comment in my latest version) is whether the favorite contacts functionality should have its own namespace (vs. org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Logger[.DRAFT]).

I also wish I could have avoided the FavouriteContactsIsReady property and FavouriteContactsReady signal altogether. But there doesn't seem to be any other way that doesn't either expose a race condition between the logger deserializing the favorite contacts file or adding some excessive infrastructure (like queues for method calls that arrive between the start and end of that deserialization). Beyond that the first is gramatically awkward (and inappropriate for a property?) and they sound like synonyms to me anyhow.

I'm looking forward to any and all critiques.",3,"0"

Test case which clears a depth-stencil attachment

Attached: test application to reproduce bug (see https://github.com/rikusalminen/querystall for build scripts etc. needs c99 compiler and CFLAGS).

GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_API GL_DEBUG_TYPE_PERFORMANCE GL_DEBUG_SEVERITY_MEDIUM  id: 0xb
CPU mapping a busy query object BO stalled and took 2.003 ms.

Clearing GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24 target (instead of GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8) does not cause this behavior.

GL_TIME_ELAPSED or GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED queries do not give this error.

21:14  the clear isn't hitting our best-case scenario and is falling back to a meta use-GL-to-implement-GL path that wants to disable occlusion queries so our internal usage doesn't contribute fragments
21:14  and the way it does that stalls

21:21  fast depth only does depth...
21:22  I don't know why we wouldn't be using blorp for stencil

According to the man pages of posix_fallocate it returns zero on
success or an error number on failure however  errno is not set
on failure. If the kernel or a library other than glibc does not
support the function for example EOPNOTSUPP will be returned and
the error will not be handled properly with original code.

I was amazed tracing the exceptions through here that we go looking for trouble (and creating directories) in ~/.ure - why ? and /etc/opt/ure/ and other apparently unhinged locations -)

Anyhow - it seems the problem is a change of status of the HybridPDFImport - I attach my ~/.config/libreoffice/3-suse/ directory which contains:

"POPPLER-94517","page.text() does not take page orientation into account","See also: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2016-March/011755.html

When extracting text from a landscape pdf file using the cpp
interface text at the far right of the page does not get extracted .I
think the problem is that page.text() always assumes portrait
orientation and hence underestimates the width of the page:

  p->text()
  p->text(p->page_rect())

Is this expected? What is the best way to extract all text from the

"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-84789","Adding Azerty Russian layout support","Created attachment 107538
updated ru file containing the phonetic_azerty and phonetic_azerty_fr layouts

Bug Description

Users of azerty keyboards lack of Russian phonetic layout. Their only option is to use phonetic qwerty. This is not really acceptable so I propose to add support with the attached patches for azerty Russian phonetic wit the following variants:
 - ru(phonetic_azerty): basic phonetic azerty
 - ru(phonetic_fr): French specific phonetic azerty. This completes the 3rd level following the French layout (Alt Gr + a key)

base.xml.patch patches /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.xml
base.lst.patch patches /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
evdev.xml.patch patches /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml
ru.patch patches /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ru

Please tell me if anything is wrong or could be improved. Please also note that I know almost nothing of the Russian language and its Cyrillic alphabet so there could be errors.

We also could want to add this layout for users coming from Windows and used to it : http://tnit.fr/aa.htm

Cheers
Raphaël.

"XORG-24330","wrong detected monitor resolution","Created attachment 30092
Stock driver from debain testing version 1.2.5

Somewhere between the 1.2.5 and today's git something changed the way monitor's resolutions are detected. I didn't do much git updates since and I don't have the time right now to figure out which commit did the trick (though I did go as far as 5 commits back from the current one) but at least for the time being I'm attaching both xorg logs (the one with the 1600x1200 resolution is the right one whilst the maximum I got was 1360x768 - see the log).

Hopefully someone could figure out without going through commits what could be a potential cause for this and point me to a probable commit.

When I have time I'll do the searching myself but that won't happen at least until the weekend.",4,"0"
"CAIRO-16469","Device offset is not affected by scaling","While implementing a new CSS feature in Mozilla Gecko I stumbled across a bug regarding device offsets and scaling that make the feature quite glitchy.

Device offsets seem to be unaffected by scaling when painted onto a surface with scaling applied.

e.g. - surface A is scaled by 0.5 0.5
- surface B has a device offset of -40 -40.
- draw a rectangle on surface A at X=40 Y=40 width=20 height=20. This means the actual size is 20 20 10 10 due to scaling.
- draw a rectangle of exactly the same coordinates on surface B.
- mask or paint surface B onto surface A.

The result is that the rectangle on surface B is painted at half-size but it is drawn at 40 40 so the device offsets didn't allow the X or Y of B's rectangle to be scaled like A's.

Hopefully this can be fixed soon as this blocks a proper implementation of text-shadow and box-shadow in Gecko.",29,"1"
"XORG-3904","Problems with Xinerama: Trident 975Im�ge (PCI) and SiS520 (AGP)","Hi

I am running X11R6-6.8.1 in a 598MLR motherboard with on-board AGP video
(SiS520) i put one Trident 975Imàge in PCI slot and try to use Xinerama.
But a few things happens:

1. In first time all got ok only a little flickering in screen.
2. If i Ctrl+Alt+BS and start X again the SiS video works OK but the
   Trident video looses the correct frequency and i lose the image (sometimes
   the screen goes to 800x600 instead 1280x1024).
3. If i Crtl+Alt+BS again and start X again both screens loose their video.
   Ctrl+Alt+BS don't works (ok it works but i don't got console back!).

This things all happens in 16bit mode. In 24bit mode the Trident screen
got very confused and flickering. I try many times only one time i got an
real error message talking about vm86 error on trident module.

If i put the primarly display on PCI and second on AGP the system goes to
3. in the first time. If i disable vesa framebuffer the things are more
stable but the 1. flickering continues.",573,"1"

when a rudder pedals (e.g. 06a3:0763 Saitek PLC Pro Flight Rudder Pedals) are connected the /dev/input/jsX and /dev/input/eventX are created. The problem is that while jsX device has 644 permissions (enybody can read) the eventX device is available only to root while any other joystick-like device receives ACLs for the current user.

If I'm not mistaken the culprit is in the joystick detection heuristics - it looks for some axes and buttons while these devices have only three axes.

Would it be possible to either extend the joystick detection heuristics to handle such devices (CH products pedals reportedly behave the same) or to create some exceptions for them so these devices would work out of the box?

Please let me know if you need any more informations.

"LIBREOFFICE-67637","CONFIGURATION: Hidden event listener","Problem description:

The spreadsheet contains a hidden event listener.
It cannot be seen in Tools->Customize... in the Event tab
but it triggers the macro if the appropriate event happens. 

Steps to reproduce:
I could not recreate this behaviour but I will describe what happened.

I worked on a spreadsheet where I assigned a macro to the event
  'Modified' status was changed
The macro sits in My Macros.Standard.Module1
That worked fine.
I continued to work on the macro in the macro editor when LibreOffice crashed.
I started LibreOffice again and the file recovered well.


Current behavior:

After recovering the file I went to Tools->Customize... again and the assignment had disappeared.
There is nothing shown in the   'Modified' status was changed   line.
But when I change something in the spreadsheet the macro runs as before.
Assigning something new to  'Modified' status was changed  has no effect.

Expected behavior:

The macro should not run as there is no visible assignment to  'Modified' status was changed .


I checked the following:
I added a macro assignement to the  Save Document  event and then I investigated content.xml 
I found these lines (linebreaks by me)









This means: my hidden event trigger (executing the SortRange macro) is wrapped in   officeooo:event-listeners  tags whereas the normal events are wrapped in   office:event-listeners   tags. 
I have no idea where these tags come from and why its contents are executed.

Reproducible: Always with .903 not with .902 or .901

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch to virtual console and make some output occur (e.g. dmesg)
2. Switch back to X with Ctrl-Alt-F7

Actual Results:  
Fonts are corrupted can't read anything.

"DRI-33867","[bisected] Graphics corruption related to pageflip ioctl support in 2.6.38-rc*","Created attachment 42887
Commits not present in 2.6.37 applied to local branch

I am troubleshooting some graphics corruption I noticed when testing the post-2.6.37 commits from drm-airlied git (drm-fixes in this case).  I was trying to produce a kernel as close as possible to the latest stable release (since 2.6.38 is very early in the rc stage) with all of the newest radeon-related features.

This is a preliminary report and may turn out to be invalid because the kernel I am using is actually a local branch from v2.6.37 with only the commits from drm-airlied relevant to my hardware individually cherry-picked.  I have bisected the problem down to a specific commit but if I made any errors during the cherry-pick process then this report is useless.  I plan to confirm that the problem is real tomorrow by building directly from the drm-airlied/drm-fixes tree (which was the most up-to-date tree I could find today).

As I will report below there is some similarity with

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33515

and that is the only reason I decided to report my findings before I am really sure there is a problem.  Hopefully this will help Michel and other devs save some time and trouble if my guess (that my bug is related) turns out to be correct.
----------------------

OK here is what I have done so far:

1.  I made a local git branch based on v2.6.37.
2.  I identified commits I wanted from drm-airlied/drm-fixes (Feb. 2 2011)
3.  Because of GPU lockups recently cured by Alex Deucher I picked one particular commit first (1e644d6d drm/radeon/kms: re-emit full context state for evergreen blits) without this testing would be pointless since my GPU would just lock up when trying and 3D app.
4.  I then cherry-picked the rest of the commits I had chosen in order from oldest to newest (according to 'git log').  See attached file 'applied-cherry-picks.txt' if interested in specifics.

Everything actually seemed to be working fine I only happened to notice a small glitch.  I use a locally-built game called 'prboom-plus' with my original Ultimate DOOM WAD file to test Radeon support (in kernels Mesa xf86-video-ati etc.).  When a game begins there is a melt-down animation which transitions into the new game there is a similar (I would have guessed identical before) melting effect when the player is killed but hits the space bar to restart the game.  In this second melting effect after being killed the melted part of the screen was all black a clear regression.

Before today's testing I had been using a straight 2.6.37 kernel with the patch from Alex I mentioned in item 3 above.  With that kernel both melting effects work fine.  That seems to rule out a problem with xorg-server mesa libdrm or xf86-video-ati.

I decided to try bisecting the issue.  I built kernels from the first and last commits listed in the attached file:  1e644d6d and dca0d612.  The former was good and the latter bad.  The bisect jumped to 204663c4 and 18007401 next -- both were bad.  The next jump 65705962 caused 'prboom-plus' to hang during the second kind of melting I was able to SSH into the machine and 'kill -9' the game.

Since there was a series of TTM related changes in that series of commits I used 'git bisect skip' until I was presented with a commit before or after the TTM series I tested the kernels (all hung on the second melt) but told git to skip them the ones I pretended to skip were eba67093 95762c2b and 702adba2.  I was offered 147666fb and it was bad but did not hang during the second kind of melt.

Continuing the bisect took me back to 2357cbe5 which hung X so that it could not be killed with 'kill -9' I had to reboot via SSH.

I skipped ecf7ace9 and 68c4fa31 without building kernels.  The bisect then went to d6ea8886 and b6724405 which hung (so I pretended to skip them).  I skipped 96726fe50 without building.  The bisect moved to 3e4ea742 which hung and 6f34be50 which also hung.

Interestingly f5a80209 was perfectly OK.  This meant that the last commit I tested was the first bad commit.  I had been skipping the commits causing hangs because I expected the hang to be a temporary problem resolved somewhere in the middle of the list I believed this because of the fact the first and last commits in my list did _not_ produce hanging kernels.  Of course I was actually building most of the kernels that I skipped so I knew they were bad even if git did not.

To sum up. the first three cherry-picks (applied to v2.6.37) were fine:

  1e644d6dce366a7bae22484f60133b61ba322911
  drm/radeon/kms: re-emit full context state for evergreen blits

  27641c3f003e7f3b6585c01d8a788883603eb262
  drm/vblank: Add support for precise vblank timestamping.

  f5a8020903932624cf020dc72455a10a3e005087
  drm/kms/radeon: Add support for precise vblank timestamping.

The commit which introduced the hangs -- and these happened entirely predictably and consistently: when the second kind of melt in 'prboom-plus' occurs -- was

  6f34be50bd1bdd2ff3c955940e033a80d05f248a
  drm/radeon/kms: add pageflip ioctl support (v3)

After a series of several TTM-related commits the hanging was resolved and the second kind of melt would display in all black instead beginning at this commit:

  147666fb3b93b8c484f562da33a37f886ddff768
  drm/radeon: Use the ttm execbuf utilities


As I mentioned above these results are preliminary I will try builds directly from drm-airlied tomorrow since we are snowed-in here in Michigan and I don't have to work tomorrow.

My problems with hangs sound very similar to f.d.o. bug #33515.  This may also be related to #33418 since that user (Erdem) is using 2.6.38-rc1.

Impress template out of border

When using default templates with impress RC2 many of them have ugly edit zones.

Zones for text image diagram are out of border.

I can redesign them but it's not friendly.

The template affected in the rc02 version are :

light blue shapes

During normal Firefox usage the screen either goes black and the console freezes or an image remains and the mouse cursor is movable but nothing else responds. (I can't be very precise about the failure modes because they are being described to me remotely by a computer-phobic user.)

Anyway here is what I see in the X server log file:

----end----

Restarting the server (with Alt-SysRq-K) appears to lead to another black screen / movable mouse cursor / dead console hang with the new server log peppered with Failed to submit batch buffer messages.

There's no core dumps for these and grabbing a batchbuffer dump at one point actually horked the system completely (presumably a kernel panic as SSH no longer responded) so I'm not sure what additional information I could provide that would help track this bug down.",63,"1"

    mesa: Enables GL_RGB and GL_RGBA unsized internal formats for OpenGL ES 3.0

    GL_RGB and GL_RGBA are valid internal formats on a GLES3 profile. See
    Table 1. Unsized Internal Formats at
    https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man3/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml.

    Fixes 2 dEQP tests:
    - dEQP-GLES3.functional.state_query.internal_format.rgb_samples
    - dEQP-GLES3.functional.state_query.internal_format.rgba_samples

    Reviewed-by: Brian Paul 

This commit fixes tests where glGetInternalformativ() is used to get the number of samples supported by a particular internal format for a render buffer.  Pg 242 of the GLES 3.0.4 spec implies that GL_RGB and GL_RGBA are valid inputs to glGetInternalformativ().  However these are unsized internal formats and are not supported for render buffers according to pg 204 of the spec which states a renderbuffer's internal format must be a sized internal format....

The commit updates _mesa_base_fbo_format() to allow GL_RGB and GL_RGBA as valid render buffer internal formats.  It has the effect of enabling those formats for glGetInternalformativ() and glRenderBufferStorage()/glRenderBufferStorageMultisample().  It should have only enabled the formats for glGetInternalformativ().

"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-16448","Tajik keyboard layout: put 'щ' in place of the letter 'o' for Russian words","I'm reporting this for a Ubuntu user:

The original Tajik keyboard layout was based on using the letter 'o' for
making the extra letters. For example: typing o and then x produces Tajik h.

In the current system the letter o doesn't do anything but the Tajik
letters can be made by using RightAlt. For example RightAlt + o produces
Tajik h.

The 'o' on the keyboard is dead and does not have any function. In
Russian (the Tajik keyboard is based on the Russian keyboard) the 'o'
produces the 'щ'.

Because Russian words are often used in Tajik I would suggest putting
the 'щ' back in place of the letter 'o' so that the one keyboard layout
can be used for typing Tajik and Russian.

then

I changed the file usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/tj so that the AD09 key is
no longer dead but produces cyrillic_shcha. The changed file is
attached. When using this it is possible to type all Tajik and Russian
words on the tj keyboard without having a dead key.

Unfortunately one of gcc's extensions causes it to think there's nothing wrong
with a zero length array so this doesn't trigger an error in gcc when the
assertion is false.   To do that the array length needs to be changed from 0 
to -1 since gcc agrees that an array of negative length is indeed an error.

"MESA-101739","An issue with alpha-to-coverage handling is causing Arma 3 64-bit Linux port to render trees incorrectly","The game is sometimes rendering trees. It has multiple tree mesh models and when the tree gets close the game is switching between different LODs/models by rendering both models overlapping on a grid of pixels as if checkerboard pixels of old LOD in black fields of it new one in white.

As long as it’s doing that using single-sampled buffers as render targets all is fine. However in higher quality modes the game switches to multisampled buffers. When using multisampled buffers if ATOC is turned on in settings the game is using alpha-to-coverage technique without polygon sorting to make sure that the grass is rendered correctly. At the same time it’s using depth test and depth write to fill up the depth buffer. In the same execution of fragment shader it sets the output color and alpha value and the depth buffer value and it expects the alpha value to cause the color value to end up only in some samples of multisampled texture and - the important bit - the depth value to end up only in the corresponding samples of the depth buffer.

This technique works on DX11 on Windows on all drivers on Mac OS X and on NVidia drivers on Linux but on Mesa Radeonsi drivers on Linux it makes the rendering go bad rendering most of the tree pixels white until the LOD transition ends.

The white is visible on the screen because it is the initial color of the multisampled render target and for some reason this color is allowed to leak through which means that in some cases the depth buffer value is set when the corresponding color buffer value isn’t.

Both depth and color buffer have the same number of samples (8) and were created with fixedSamples = true in OpenGL call.

It looks as if the depth buffer values in case of Mesa Radeonsi driver were:
 - correctly not written when the depth test fails for the fragment shader
 - correctly written to all samples of the depth buffer when alpha coverage directs the draw to fill them all but
 - INCORRECTLY assigned not only to those samples to which alpha coverage directed the fragment output color but either to all the samples in depth buffer or to samples in depth buffer that don’t correspond to the samples in color attachment buffer.

We encountered the same issue in 2015 in fglrx drivers contacted AMD team about it and received confirmation that it is a bug and that it was fixed. Unfortunately shortly after that fglrx drivers went out of use.

The issue can be easily reproduced in Arma 3 by:
 - launching Arma 3 game
 - switching to High quality or higher to turn on multisampled buffers
 - enabling ATOC (alpha to coverage) in Video settings or making sure it's enabled
 - launching first level of Drawdown 2035 campaign ie. starting a new campaign bypassing optional tutorial and observing as the main character walks into the base the bushes flicker white from time to time as they get closer.

The issue is present in Mesa 17.2.0-devel from padoka PPA on at least Radeon R7 260X/360.",451,"1"

Patch that fixes this issue

Hello

I use fribidi library in BiDiTeX project --
support of Hebrew for LaTeX documents and I found
that when I work with documents in cp1255
LRM/RLM marks are not converted correctly
and the code does not work.

There is a bug in fribidi library or
more exactly in fribidi_cp1255_to_unicode_c()
and fribidi_unicode_to_cp1255_c() functions.

It does not convert LRM/RLM marks to UNICODE symbols
as required (253 254  0x200E0x200F).

The same happens in reverse direction
(unicode to cp1255)

The easiest way to reproduce the problem is following:
Take text (a א!RLM b) in utf-8
and run through fribidi you'll see a !א b as it should be
Same text encoded with cp1255 run with fribidi -c cp1255
you'll see a א! b -- incorrect one.

The patch that fixes this problem is attached
it was build against version 0.10.9

"SYSTEMD-56593","systemd-cryptsetup does not allow a hash type of plain","Running systemd-cryptsetup with hash=plain in the fifth (comma-delimited) parameter for a plain dm-crypted disk yields the error message Failed to activate: Invalid argument. 

Replacing plain with ripemd160 or another supported hash function works as expected. Removing the hash open from the list entirely just causes the default hash type to be used (in my case ripemd160). 

This contradicts the crypttab and cryptsetup man pages. crypttab defers to the cryptsetup page for supported values of hash and cryptsetup mentions (albeit closer to the bottom of the page under NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING FOR PLAIN MODE) that if 'plain' is used as argument to --hash the input data  will  not  be hashed which implies that plain is a valid option.

Indeed without supporting plain as an option any disks or partitions set up initially with cryptsetup using --key-file=/myfile.key (for plain dm-crypt and not LUKS) do not seem to be decrypt-able as cryptsetup will not apply a hash to the key in this instance but systemd-cryptsetup must apply the hash.",6,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-47369",": Function ABS is unusable in Ukrainian interface because of prohibited symbol in identifier translation","Created attachment 58520
This sheet contains only one formula in cell A1: =ABS(0). Any editing in Ukrainian interface causes #NAME error.

Problem description: 
I can not use ABS function with Ukrainian interface in LibO Calc 3.4.3...3.5.1. It is impossible to insert it to formula because of prohibited character in it's Ukrainian name.
When I try to open any document with ABS function in LibreOffice Calc with Ukrainian interface this function name Абсолютний номер has prohibited 11-th symbol - space. Any editing of cell causes #NAME error.

Steps to reproduce:
1. If You have no Ukrainian interface please download and install it from LibreOffice site:
http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/3.5.1/deb/x86_64/LibO_3.5.1_Linux_x86-64_langpack-deb_uk.tar.gz

WARNING!!!...! By installing these packages You automatically switch your language to Ukrainian! If your system have no support You may see empty menus and dialogues or bird's language! To restore English after reproducing a bug I successfully try terminal command:
   sudo apt-get remove libobasis3.5-uk*.*

2. Download and open attached AbsTest.ods.
3. If your interface is not Ukrainian switch it to Ukrainian: Tools-Options select in the left panel Language Setting-Languages and in the right panel User Interface - Ukrainian.
4. Select a cell A1. The formula is =Абсолютний номер(0)
5. Edit it and add +0 at the end of formula: =Абсолютний номер(0)+0

Current behavior:
#Name
Expected behavior:
0

6. To restore English interface use in terminal:
sudo apt-get remove libobasis3.5-uk*.*

I propose POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
1. Change internal identifier to ABS in Ukrainian language packet.
2. Correct internal identifier to remove prohibited space for example АБС АБСЗНАЧ etc.

"LIBREOFFICE-55570","autocorrect slow-down","mmmhhh... it seems that performance in LOdev 3.7 declined versus current 3.6 stable releases... so I'm REOPENING this bug.

my tests say that the freeze time after typing the first word in a Writer document become longer in LOdev 3.7

LibO 3.6.1 
--------------------
acor_.dat (65K entries)
5 seconds

acor_.dat 65K entries + acor_it-IT.dat 55K entries

master 3.7.x

acor_.dat 65K entries + acor_it-IT.dat 55K entries
20 seconds 

acor_.dat 65K entries + acor_it-IT.dat 119 entries *
26 seconds 

* this test can't be done in 3.6.1 since only master currently supports autocorrect databases larger than 65K


I suspect that the longer freeze of LOdev 3.7 is a side effect of the new 32-bit autocorrect databases introduced by this committ: 

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=78a39502de36c32d7aaf6e5bbde1f8df80fdd21f

so I'm adding Tomaz Vajngerl to the CC List since he's the man who's doing a lot of work fixing autocorrect performance issues and maybe he's could find a solution in this area he already knows very well

if you read Comment 17 and Comment 25 from Micheal Meeks you'll see that he saw room for improvement for his partial 3.5.4 fix",68,"1"
"EXEMPI-58175","exempi hardcodes Mac OS X header location","In configure.ac line 175 exempi adds the system header location to the CPPFLAGS with a hardcoded path of /Developer.

/Developer was the default path in older versions of Xcode however as of Xcode 4.3 the path has been moved inside the Xcode.app bundle which by default is installed in /Applications. You can use the OS's xcodebuild utility to determine the correct SDK path.

So the right lookup would be:

a) If /Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon exists use that
b) If not then xcodebuild can be shelled out to in order to determine the SDK path e.g.: `xcodebuild -version -sdk macosx10.7 Path`/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon

(You can determine the OS name via `sw_vers -productVersion` and shorten that to just the major OS version.)

I don't have a Snow Leopard machine in front of me but you may be able to use xcodebuild to find the path on older versions of Xcode as well.",39,"1"
"DRI-98257","[SKL] Crash while intel_fbdev_restore_mode and freeze","Hi

I observed an issue which is often reproducible but not always.

I am able to reproduce this with Ubuntu Kernel 4.7 and 4.8 using a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Tablet with additional Productivity Module and Onelink+ Docking Station. Additionally an external display has to be plugged at the Docking Station (VGA or DP happens more often with VGA)

I configured both displays (internal and external) at F7 X server console. After that I started a second X server at an other console (e.g. F1). I configured X to use both displays. Then I unplugged the external display from the docking station. After that I terminated the X Server on console F1 and switch to X Server at console F7.

After doing these steps I got a black screen and the system freezes.

At a system where debugging is much easier for me I got the following debug output in that case:

The memory protection fault occurred at 0xfefefefefefefefe. This is because grsec will overwrite all freed data with these value. So it looks like a use after free. Not using grsec this is still reproducible but not every time. But if I instrument kfree this way that I write 0x0 to the freed buffer it is always reproducible again. So I assume that in case it is working without a crash at default ubuntu the memory was not reused util the use after free.

After some debugging I found that restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked will restore the fbdev mode and access the fb_helper structure in drm_fb_helper.c. There the drm_connector was removed from fb_helper->connector_info. This is because the unplug was detected and the connected unregistered (drm_connector_unregister) and drm_fb_helper_remove_one_connector was called. Just before the restore the fbdev mode the last reference of the drm_connector was removed and the cleanup of the drm_connected was done (drm_connector_cleanup).

Inside the fb_helper->crtc_info[i].mode_set there is still a reference to this connector (was not removed during unplug). This reference is accessed during fbdev mode restore and the memory protection fault will occur.

The backtrace of this call is:

nir_lower_clip_cull_distance_arrays() marks the combined clip/cull
distance array as compact.  However when translating in from GLSL
or SPIR-V we were not marking the original float[] arrays as compact.

We should do so.  That way we can detect these corner cases properly.

I did it with the exception of the contributions from Mathew Garrett. The driver is now unmaintained and not compatible with latest X.org any more. I'd like to take over maintainership and get the driver hosted on fdo.

My plan is:
1.) Get someone to copy over the git repository from [3] to xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics (this is the thing where I need help with)
2.) Create a branch named synaptics-gpl
3.) Remove the contributions from Matthew Garrett from the master branch (yes we all know the driver will be worse)
4.) Change the license and headers to MIT.
5.) Update the build system to be compatible with the rest of the X.org tree
6.) Update the source to be compatible with latest X.org
7.) Maybe add [4] as a seperate branch.

If someone will do 1.) for me I'll step up as maintainer and integrate patches and drop releases from time to time.

That's because the client sends its real UID while the server checks the effective UID.

1/ handle_client_response_mech()

The only way to make it work again is to reboot the machine.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2011-01-03 12:22:23 +0000 ----

I wrote tests which trigger both the UnknownMethod and Request.finish called on a request after its connection was lost error and improved syncevo-http-server so that it no longer triggers these errors.

However I could not reproduce that the server got stuck without these fixes. I consider this issue resolved - until proven otherwise...

At boot selection screen is normal. When I choose default boot the splash screen comes up and looks normal for about half a second then it flashes and slightly changes color and constantly shakes from then on. Restarting X at the GDM prompt also comes back up shaking. See attached Xorg.0.log

See https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=572102 for detailed history. I have tried booting with a different make of monitor - still shakes.

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93144
But as suggested by Alexandre Demers I created a new report for i965.

Maybe the game also needs GL_ARB_stencil_texturing which is ready for Intel gen8 GPUs but not gen7 (like mine).
I write this because Shadow of Mordor also uses compute_shader but this games works great on Intel gen7 and mesa master.",1257,"1"

"POPPLER-101526","Division by zero in Stream.cc:471","Created attachment 132096
Proof of concept

There is a division by zero in Stream.cc:471. In the ImageStream constructor INT_MAX is divided by nComps parsing the attached PoC.pdf case nComps has the value 0. The division by 0 caused a SIGFPE crash

 461 ImageStream::ImageStream(Stream *strA int widthA int nCompsA int nBitsA) {
 462   int imgLineSize
 463 
 464   str = strA
 465   width = widthA

 467   nBits = nBitsA

 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {

A possible solution is to check for this case:
 471   if (nBits  INT_MAX / nBits - 7 || nComps ==0 || width > INT_MAX / nComps) {

When I want to select the file type with save as one file type in the list ist translated to Text - Verschlüsselung wählen where Verschlüsselung means Encryption which is wrong. I guess in English you will find text - choose (en)coding. So the translation is completely misleading.

Prior versions had a much better translation.

To the german translator: Der Text wird hier nicht verschlüsselt sondern man wählt die Textkodierung aus d.h. wie der Text gespeichert wird.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Save As
2. See file type list

Screenshot of the language filter list from the Add Layout dialog box

A dialog box in KDE Keyboard Layout allows to filter layouts by their language. In this list are 4 entries named simply: fr mng scr and trv (see screenshot).

fr contains:
- a duplicate of the French (Canada) layout also found under French
- a Bambara layout only available under the fr language entry despite the fact that the Bambara language is listed. Maybe the one under fr should be moved to the Bambara entry uniting the French and English layouts?

The other 3 are either wrongly labelled or incorrectly linked to the layouts they contain. Presently mng is tied to the Mongolian layout scr has Croatian and trv Taiwanese. But according to the iso-codes bug report linked below: mng is Eastern Mnong scr is a retired code for Croatian and trv is Taroko.

Since KDE and iso-codes deny being the source of this problem xkeyboard-config seems to be the only one remaining.

Tested with xkeyboard-config 2.7 and iso-codes 3.38 and 3.40.

"XORG-1330","Xv displays garbage/green when X resolution is too high (on cyberblade/i1)","My hardware: a Compaq laptop with Cyberblade/i1 and a 800x600 LCD but using an
external monitor.

With resolutions higher than 1024x768 mplayer displays any video garbaged
and/or green.
xvinfo reports that the maximum XvImage size is 1024x1024 - so maybe that's
the limit.
However I tried changing resolution on the fly with xrandr to just about any
resolution and it was still garbaged.

I also tried setting cybershadow to on display to crt only and also
tried switching to another virtual console and back to X after xrandr to maybe
reset some more registers...

I guess since xvinfo reports a 1024x1024 limit I can't use Xv with higher
resolutions but I don't know if changing to 1024x768 with xrandr should work or
not...

-----------------------
Here's some more info which can basically be ignored...
The LCD is 800x600 but I set the laptop to use the external port only (LCD is
turned off) - plus in 1024x768 Xv works ok so the 800x600 doesn't seem to be
the problem.
I tried reconfiguring the X server ended up regeneration a completely new
config file and still the problem was always the same - >1024x768 fails.
Other that Xv the X works fine with the higher resolutions (upto 1856x1392).
I tried almost every resolution possible 1280x960 1280x1024 1400x1050 (with
and without the Display1400 option) 1600x1200 1792x1344 1856x1396 - none
works. Only 1024x768 and lower works.

Also an undated version of widl (a tool in the wine project) may be needed:

xorg.conf from one-Screen configuration (corruption)

I have two R370 cards each with two 1280x1024 monitors on them. I am attempting to set up a quad-head configuration with the version of the driver at git commit b416e97a1f16ef700ba1aaca317dee82b7a3cf64 .

I have successfully tested a dual-head configuration and a quad-head configuration with two separate Screen sections. However this does not integrate well with my window manager (KDE) and I have been trying to get all the monitors as viewports on a single Screen section.

When I change the Virtual size from 2560x1024 to 5120x1024 the output on the screen becomes massively corrupted.

I also cannot move the cursor onto the third or fourth monitor (those on the second device) although the modes are initialised I suspect this is because I either haven't understood the configuration file properly or because I'm trying to do something that can't be done. However the corruption is the bug that I'm reporting.

We found an interesting line in the Xorg.log (and in the xrandr-
output):

I have no idea whether this is related to the flicker problem but
in any case - something is wrong probably an underflow and hope-
fully the driver does not try to use these values for the panel :-)

We did not have the flickering problem with the old radeon-driver
without xrandr 1.2 support.

Adobe video speed failure

System Environment
=======
OS: Linux Ubuntu 17.04 64 bits
Kernel: 4.12.0-rc3-drm-tip-ww2-commit-187376e+
X-Org: 1.19.99.1

Regression?
=======
No

Bug detailed description
=======
Embedded content derived from Adobe products plays at a high rate of speed disregarding if the video has been buffered or not it will play at high speed.

Videos have frame rate issues as they seem to get stuck momentarily (specially with the FLV/SWF formats) the higher the resolution the heavier the problem (chopped playback)

Reproduce Steps
==============
Open a video (streamed or local) from 720p resolution and up

Expected Result
=============
It should play at normal speed.

Actual Result
===========
Plays intermittently at different frame rates with a regular frame drop every one or two seconds and in the case of FLV/SWF videos it plays at a 2X - 3X playback rate when not chopped or stuck.

Analysis & Root Cause
===================
Possible and maybe required bottleneck detection within the graphics stack (even per-output port display sequencing) improper buffer usage.

It may happen due to the fact of the audio clocks being misconfigured that the video couldn't find a correct speed value to display the required amount of textures buffered however this is a totally different behavior while using x264 or other video codecs it seems to fail only with Adobe derived video content.",59,"1"

backtrace of the segfault

Due to the lack of documentation I don't really know what I'm doing but I think the following should work...

Software: Linux 3.7-rc5 libdrm from git mesa from git xorg from git (here with -O0 and -g3) xf86-video-ati from git and xf86-video-intel from git.

Hardware:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI WIMBLEDON XT [Radeon HD 7970M] (rev ff)

This is what xrandr says:

$ xrandr --listproviders
Providers: number : 2
Provider 0: id: 112 cap: 0xb Source Output Sink Output Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 8 associated providers: 0 name:Intel
Provider 1: id: 69 cap: 0xd Source Output Source Offload Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 0 associated providers: 0 name:radeon

I'm trying to set the radeon card to being the one stuff is going to be rendered with:

$ xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 69 112

Then I run

$ DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo

and X segfaults. The backtrace is attached. Please tell me if you need more variable values etc.
I'm not sure how well the HD 7970M is supported yet but glxinfo should run...

With DRI_PRIME=0 it works fine on the intel card.

Again this is the quite new AMD Enduro stuff so maybe it behaves differently than PowerXpress.",710,"1"
"POPPLER-59186","configure in poppler 0.22.0 fails to find jpeglib.h","Configuration was:

In ${HOME}/Softwaren64 I am preparing shared and static libraries etc. to build FontForge. There is also jpeg8d installed. No particle of libjpeg6b can be found.

The configure goes:

	checking for libjpeg6b... no
	checking for libjpeg... -ljpeg
	checking jpeglib.h usability... no
	checking jpeglib.h presence... no
	checking for jpeglib.h... no
	configure: WARNING:
	There is an installation error in jpeg support. You seem to have only one
	of either the headers _or_ the libraries installed. You may need to either
	provide correct --with-extra-... options or the development package of
	libjpeg6b. You can get a source package of libjpeg from http://www.ijg.org/
	Disabling JPEG support.
	
	checking libjpeg.h works correctly... ok
	checking for LIBPNG... yes
	checking for FREETYPE... yes


config.log shows that the script initially works OK:

	configure:20271: checking for libjpeg
	configure:20300: gcc -std=gnu99 -o conftest -pipe -fPIC -fno-common -Os -march=core2 -mtune=core2 -m64 -fomit-frame-pointer -msse4.2    -H -I/Users/pete/Softwaren64/include -m64 -Wl-t -Wl-dead_strip_dylibs -L/Users/pete/Softwaren64/lib conftest.c    -ljpeg -lm >&5

Therefore it finds the library. But for the C header file it forgets the -I/Users/pete/Softwaren64/include (complete CPPFLAGS) so it can't it:

most Kurdish speakers know only one writing system.

xkb currently has a keyboard layout for writing the Latin-based Kurmanji dialect
spoken in Syria and Turkey (see Bug 6159).  However it needs a keyboard layout
for the Sorani dialect of Kurdish which is spoken in Iran and Iraq and uses a
modified Arabic alphabet.  The existing Arabic and Farsi xkb layouts are not
appropriate for writing Sorani Kurdish.

Let me repeat: I have Lenovo Thinkpad Z61t WITH TV-Output. This quirk should be removed or tailored to X60. It's better to show non-connected output than disable perfectly working output.

"FREEDESKTOP.ORG-16265","Hook permissions on new git repos","The post-update hook needs to be chmod +x to ensure that the repo can be
cloned or fetched over http for those who use that access method.

(Read the git-update-server-info(1) man page for details.)

On annarchy this:

: find /git/ -name post-update \! -perm -111 -ls

finds 42 repos which need that fix.  

After the hooks are fixed git-update-server-info should be run in each
of the affected repos.

This will of course have to be done on kemper.

The procedure for adding a repo should set the +x perm when the repo is
created or copied over.

(A quick test on my box shows that doing the chmod on the hooks in the templates dir does indeed propagate to repos subsequently git-init(1)ed.  I suspect any such change will have to be redone after any apt-get upgrade which upgrades git....)

I don't know how often http is used for fdo repos.  As an example there
are only 31 repos accessible via http://people.fd.o but at least 230
available via git://people.fd.o.  And about a third of those 31 won't
work over http because they need a git-update-server-info.

But there has been some chatter about failing http clones on the lists
so it seems at least some people use it at least some of the time.

I have two radeonhd cards: primary (integrated rs780) and secondary (rv710).
I can get both cards working in the same time with the single Xserver configuration but when i use multiseat configuration (each card have their own Xserver) the secondary card is failing to initialize.

From the corresponding Xorg.log file i see:

On my desktop the details were only slightly different: when pin 0 didn't pan out the kernel moved on to pin 1 (i915 gmbus ssc) which led to the same failure mode on the first try.  In contrast 2.6.38 on my desktop reported eight attempts on each of pin 0 and pin 6 after which it moved on with no further messages from the DRM subsystem.  (I haven't tested with older kernel versions on my laptop should I?)

"MESA-43520","CoreBreach: Static lighting broken in Mesa 7.11","Created attachment 54112
Screenshot of bug

Static lightning is broken in the game CoreBreach. This happens with all the drivers I have tried so it's probably a general Mesa problem.

This is not a problem on git master. I bisected to find the commit which fixed this problem hoping it could be cherry picked for the next stable release:

commit 719909698c67c287a393d2380278e7b7495ae018
Author: Ian Romanick 
Date:   Tue Oct 18 16:01:49 2011 -0700

    mesa: Rewrite the way uniforms are tracked and handled
    
Considering the size of the change it seems unlikely to be suitable for this. Maybe someone could have a look at this and see if a smaller fix is possible for 7.11?

Author:     Juan A. Suarez Romero 
glsl/linker: link-error using the same name in unnamed block and outside

According with OpenGL GLSL 4.20 spec section 4.3.9 page 57:

   It is a link-time error if any particular shader interface
    contains:
      - two different blocks each having no instance name and each
        having a member of the same name or
      - a variable outside a block and a block with no instance name
        where the variable has the same name as a member in the block.

This means that it is a link error if for example we have a vertex
shader with the following definition.

  layout(location=0) uniform Data { float a float b }

and a fragment shader with:

  uniform float a

As in both cases we refer to both uniforms as a and thus using
glGetUniformLocation() wouldn't know which one we mean.

This fixes KHR-GL*.shaders.uniform_block.common.name_matching.

I plugged in Logitech MX 1000 mouse. Xorg server does not distinguish
some of its buttons. xev shows button numbers up to 5 - the side
buttons do not work. There is a discussion here:
http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wfsection/print.php?articleid=46.
I tried the approach described there (writing 12 buttons and other
options into xorg.conf) - but found that protocol evdev is not
supported.

xorg server would need ability to work with evdev Protocol directly
(there are some patches mentioned on that page).

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Plug in Logitech MX 1000 mouse (USB port)
2. Configure xorg.conf to use 12 buttons 
3. xmodmap -e pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4 5

    mesa: Add error checking in _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() for MRTs
    
    This patch adds required error checking in _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() when
    blitting to multiple color render targets. It also fixes a case when
    blitting to a framebuffer with renderbuffer/texture attached to
    GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT{i} (where i!=0). Earlier it skips color blitting if
    nothing is found attached to GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0.
    
    V2: Fixed a case when number of draw buffer attachments are zero.
    V3: Do compatible_color_datatypes() and compatible_resolve_formats()
        check for all the draw renderbuffers in fbobject.c. Fix debug code
        at bottom of _mesa_BlitFramebuffer() to handle MRTs. Combine error
        checking code for linear blits with other color blit error checking.

I'm using only DRI_PRIME=1 GALLIUM_HUD=fpsVRAM-usage+GTT-usage. I have not tested much different combinations.

I haven't tested that much applications because it has a good chance of a hard lockup of the whole machine. But often it recovers after killing the application with the HUD.

With the Unreal Engine Cave Effects demo I think I can reproduce it every time and in fact it is immediately visible whether it will work (when changing mesa versions) because when it works immediately a black window with the HUD is visible until the demo loads and when it won't work a few fat white garbage lines will be visible in the window or something like that.

I only tried glxgears as another application a few times and sometimes it worked and sometimes it produced the lockup.

"XDG-APP-91164","User xdg filesystem sharing broken","When you try to share one of the xdg directories rather than the entire home directory the user-dirs.dirs file is not respected and applications don't use the proper directory. Here's what happens.

1. A temporary user-dirs.dirs file is written to /tmp and told to be mounted by the helper at ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs.

2. The runner then overrides XDG_CACHE_HOME XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME to point to the app's data directory ~/.var/app/$app/{cacheconfigdata}.

3. Inside the sandbox the app queries for one of the xdg directories. E.g. g_get_user_special_dir (G_USER_DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS).

4. Since XDG_CONFIG_HOME is ~/.var/app/$app/config the custom user-dirs.dirs file won't be found at ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs.

5. This will fallback to $XDG_DATA_HOME/Documents (using the documents example above). Since XDG_DATA_HOME is ~/.var/app/$app/data and not just $HOME you'll get an empty directory instead of the bind mounted ~/Documents.",0,"0"

let me know if more could help.

i have tried lots of things with evdev fdi files and xorg.conf but i have found no solution on the .conf side.
i believe the issue could be 64bit related because it also occurs with a livecd of sabayon for x86_64 (Sabayon_Linux_5.1-r1_amd64_K.iso) whereas it does not occur with the x86 edition (Sabayon_Linux_5.1-r1_x86_K.iso)
i'm able to recompile anything as long as it is the same versions as the current gentoo ebuilds i'd be glad to help by testing a patch or provide more specific traces if needed.",171,"1"

"XORG-56591","[SNA] Xorg crashes with SNA Kicad","Created attachment 69325
Xorg log of crash

My X crashes every time I try to open the module editor from the Kicad suite's pcbnew layout editor.
I have narrowed the problem down to SNA. I recompiled the xf86-video-intel driver with both SNA and UXA support (I'm on Funtoo so USE flags sna and uxa enabled).
When I change the AccelMethod to SNA my X crashes immediately when I try to launch the module editor.
When I change the AccelMethod to UXA the module editor launches correctly. So I'm forced to use UXA for now if I want to use Kicad.

I'm using these commands to compile Kicad version 2011-07-08 from sources:

Possible solutions for MC 5's use case:

* Change the spec to document MC 5's behaviour overruling my objection

* (API break) make UpdateParameters return a boolean reconnect required and let the client do the reconnect when it wants to - consider adding a Reconnect method too. libmcclient's method to update parameters could be patched to call Reconnect whenever necessary keeping its C API unchanged

* Add a new parameter-updating method paralleling UpdateParameters that has one of the above behaviours

Currently tests/dbus/protocol-objects assumes that echo does not export protocol objects but echo-2 (aka echo-message-parts) does.

Since the original Text-only echo CM is no longer exemplary (everyone with Text should ideally implement Messages) I suggest moving it from examples/ into tests/lib/ and re-namespacing accordingly.",21,"0"

Add new Latvian keyboard layouts

I've added Dvorak Dvorak programmers and Colemak US compatible layouts to Latvian keyboard mapping.

I reformatted layout file since it had spaces and tabs all mixed also I improved readability and added few variants to layouts (like y-key variant for Dvorak)

The y-key variant for Dvorak seams like good idea to me because in Latvian we don't use y (unless someone writes Latgalian dialect) and it's easily reachable with strong pointing finger.",2,"0"

stefan@laptop ~/src/mesa/src/mesa/drivers/dri/r200 $ glxgears

etc etc etc

There are no visible rendering bugs in glxgears but in other apps many vertex program and ATI_fragment_programs do not work correctly(The commit above made the extensions show up as expected). Do these messages indicate that something deeper is wrong or are they just spam? The failing shaders include the DolphinVS.exe dx8 sdk sample when run with Wine the Bumpmap samples and vertex blend sample. I think the directx8 sdk is not publically available any more but I can try to write stand alone test apps to show these bugs if needed. (Wine uses GL_ATI_fragment_shader on r200 cards for fixed function fragment processing)

The error messages do not show up in mesa master and the extensions work correctly.",15,"0"

Upon switching from next-20160615 to next-20160617
I noticed that moving the cursor randomly causes its movement to jitter in a lag-behind/catch-up fashion (most noticeable when dragging windows as this applies the effect to the whole window thus causing it not to move fluently).

Upon some bisecting I have found that this is caused by the following commit in linux-next:

ee042aa40b66d18d465206845b0752c6a617ba3f - drm/i915: Use atomic commits for legacy page_flips

Upon reverting this commit the issue is no longer present.

Another intriguing fact is that in some applications (ex. Games) which bind the mouse input - the movement is fine.

presentation file to reproduce with

After opening a .pptx file and copying some slides to a new presentation LibreOffice crashed on starting the slide show. I have attached a minimal file that can be used to reproduce the issue.

My system:
64-bit Arch Linux with LibreOffice 4.2.2.1. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the attached presentation file.
2. Go to the slide sorter and copy the slides to clipboard.
3. Open a new empty presentation and paste the slides to the end of the slide sorter giving you 3 slides total.
4. Start presenting. (for me in the mode that shows both the current and next slide on the screen)
5. Go to the next slide. 

What should happen:
Libreoffice should show the next slide and the slide after that (with text) in the next-slide-box.

What happens:
Libreoffice keeps the next-slide-box empty and shows a message-box with title LibreOffice 4.2 - Fatal Error and no content except for the exception icon. On pressing OK it completely terminates. 

Running with --backtrace:
I got no interesting output just:

Full Xorg.0.log (gziped)

This bug is a follow up to #54808.

I'm still using Fedora 17 on a notebook with an ivb GT2 and I'm still using that old cairo version 1.10.2 (sorry). Again it is not possible to view the large NASA picture (http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20120705a/PIA15689_Greeley_Pan_wDeck_L257F.jpg) using eog but now I'm getting a new error message in Xorg.0.log:

__kgem_bo_map__gtt: failed to retrieve GTT offset for handle=54: 7

The handle number differs from time to time. The full Xorg.0.log is attached.

I tested ver. 2.20.10 of the driver and the latest version from git (66eb0adff...) and got the same result.

Viewing the picture worked perfectly after bug #54808 was fixed. I'm not sure what update since then led to the problem. I got a new kernel (3.6.6 instead of 3.5.3) but I can reproduce the issue with kernel 3.3.4 (unfortunately I don't have 3.5.3 anymore) so it's unlikely that kernel 3.6 causes the trouble.

I'd be glad to help tracking down the problem but if the old cairo version causes the trouble and you say it's no longer supported that's also fine for me.",1,"0"

"COLORD-48637","colord somehow seems to keep /dev/mapper/foo busy","This problem comes from a downstream bug report:

https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5337


Basically the problem is that the user in question as an encrypted partition which he unlocks during his user login. If the partition is unlocked when colord starts the fact that colord is running actually prevents him from running luksClose with a Device or Resource Busy (note that the encrypted drive is already unmounted by this stage it's purely the tidying up of the encrypted volume that's failing).

Killing colord allows the operation to succeed.

Note this only happens if colord is started *after* the partition is unlocked (i.e. dbus activated by the user login). If it's started earlier (either manually or by a different (i.e. test) user logging in first before the encrypted partition is unlocked) then there is no problem.


Now I'm pretty certainly that colord itself is not playing with /dev/mapper/* or /dev/dm* stuff but perhaps it's doing something that could interfere somehow? I don't know maybe inotify stuff that somehow misbehaves or some external library that is doing weird things? Figured you'd be the best person to ask for advice at the very least! I did have a quick scan through the code but nothing jumped out at me.

Note that cupsd also seems to be doing similar things so this could have the same root cause or simply have similar problems.",2,"0"

Synopsis: Crashes when trying to fill in text
Bugzilla-Product: evince
Bugzilla-Component: general
Bugzilla-Version: 0.4.x
BugBuddy-GnomeVersion: 2.0 (2.10.1)
Description:
Description of the crash:
My credit card company sends me statements. There's a little text box
for me to fill in for how much I'm paying on my bill. When I tried to
click there evince crashed. The PDF is from Chase FYI.

Steps to reproduce the crash:
1. Open PDF from CC company
2. Try to fill in Amount Enclosed
3. Crash!

Expected Results:
CC company receives money and stops hounding me for more.

How often does this happen?
Very rarely I'm poor.

Additional Information:
Even though they say I need Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.1 can I use this as
an excuse for not paying my bill and get some kind of deference? -)

From those 195 symbols 107 can not be found in the header files i.e. they are private.
Please consider hiding those private symbols.
A simple approach could be to use libtools symbols regex [1] like

and then name the private symbols _xkl_*

I've included _xkl_debug as it seems to be exported in the API even if the name suggests otherwise.

    nir: Remove fake edges in the CF handling code
   
    When NIR was first introduced Connor added this fake-edge hack to work
    around issues related to unreachable blocks.  Thanks to GLSL IR's jump
    lowering code the only unreachable code you can have is a block after an
    infinite loop.  With SPIR-V we didn't have the jump lowering code so we
    could also end up with the if (...) { break } else { continue } case
    which generates an unreachable block after the if.  Because of this most
    of NIR had to be fixed up for handling unreachable blocks.  The only
    remaining case of not handling unreachable blocks was specifically the
    block-after-infinite-loop case in dead_cf which was fixed by the previous
    commit.  We can now delete the fake edge hack.

This introduces a workaround in gen9_init_workarounds which is also
conditional on

https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/281077

[Problem]
Xdmx crashed with SIGSEGV in dmxCreateGC() when running an Xdmx server under Xephyr while running xdmx version 1.5.1-1ubuntu2


[Original Report]
Xdmx crashed with SIGSEGV in dmxCreateGC()
running version 1.5.1-1ubuntu2

How to reproduce:
* start an Xephyr server
* start an Xdmx server. which connects to the Xephyr server

What happend: Xdmx throws a segfault
What I expected: Xdmx should not throw a segfault

There is already a patch in the master branch of xorg-xserver:
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=6f1d5147cb394b7c83c4c1447c78890fa2b40a45

But with this one I get an strange behavior when I just want to move the mouse in Xephyr:
...
[mi] EQ overflowing. The server is probably stuck in an infinite loop.
[mi] mieqEnequeue: out-of-order valuator event dropping.
...

If I connect an xterm to the Xdmx server I get a segfault in miPaintWindow.

By creating a public repo (rather than a private repo) I can get the other HAL developers to upload new and updated content and also have a nice shiny URL that isn't a people page.

This doesn't belong in hal or hal-info git trees as it is just a website in html and javascript not code or XML and is not a logical part of either HAL or hal-info.

I guess a suitable project name would be hal-quirk-site. I would like to stay primary contact for this project and I will get the other developers to open account modifiaction requests once this is set up.

I would like git and a url but do not need a mailing list as we can use the hal mailing list for that. Many thanks!

The other way downloading it and trying to open it locally also works. There it

when libdbus byteswaps a message into native order it doesn't alter byte 0 of the fixed header (the byte order). Normally this is harmless but if you're going to forward the message to another connection (e.g. you are dbus-daemon) badness occurs.

If someone had opened a bug back in 2007 this might have been fixed by now. Or maybe not.

Drop duplicate Malay (Jawi) entry

The fix of  added the Indonesian (Jawi) keyboard layout via the symbols file id. Two additional symbols files - my and bn - where added which both load the just mentioned layout and they both have the name Malay (Jawi).

The list of input sources includes:

Indonesian (Jawi)
Malay (Jawi)
Malay (Jawi)

One of the Malay (Jawi) items is apparently redundant so I'd suggest that the bn symbols file is dropped.

Besides being redundant the presence of the bn symbols file confuses the ibus-avro tool for typing Bangla/Bengali please see . While the latter is probably a bug in ibus-avro dropping the duplicate entry in xkb-data serves the purpose of working around that conflict for now.",13,"0"

  Working with vim and elinks in text console mode the only thing that can bring me out of that breamfish-subsistence is probably a proper downgrade of X to the openSUSE`s standard update repo (where 3d accelaration crashes). The remarkable thing about it is that everything goes on as normal - the background music continues to play and the mouse continues to move.

There are also similar compile errors in lx_driver.c. and cimarron.c.

This has been compiled on Linux AMD64. Geode is an AMD 32 bit processor the code uses unsigned long for pointers (32 bit on Geode but 64 bit on AMD64) but makes assignments to int or 32 bit registers.

I assume it's a video driver (integrated graphics) that is not expected to work on anything but Geode. From my readings AMD announced no further development on Geode so it is unlikely there will be a 64-bit version.

The proposed solution is to build the geode driver on i686 architecture CPUs only. The command 'uname -m' for Geode returns i686. I'll provide a patch for this solution but I'll be happy to implement a patch for another solution.

"XORG-25615","xdpyinfo returns wrong screen size","same as Bug 20409 just for radeon.:

> xdpyinfo | egrep resolution|dimension
  dimensions:    3840x1200 pixels (555x350 millimeters)
  resolution:    176x87 dots per inch
This is very nasty since programs like KWord which rely on xdpyinfo do not work
at all.

        DisplaySize  370 230
        DisplaySize  555 350

xdpyinfo should perhaps return the dpi value for the primary screen featuring
555x350mm:
3.4 x 3.4 dpmm =  87 x 87 dpi  (555 350)
5.1 x 5.2 dpmm = 132 x 133 dpi (370 230)

Consequently I would expect the following output:
> xdpyinfo | egrep resolution
  resolution:    87x87 dots per inch
and not:

"XORG-19398","Black screen when VGA is rotated","I'm testing the beta versions and I'm having trouble with a dual screen setup when the VGA output is rotated. It used to work fine with intel 2.5.3 .

Two screens non rotated works fine:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate normal --output VGA --preferred --right-of LVDS --rotate normal
Rotation of LVDS works fine:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate left
Rotation of VGA is accepted by the server but leads to a black VGA screen or VGA screen with some parts of the LVDS screen:
xrandr --output LVDS --rotate normal --output VGA --rotate left
(same problem when both displays are rotated)

I've tried to play with the transform option but it didn't lead to any success (and the option is not documented at all so it's not so easy to use).

I don't know how related it is but in addition xrandr reports an effective size of 1200x1921 instead of the expected 1200x1920.

"DRI-108981","Kernel 4.19 won't boot with amdgpu (black screen) for some video cards","I'm running into a major issue which seems to have been introduced with Kernel 4.19.1 and later (did not occur in 4.18.5). My OS is openSUSE Tumbleweed x64 with the last working snapshot being 20181112.

My machine refuses to boot and remains stuck at a black screen after issuing the boot command in grub2. The HDD led flashes a few times shortly after grub2 disappears but after that it will stay off and nothing new happens. I cannot use control + alt + fN to switch to a different runlevel either however I'm still able to toggle the NumLock / CapsLock leds which means the system isn't freezing up entirely. The computer won't respond to the power button and has to be restarted via the reset button.

The issue is specific to the amdgpu module: Kernel 4.19 will boot successfully if using the radeon and not amdgpu driver. I'm able to load it after removing the following parameters from my Kernel command line:

radeon.si_support=0 radeon.cik_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 amdgpu.cik_support=1

I can confirm that the problem is video card specific: My mother's computer also uses openSUSE Tumbleweed and has the latest snapshot as well as the same kernel parameters for amdgpu. For her there are absolutely no issues when booting with 4.19. I'm pondering whether this Kernel introduces an issue in amdgpu which affects GCN 2.0 video cards explicitly.

My affected video card is a Radeon R9 390 8GB (GCN 2.0). My mother's working video card is a Radeon R7 370 2GB (GCN 1.0).",2,"0"

OpenSUSE 10.3 (7.2) did not suffer from this problem.

This was filed as novell bugzilla 469878 and they asked me to file the bug here
instead.

I will make a series of attachments shortly of various config files and such
altough I think what is stated below is the primary issue:


I have a Dell Optiplex 745 with the integrated Intel graphics.
I have a ADD2 card installed that makes a 2nd DVI-attached monitor available
to the integrated graphics.

This unit has the Q965 Intel chipset.

The monitors are both Dell flat panels DVI-connected model 2007FP

In opensuse 10.3 I have a nice dual-head setup that works fine.

I was unable to use opensuse11.0 because it would hang whenever X11 started up.

In opensuse11.1 X11 is able to start but my 2nd panel has nothing on it.
So I'm back to trusty opensuse 10.3 for now.

I have found that xrandr doesn't even see my 2nd monitor any more.  There
should be a TMDS-2 in here.  So no wonder sax2 can't configure dual-head:

I've got problems with mail merge and faxsimile on libreoffice 3.5.4 kubuntu 12.04 and debian wheezy libreoffice 3.5.4 also.

I've created an spreadsheet file like this

Name    Number
TEST1   0815
TEST2   0816

and save it as TESTFAX.ods

Thereafter I created an FAX.odt file in which I inserted a new database TESTFAX.ods menu->insert->Fields-> Tab Database -> Add database file -> Browse...

After that I selected the Mail merge fields  and  and inserted them into the text like this:

  @@#@@

Then pressing  for print and selected Yes for form letter.

In Mail Merge I selected all and get the Print Dialog where I selected the printer faxprinter (installed via spadmin and working with single file). There I went to Tab Options an selected 'Create single print job for collated output' and 'Use only paper tray from printer preferences' also either of them.

As result I received each number 0815 and 0816 received one file with two pages containing the whole merge mail. Till openoffice 3.2.1 (last used version on debian squeeze aka UCD 3.0) you selected in Dialog Mail Merge 'print single jobs' and each job was splitted into the different numbers where I wanted to send them.

I'm quit confused because the same description stand inside the documentation.

"MODEMMANAGER-102231","MBIM modem failing with MaxActivatedContexts after suspend/resume cycle","Aleksander and I discussed this on IRC but I'm logging a bug too to make sure it doesn't get forgotten about.

My HP lt4120 modem (in MBIM mode) will after a suspend/resume cycle no longer be able to connect:

[root@sloth ~]# mmcli -m 28 --simple-connect=apn=telenor.smart
error: couldn't connect the modem: 'GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.libmbim.Error.Status.MaxActivatedContexts: MaxActivatedContexts'

The modem was in all likelihood connected when the machine was suspended (as the WWAN connection in NM has connection.autoconnect: yes).

Even though the modem isn't connected from MM/NM's point of view from the MBIM point of view it appears to be:

[root@sloth ~]# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --query-connection-state
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Connection status:
              Session ID: '0'

            Context type: 'internet'
           Network error: 'unknown'

I can bring it back to life by using mbimcli to disconnect it:

[root@sloth ~]# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --disconnect
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Successfully disconnected
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Connection status:

[root@sloth ~]# mmcli -m 28 --simple-connect=apn=telenor.smart

It would be nice if MM gains the ability to do this on its own at suspend or resume time (or both).

"XORG-27430","distorted display with Dell U2711 monitor with xserver-xorg-video-ati","Created attachment 34624
lspci -vvnn output

Gets distorted display with a Dell U2711 using the KMS enabled xorg server that comes with Ubuntu Lucid (10.04).

The distortion is such that fonts are rendered almost unreadable (beside that the outline is distorted they have a heavy red tint to them). It seems like that everything gets overlayed with a kind of sawtooth like pattern which distort everyhing including fonts borders on windows and edges in images and such.

The distortion is not present in screenshots.

The distortion seems to be there all the way from boot and up. That is the ubuntu logo with progress bar displayed during boot also displays the same distortion.

When using a different monitor that is a Dell 2005FPW monitor the distortion is all gone. (The U2711 uses dual channel DVI - 2560x1440 resolution while the 2005FPW monitor uses single channel - 1680x1050 resoultion.)

The ATI fglrx driver (ver. 2:8.721-0ubuntu7) works fine with the U2711 monitor (but calculates the DPI wrong - gets 96 while it should be 109 for this monitor).

The videocard is a Radeon HD 4550 card (RV710 chip).

Have tested with the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver that comes with Ubuntu Lucid the driver from ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa (ver. 1:6.12.192+git20100401.6baa96c4-0ubuntu0sarvatt) and with bleeding edge (buildt according to instructions given at http://www.x.org/wiki/radeonBuildHowTo).

From the general discussion around such issues and the KernelModeSettings found on the net I have gotten the understanding that parts of the Xorg driver code now resides in the kernel and it could therefore be that the problem resides there and not in the xserver-xorg-video-ati/radeon driver. Have used the standard kernel (currently 2.6.32-19) that comes with Ubuntu Lucid all the way as I have not found out how to update the KMS parts in the kernel with newer versions (pointers are most welcome). Tried with a 2.6.33 kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.33/ but this kernel gave no change (is from february and the KMS part might therefore not be up to date).",204,"1"
"MESA-10529","Incorrect lighting/clipping in Neverwinter Nights","Eversince xorg-server 1.2.0 and Mesa 6.5.2 (both requirements of xorg-x11 7.2) I have a strange issue with Neverwinter Nights (native Linux client version - patched to latest).

The issue is hard to explain but I will try. If someone wants a screenshot I can forward. Basically it looks like the gamma correction is off (everything has a bright glow). However if I zoom in (camera changes) then the image begins to appear correct. It's almost as if the 3D engine isn't properly setting/reading the correct coordinates for lighting and camera or something.

As well the field of view for objects in the distance seems to be clipped too close rather than being in the distance. 

To verify this is not related to xf86-video-intel driver or xorg-server 1.2.0 I have tried various versions of both and no change. However if I keep latest intel driver latest xorg-server and downgrade mesa to 6.5.1 the problem goes away (when it loads the i915_dri.so from Mesa 6.5.1). 

I have tried the latest GIT versions of Mesa xorg-server x11-drm intel agp for kernel and the intel video driver. No luck in correcting the problem.

Also when using all GIT versions with i915tex_dri.so enabled Neverwinter Nights loads but none of the text appears in the main menu and some of the grapics/images do no show or are partially loaded/cut off.

Can anyone help determine what is broken here? Something changed from 6.5.1 -> 6.5.(2|3).",49,"1"

glsl: Copy function out to temp if we don't directly ref a variable

Otherwise we can end up with IR that looks like this:

    (
      (declare (temporary ) vec4 f@8)
      (assign  (xyzw) (var_ref f@8)  (var_ref f) )
      (call f16  ((swiz y (var_ref f@8) )))

      (assign  (xyzw) (var_ref f)  (var_ref f@8) )
    ))

When we really need:

      (declare (temporary ) float inout_tmp)
      (assign  (x) (var_ref inout_tmp)  (swiz y (var_ref f) ))
      (call f16  ((var_ref inout_tmp) ))

      (assign  (y) (var_ref f)  (swiz y (swiz xxxx (var_ref inout_tmp) )))
      (declare (temporary ) void void_var)

The GLSL IR function inlining code seemed to produce correct code
even without this but we need the correct IR for GLSL IR -> NIR to
be able to understand whats going on.",3,"0"

Dmesg

Hello

I am testing the new dpm code on my RV730 card:
$ lspci -v
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV730/M96 [Mobility Radeon HD 4650/5165] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
	Subsystem: COMPAL Electronics Inc Device 003e
	Flags: bus master fast devsel latency 0 IRQ 50
	Memory at d0000000 (32-bit prefetchable) [size=256M]
	I/O ports at 2000 [size=256]
	Memory at cfef0000 (32-bit non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
	[virtual] Expansion ROM at cfe00000 [disabled] [size=128K]
	Capabilities: 
	Kernel driver in use: radeon

The screen constantly flickers everytime I interact with the computer like moving the mouse og touching the keyboard. If I don't interact the computer the flickering is alot less. If I boot without radeon.dpm=1 the flicker dissapears.

The flickering is best descripted as if the screen is jumping up and down very fast.

Using the latest ucode for my card:
- R700_rlc.bin
- RV730_smc.bin
- RV730_pfp.bin

"XORG-18259","Xorg 7.4 with xfs breaks GTK+ 1.2 applications such as Xdialog","We have discovered that Xorg 7.4 does not work correctly when using xfs. For example the GTK+ 1.2 function gdk_string_extent() returns a zero width with a font that normally works. This problem is visible with the Xdialog application which crashes with Floating point exception on startup. Here's how to reproduce this on Fedora 9:

* Install xorg-x11-xfs and start it. 
* Install xdialog. 
* In the X session run Xdialog-gtk1 and verify that you can see the help screen. 
* Change the fontpath to use xfs: xset fp= unix/:7100
* Run Xdialog-gtk1 which now crashes with Floating point exception. 

All updates installed. We have also been able to verify this problem with our own Xvnc compiled with the Xorg 7.4 sources against xfs running on Fedora Core 6. The problem has also been verified on the latest Fedora Rawhide. 

I've also been able to verify the problem with the GTK+ calendar demo application located in /usr/share/doc/gtk+-devel-1.2.10/examples/calendar on F9.",224,"1"

Picture of an artifact

Hi

There are some black shaped artifacts occuring over window on gnome-shell.
I managed to record a video and extract an image displaying such an artifact.

This bug is not deterministic however it is very frequent : to make it appears I only moved a terminal window on the bottom edge of the screen.

Note that this bug is not specific to gnome-shell it also appears on kwin effect in kde and in others circumstance in gnome-shell but the scenario described above is the easiest to reproduce.

My hardware is AMD Zacate E350 (evergreen based) using Mesa 7.11 rc1 (bug is also in 7.10.x) on opensuse 11.4 64bits(is also on Fedora 15) with r600g drivers libdrm 2.4.26 and ati ddx 14.2 kernel 2.6.39.

roster/groups: don't rely on an implementation detail

Before telepathy-glib 0.20.3 and 0.21.1 we had this incorrect sequence
(pseudocode) for each group:

* NewChannels(the group)
* GroupsChanged([the group] added: [...] removed: [])
* NewChannels(the group)

In 0.20.3 and 0.20.1 we removed the second emission of NewChannels
(Bug #52011). Unfortunately that broke this test which was specifically
expecting GroupsChanged followed by NewChannels.

Rather than reversing the assumption I'm doing it properly by
expecting the events in no particular order.",0,"0"

add hash check for outlines section numbers

If the definition of an outlines section in a document is broken and /Next references contain a loop libpoppler will follow this blindly and become stuck in a loop of its own.

The broken documents I found had sections arranged like:
24 /First 25 ... /Type/Outlines
25 /Next 51 ...
27 /Next 28 ...
28 /Next 52 ...
29 /Next 27 ...
30 /Next 29 ...
...
50 /Next 49 ...
51 /Next 50 ...
52 /Next 51 ...

I assume that the same bug could be triggered with just two Outlines sections.

Attached is a patch that fixes this issue but I have no experience with the workflow and coding practises of the poppler project so it may not suit the authors.

This issue applies to v0.8.7 and earlier.  The patch is valid for this version and also applies cleanly to 0.5.9

The patch works by adding a hash of outline section numbers visited.  If a number appears again the loop is exited.",119,"1"

The rows pasted in are a different height than the current rows so they take up more room however the rows that haven't been pasted into don't move down. They are only redrawn on a page down/page up.

Expected behavior:
The rows below those that have expanded should move down.

i.e. the man page suggests to use 0. But on 64 bit platforms 0 and 
NULL are not the same therefore this causes problems and often 
crashes. I noticed this because mlterm used 0 instead of NULL in this 
function like written in the man page which made mlterm crash often 
on x86_64. To fix these crashes I only had to replace 0 -> NULL.

    The fact that we flush denorms to zero breaks our half-float
    conversion and blending. This patches enables denorms for
    blending. It's a little tricky due to the llvm bug that makes
    it incorrectly reorder the mxcsr intrinsics:

Note the parent_dev=0x00000000 part -- this causes net_add to immediately fail:
        if (parent_dev == NULL)
                goto error

I think a possible work-around for this (at least for vlan interfaces) would be to find the parent based on MAC address.  This is arguable a problem with kernel sysfs tree:

"POPPLER-80093","does not render ligatures for TeX Gyre Termes font anymore","Dear poppler devs

I'd like to bring an issue between poppler and the TeX Gyre Hermes fonts to your attention. The TeX Gyre fonts are high-quality replacements for the Base35 Ghostscripts fonts and are thus prefered by fontconfig for text rendering. TeX Gyre Hermes is the replacement for Times in this set.

However there is one issue with the OTF font files of that fonf: They have their fi fl etc. ligature glyphs named f_i f_l etc. This leads to the situation that these glyphs are not recognized by poppler anymore and texts set in Times and rendered with TeX Gyre Hermes contain white spaces where the ligatures should be.

This was reported to work well with previous versions of poppler (around 0.18) but does not with recent versions so it should be considered a regression. The issue has been reported to the Debian bug tracker here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742767

and has been discussed on the fontconfig bug tracker here:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73291

until the fontconfig devs found that issue would be solved by kicking the TeX Gyre Hermes font out of the list of valid replacements for Times. :/

I'd like to ask you to change poppler to be more tolerant and accept the glyphs called f_i f_l etc. as aliases for fi and fl etc. They are valid ligatures glyphs.

Thank you very much!

"XORG-987","XV viewport effect with multiple heads with different resolutions","Hi 
 
Apologies if this is in the wrong category I couldn't find anything xv specific so I picked on the driver 
instead. 
 
I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 with on board ATI Mobility 7500 graphics.  Works great with the radeon 
driver using DRM but xv overlays won't expand to full screen when outputting to my external 
monitor at 1280x1024. 
 
It's very difficult to describe...the video -appears- to be stretching to the full screen but I get a kind of 
viewport effect where I get a box (I am guessing its 1024x768 in size roughly) and if I move the 
box around I can move the viewport and see parts of the movie that are hidden. 
 
If the movie isn't full screen and I have say xine at the top of the screen and I move the mouse to 
the bottom of the screen some of the video that's playing is hidden. 
 
If you can tell me how to do screenshots of overlayed stuff I'll show you what I mean...I hope I've 
described it properly.

After putting the laptop into sleep to disk and resuming got some corruption of the display. In updated areas of windows. Mainly the top window bar popup menus and changed text. After 10 minutes it disappeared on its own and is now working correctly. Looking in the logs I see these two messages. The first one was during the resume of the kernel and the second was when the corruption stopped.

Hi

I frequently use OFFSET in Insert > Name > Define for create Drop down lists.

The array formula =OFFSET(A1001COUNTA(A1:H1)) returns Error 504 with LibO Beta2.

May be it's a collateral damage of the resolution of this bug : http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=103331

PDF exposing the issue

Forwarding https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=748257

SUSE Manager API Documentation showing display problems in evince okular and xpdf

How to proceed:

1. Start okular evince or xpdf.
2. Open the attached PDF in the reader
3. Browse through the PDF and you will see:
   a. Three pages which belong to the table of contents
   b. A chapter Sample Scripts
   c. A chapter Frequently Asked Questions
   d. A chapter Namespaces 1: activationkey
   e. The table of contents continued

The pages b c and d must not be there. The table of contents is interrupted
by these pages. This is obviously wrong. Interestingly everything else is
fine.

As all three applications share the common library libpoppler it should be
very likely this is the piece to blame. :)

However when viewed with Adobe Acrobat reader or GhostScript (gs) the PDF is
correctly displayed.

Another issue maybe related: When starting evince or xpdf on the command line
they give the following error message:

Error: Missing 'endstream'


Addendum:

Process the PDF with pdfjam (package texlive-bin):

 $ pdfjam book_susemanager_apidoc.pdf  --outfile good.pdf

After this treatment the PDF seems to be healed and can be viewed by evince
okular and xpdf again.

However this is NOT the solution! It's just a workaround.",9,"0"

"LIBREOFFICE-36950","Installation breaks 64-bit Windows Search of ODF files","Overview: Installing LibO causes text of all ODF files subsequently saved in LibO or OOo to be invisible in Windows Search in 64-bit versions of Windows.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Originally install OpenOffice.org in a 64-bit version of Windows.
2) Create/edit a file in any ODF format in OOo.
3) Close the document saving on exit.
4) Use Windows search to successfully find the ODF file from words in the text of the document.
5) Leave OOo installed.

Steps 1-5 are optional but demonstrate that Windows search finds text in ODF documents with OOo installed.

6) Install LibO in the 64-bit version of Windows.
7) Create/edit a file in any ODF format in either LibO or OOo.
8) Close the document saving on exit.
9) Search for words in the text of the ODF document using Windows search. The ODF document will not appear in search results.

Actual Results:
Installation of LibO prevents any ODF document saved on closing from being found in Windows search results both in LibO and OOo.

[Note: Saving an ODF document in LibO or OOo during editing rather than at closing does not trigger Windows to index the file so the previous index state persists. This may be considered a separate bug.]

Expected Results:
The ODF document appears in Windows search results for a search on any words exisiting in the text of the document.

Build and Platform:
LibO 3.3.2 release Windows 7 64-bit SP1 also reported on Windows Vista 64-bit.

Additional Information:
The attached file contains a report on errors in the Windows Registry with OOo 3.3.0 plus  by LibO 3.3.2 installed in that sequence.

The following 3 files are missing from the LibO installation:
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\shlxthdl_x64.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\ooofilt_x64.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\propertyhdl_x64.dll

Files of these names are present in the equivalent OpenOffice.org 3 folder. However note that the following 32-bit files differ from the files of the same names in the equivalent OpenOffice.org folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\shlxthdl.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\ooofilt.dll
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3\Basis\program\shlxthdl\propertyhdl.dll

It is the installation of LibO that breaks the OpenDocument Format Filter registry key  which previously pointed to the OOo version of ooofilt_x64.dll and points it to the missing file in the LibO installation instead. This file is necessary for Windows to index ODF files. There are other errors as listed in the attached file.

Particular SVG picture showing the regression and screenshots

Problem description: 

As of version 4.1.1 (possibly earlier) SVG picture Background - Gray.svg found in attached zip archive is not displayed correctly when inserted in LO Writer document.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the Front_page.odt document found in attached zip archive.

Current behavior:

In version 4.1.1 of LO Writer the picture is displayed in color instead of light gray. The light gray version of the picture was done by coloring colored version of the picture in light gray using Inkscape. As a result of that light gray color was defined explicitly in style= but the original color was left defined in class=. Here is an example from attached SVG:

<circle
   ...
   style=fill:#e8e8e8fill-opacity:1
   ....
   class=fil24
/>

where class fil24 is defined as:

.fil24 {fill:#2F6864}

In attached zip archive you will find screenshots of the document displayed in LO Writer version 4.0.5 and 4.1.1. It seems that class= is taking precedence over style= so picture is displayed colored instead of light gray.

The SVG picture is displayed correctly (light gray) in version 4.1.1 of LO Draw so only Writer is affected

Expected behavior:

Attached SVG picture should be displayed light gray.

"DRI-104195","[i915] [Device 591b] Backlight not working - wake from suspend not turning on monitor.","Hello.

i have a Thinkpad T470-P which is equipped with Intel HD graphics 630

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 591b (rev 04)

I tried upgrading graphics drivers with intel graphics update tool 2.06: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-update-tool-linux-os-v2.0.6

But it caused waking up from suspend to not work seems the screen is not enabled 

Also the adjusting of the backlight stops working. 

/sys/class/backlight is empty. Default there was a link to intel_backlight after playing with kernel option parameter backlight= set to vendor i get a link to lenovo_backlight but it does not work.



Backround info:

I have installed Kubuntu 17.04 It works almost fine out of the box.

The size of everything on the screen was very small so i scaled it to 1.1 in KDE settings. Increased fonts sizes and forced DPI to 120.

I have a big issue with text getting corrupt complete rows get messed up  most problem in Qtcreator but also noticed it in Konsole.

kernel module loaded for the graphics card is i915.

Xorg is default using fbdevhw when booting stock kernel and with kernel 4.14.4-041404.
 it is using modesetting driver with submodule fb.

I tried changing font changing font settings like anti aliasing sub pixel rendering e.t.c. without any luck.

I tried upgrading the kernel to 4.14.4-041404 upgrading the bios. 

So what needs to be done?

What is the correct setup? i.e:
    -which kernel module and version to use for intel HD graphics 630?
    - Any special kernel option parameter to set during boot?
    - which Xorg driver to use ?
    - Any special Xorg config options?
    - Any special KDE settings for fonts e.t.c. ?


Thank you.

I've seen the issue happen with basically any data source.
The test case I prepared is based on a simple (legacy) VTK data
file ('fakehurr_merid.vtk') generated by a Fortran program
('gen_fakehurr.f').

  $ tar xzf mayavi2-interpolation-bug-test.tar.gz
  $ ls
  fakehurr_merid.vtk  gen_fakehurr.f  mayavi2-interpolation-bug-test.tar.gz
  $ mayavi2 -d fakehurr_merid.vtk

The main window shows up with a data source already loaded.

 * for menus select Visualize -> Modules -> Surface
 * in the MayaVi pane double-click on Surface
 * in the dialog window check Interpolate scalars before mapping
 * click on the OK button

A nice visualization is shown with very smooth colored areas.

 * in the TVTK Scene 1 pane click on the Obtain an isometric view button

There's an area on the left where the interpolation seems to produce
a strange fake transparency effect (as shown in the attached PNG image).
Disabling the interpolation makes this defect vanish (but produces a
less convincing visualization).

Dmesg output from boot

Video output fails completely (apparently due to a KMS regression) on all kernels >= 3.2 rendering the system unusable as a desktop. Access via SSH over network is unaffected.

Steps to reproduce: Boot any recent kernel. This has been encountered with Debian and the kernel versions in question are:-

linux-image-3.0.0-2-amd64         3.0.0-5               functions as expected
linux-image-3.2.0-1-amd64         3.2.7-1               fails
linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64         3.2.13-1              fails
linux-image-3.3.0-trunk-amd64     3.3-1~experimental.1  fails


Expected behaviour:-

At system boot initial kernel output appears on the VGA console until the drm driver is loaded when the kernel switches the output font and resolution. Boot continues until a subsequent switch (I believe when the kernel attempts to modeswitch the card) at which point the font visibly changes at this point and boot continues with further console output until the X desktop appears.

Actual behaviour with failing kernels:-

Boot starts normally until the modeswitch happens at which point video output ceases and the monitor shows no signal on the DVI input.

Graphics hardware details from lspci is:-

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI R480 [Radeon X850XT (PCIE)] (Primary)
01:00.1 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI R480 [Radeon X850XT (PCIE)] (Secondary)

"XORG-29046","[G45] Blank/corrupted windows then GPU hang -- garbage in the batchbuffer","Created attachment 36995
Display corruption - elongated font or sometimes just vertical lines.

After a few non-fatal display issues (attachment: corruptBeforeCrash.png) the whole screen goes blank except for a single underscore in the upper left-hand corner (presumably it's a cursor in a character display mode).  After 2.5 seconds the mouse pointer appears in the center. A half-second later I can move the mouse. After 4 seconds (total) I sometimes see a flicker of what looks like startup messages (attachment: flashAfterCrash.jpg - this was very hard to capture).  Then the screen blanks and the process repeats with the single solid underscore in the upper-left-hand corner for 2.5 seconds.

I'm not sure if this is an issue with the intel video driver or DRI or what.

This problem only occurs under 64-bit linux. Under 32-bit I was able to see a very little corruption here and there but no crash.  I think this is a display issue more than a 64-bit issue but in 32-bits it doesn't seem to crash.


System environment: 
-- chipset: Intel G45
-- system architecture: x86_64
-- xf86-video-intel: ?? 
-- xserver: 
-- mesa: 7.7.1 ???
-- libdrm:
-- kernel: 2.6.32-23-generic
-- Linux distribution: Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit
-- Machine or mobo model: SuperMicro C2SEA
-- Display connector: VGA


Reproducing steps:

Open firefox.
Go to gmail
Begin typing a message
Grab lower-left corner of window and drag rapidly and randomly
First notice disply corruption then total blank screen a few seconds later.

Alternately:
Similar with gnome-terminal or gimp.  Type or something that changes the screen inside the application then wiggle lower-left corner of window (resizing it) until it crashes.  Should only take a few seconds.

Problem occurs with NO xorg.conf.  Creating an xorg.conf using Xorg -configure and adding the following to the Device section fixes the problem entirely:

Option DRI False

"XORG-3369","RADEON doesn't unblank DPMS on shutdown","The Radeon chipset exhibits a strange behavior on shutdown: 
- When the DPMS registers were programmed such that the screen was blanked at 
  startup the screen remains blank after the server is shut down - no matter what   
  the state was while X was running.
- When the text console was not blank prior to the start of X but X was in a DPMS  
  power save mode when it was shut down the screen remains blank in console mode.

This exhibits two problems:
- Mode pragramming seems to be 'asymetric'
- DPMS powersave state isn't disabled during shutdown.

The patch that is going to be attached does two things:
1. It fixes the asymetry in register programming.
2. It disables any power save state prior to server shutdown regardless of the
   text console state.
The second step may be debateable as we don't restore DPMS to the state it was
in before X was started on the other hand a visible text console seems to be
what most people want.",0,"0"

When trying to connect to a ssh server running dualstack (both ipv4 and

and Ipv6 recovers if I kill the routing daemon (bird).

xf86-video-ati from git as of 2010.10.07 also has this problem.
xf86-video-ati-6.13.1 is OK.

Sorry I do not have time to do a git bisect right now although I may try at some point if nobody beats me to it.  In the meantime I figure I should still report the bug now.

When I try to set dual link mode (2560x1600) in xf86-video-ati-6.13.2 or the git version as of 2010 Oct. 7 I get what appears to be a bad video signal.  Either the whole panel will display a rapidly changing or flickering image that looks somewhat similar to analog television static or the left side of the panel will display this and the right side of the panel will display a blurry image of the frame buffer that I can still use.

This problem occurs with user level mode setting.  With kernel mode setting the X server comes up solid black and the server log repeatedly says Timeout trying to update memory controller settings followed by You will probably crash now... but that too will be a separate bug report.  I mention it here just indicate the just run kernel mode setting is unlikely to work for users with a configuration like mine although I think that fixing the kernel mode setting issue and then saying just run kernel mode setting might be sufficient solution for other Linux users (although I am not sure about where that would leave users of other kernels such as *BSD).

I have notebook Macbook Pro with linux on board it works perfectly except some small issues. One issue related to keyboard. That is default keys map is not so good.

You can check how Macbook Pro keyboard look like:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1220

As normal usage i prefer to have several keys map. I prefer to switch 'Left Alt' key with 'Left Windows Key' (Super_L) map small enter key (KPEN) with 'Delete' key and either Eject to Print key.

Here the list:
- Super_L to Alt_L
- Alt_L to Super_L
- KP_Enter to Delete
- Eject to Print

First two rules can be done easily by using Layout options in gnome-keyboard-property application.

For two last rules i made my own Layout options. I map enter to delete key with no problems. But when i made rules for Eject key it wont work.

When i press Eject key it appear as Print key in xev application. My gnome keyboard shortcut set to run print screen application. But when i press eject key on my workspace noting happens.

I also tried to map other key to check if it my fault or not. When i map KP_Enter to Print key everything works fine. But when i map Eject to Print noting going to work.

In my opinion here bug in X11 but i do not know where it is.

"XORG-2390","MSE_MAXBUTTONS too small","MSE_MAXBUTTONS is defined as 12 in xf86OSmouse.h

On Linux the evdev protocol supports mice with up to 16 buttons which with
zaxis mapping means MSE_MAXBUTTONS should be at least 20.

Example: my Logitech MediaPlay has 13 physical buttons and a scroll wheel.

As far as I can tell changing MSE_MAXBUTTONS to up to 31 should be OK as the
mouse driver holds a button bit map in an int but there might be other
dependencies I don't know about.

add a systemd service

upower should install a systemd service file and add a SystemdService= line to
its dbus-activated service.

By doing that it will be started by systemd instead of dbus.
This has the advantage that it will be treated like any other system daemon and
put in its own cgroup by systemd. Also its state can be checked and it can
easily be restarted or stopped if it might misbehave.

On systems without systemd dbus will start the daemon itself just like it
does now.

Attached is a patch that implements this behaviour.
Like most other packages that support systemd it adds a
--with-systemdsystemunitdir switch to configure.
Installation of the systemd service file can also be disabled using this

Steps to reproduce:
1. take numbers (x y) and plot them.
2. plot the trend line ans let libreoffice show the correlation coefficient (correct)
3. let the trend line go through zero or another value and get strange R^2's.

Current behavior:

R^2 can be bigger than 1 if the correlation gets worse.

Expected behavior:

R^2 is defined as a value between 0 and 1. If the correlation gets worse the vlaue should become smaller.

Note: I have this issue on a gentoo-box (Thinkpad X1 2012-edition) with version upower-0.99.1-r1 (r1 means I have aplied the patches from bug https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82925)

How can I be of help with further debugging of this problem? Is there a way to log things happening when battery enters critical state? Recompile with additional flags etc?",998,"1"

Kernel config for EFI boot

On my macbook 13 (late 2009 61) with a GeForce 9400M (0x0ac180b1) when booting nouveaufb kicks in and displays a garbled screen. Mostly black some greenish lines some very unreadable text.

Interestingly that only happens when I use the Macbook's native EFI mode (i.e. *without* BIOS emulation).
If I use the BIOS emulation then nouveau works.

Typing blindly I extracted the dmesg output from an EFI boot:

openarena freezes X after several minutes of singleplayer gameplay. It rarely happens right at the start but most often after half a map or one and a half maps. The screen becomes completely unresponsive and the sound loops in a subsecond loop but background processes keep working and openarena doesn't use excessive cpu. It happens in full screen and windowed mode. During play graphics are flawless.

Switching to other tty's doesn't show any change on the screen but it is possible to ssh into the box and use top or kill processes. It just doesn't show any change on screen.
When starting openarena from a terminal window it will only show bot chat but no error messages get displayed during crash.
sudo reboot initiates reboot with a system beep (but no screen change) and ssh gets disconnected after some hdd activity but shutdown doesn't finish.
Alt+Print+[REISUB] works to reboot the machine. After Alt+Print+R the game texture colors become partly inverted.

This freeze has occured on this machine on several seperate installations since (myth/K/u)buntu 8.10 x86_64 and hasn't changed with any update to

To reproduce just play around with two keyboards (in my setup one PS2 and other USB I don't have two USBs to test). It doesn't happen if the evdev driver is not installed.

Here is what I get:

1. When I connect the second keyboard (a USB one) X sometimes crashes and sometimes generates spurious mouse events (middle button click mouse-move)
2. If the xserver survives when I remove the USB keyboard it crashes imediately.
3. It doesn't start with the two keyboards connected (SIGSEGV)

Below is the output from the server when in debug mode plus a backtrace of the crash when starting it. I'll also attach the Xorg.0.log file.

between commit Use render node for DRI3 if available and glamor: Return NullPixmap on failure to create shareable pixmap something broke mpv's OGL output. I can bisect that if needed.

When I run -vo vdpau it works fine but -vo opengl or -vo opengl-hq gives me no video in the window and error lines such as:

[vo/opengl-hq] after creating framebuffer texture: OpenGL error INVALID_OPERATION.
[vo/opengl-hq] after rendering: OpenGL error INVALID_OPERATION.

and on quitting:
[vo/opengl-hq/vdpau-glx] Before uninitializing OpenGL interop: OpenGL error INVALID_OPERATION.

Rolling back to commit Set RADEON_GEM_NO_CPU_ACCESS flag for BOs which don't need CPU access fixes it.

I see nothing in dmesg related.
Other OGL programs seem to still run fine (I tried glxgears and dolphin-emu quickly) so I am not sure.

I am on Linux 4.5 mesa git Xorg 1.18.2 using a 280X.
I tried using mpv from latest git in case but it didn't change anything from 0.16.

"POPPLER-40076","Use PostScript patterns in tilingPatternFill","tilingPatternFill in PSOutputDev uses Type 3 fonts to output a PDF tiling pattern. This is fine for PS Level 1 but for PS Level 2 or higher it is more optimal to use PostScript patterns.

One problem with using Type 3 fonts for PDF tiling patterns is if the PS is converted back to PDF some PDF viewers (including acroead) do not display the patterns.

"DRI-19170","compiz w/ 3D effects causes Intel GM45 hang in drm module","Created attachment 21289
X server log file

Overview:
If I enable 3D in the server and run compiz (this is Fedora 10 but running the latest git X / dri / drm / mesa) with 3D effects enabled I get rather frequent (but not deterministically reproducible) hangs of the X server. They usually happen when switching applications or desktops.

Steps to reproduce:
Run X server with compiz / 3D effects enabled and keep switching between desktops and applications. It sometimes takes quite a while to trigger sometimes it happens within maybe 20 minutes of working on the system.

Actual Result:
X server crashes but the system stays responsive. I can log in remotely kill the X server and gdm will gladly start a new instance for me (but I tend to lose text consoles in that process)

Expected result:
X server doesn't crash?

pdf file to trigger the error message

I am using Okular and poppler both from today's git master to show a simple pdf file generated by LibreOffice.  Valgrind gives me a Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) error.  The error occurs in the method Object::free() so this may be caused by the recent better_object merger.

full backtrace in savageWriteRGBASpan_565()

The drawpix demo draws pixels spread around the screen instead of inside the window. Each line drawn (194 pixels) get displayed in a cluster but not as a line. Only every 6th line get displayed starting from the lower right of the screen going left then up (see drawpix-many.png).

The cluster is divided in 4 squares of 8 times 8 pixels where the first and fourth square is not complete. Each square is drawn from left to right then from top to bottom. Square are drawn from left to right within a cluster. (See drawpix-line.png).

I have tracked the drawing in mesa down to where it writes each pixel into the renderbuffer in savageWriteRGBASpan_565() see the full backtrace in write_rgba-backtrace.gdb.

This is with latest git. I think I have seen similar corruption using the antspotlight screensaver since a long time ago and I never tried drawpix before so this can be an old bug. The bug reporter of the downstream Ubuntu bug says drawpix worked fine in Ubuntu 8.04 which had mesa 7.0.3.",177,"1"

However I can't find the words quoted in the present EGL_KHR_create_context spec. On the other hand it allows creating debug context in OpenGL ES (i.e. setting EGL_CONTEXT_OPENGL_DEBUG_BIT_KHR in EGL_CONTEXT_FLAGS_KHR).

Should we just remove the non-OpenGL check or just allow EGL_CONTEXT_OPENGL_DEBUG_BIT_KHR in OpenGL ES context?",104,"1"

"DEJAVU-97081","Condensed variants of DejaVu Sans and Serif no longer work","Last week my Debian system upgraded the DejaVu font packages from version 2.35-1 to 2.36-1. Afterwards I noticed that in LibreOffice any text using Dejavu Sans Condensed had become invisible as if it was white text on a white background (which it wasn't). The same applies to Dejavu Serif Condensed. All other fonts are working fine.

This might be a bug in LibreOffice which was upgraded at the same time. However I don't think that's the case because I tried to type some text in GIMP using both DejaVu Sans (Book) and DejaVu Sans Condensed and the latter didn't seem condensed at all. Instead both fonts looked identical. I also found out that in Mousepad's font selector window not only Sans Condensed but also its Oblique Bold and Bold Oblique variants appeared identical to Sans Book.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start LibreOffice Writer or Calc.
2. Select Dejavu Sans Condensed or Serif Condensed. Type some text.
3. What happens is that the cursor moves on the page but no text appears.

I'll be happy to provide more information as needed.

"XORG-15481","Nouveau on nVidia Corporation G71 [GeForce 7950 GT]: works but lockup for 6 min at shutdown","Created attachment 15870
glxinfo output

Yesterday I've extracted everything related to nouveau from git repositories. That is:
       1) drm
       2) xf86-video-nouveau
       3) mesa (in a second step see below)

Build everything made the drm and nouveau module auto load at startup then changed my xorg.conf (attached).

Immediately I did see huge 2D performance improvement but noticed running glxgears that 3D was not there. Confirmed by the message in Xorg.log.0 about AIGLX. I then started to add

Section ServerFlags
        Option AIGLX on
EndSection

But when restarting X the machine hang for quite a long time. It is not dead as I can ping it or event ssh to it. But you do not have any keyboard input (even caps lock led).

I then decided to be adventurous and try the 3D. And managed to install it. I now have some basic 3D acceleration except that if I magnify Glxgears it gets a sigsegv.

But the not fatal hang for 6 min at shutdown remains. The last message I see before it really starts printing garbled init 0 message again is the failed to idle channel 1 before destroy. Prepare for strangeness.",1331,"1"

Test to get to this point:

* boot PC - (Grub screen brightness is normal)
* Set kernel value amdgpu.dc=1 and proceed with 4.16.0+ kernel boot - (kernel switches quiet and splash removed brightness appears normal during boot process)
* Lightdm display manager starts (brightness is still normal)
* Log in to any window manager When X starts the desktop is immediately darkened with what appears to be a high contrast setting. Looks like equivalent to manual setting I can't actually discern. It's not brightness necessarily but the net effect on the desktop is that everything is effectively darker.
* I've tested this with Ubuntu's Unity desktop and gnome-flashback (compiz and metacity) and it behaves the same.



When amdgpu.dc=0 is set desktop appears a normal level of brightness when logging in. It appears from the Xorg.0.log that the AMDGPU module isn't used for X but brightness isn't affected.

This only effects Writer. Calc works without issue. I have enabled autsoscroll in options and I cannot middle click to autoscroll. Other applications in the LO suite and other applications like Firefox work without issue. I'm on Ubuntu 13.10 using the supplied builds from https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa to run into this issue. It would also be helpful if people using 4.2 on Windows and those using official Linux builds from the LO website tested this. To see if the issue is specific to Ubuntu or Linux or if it affects every platform. 
Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable autoscroll via Tools > Options > LibreOffice > View > Mouse and set Middle Mouse button to Automatic Scrolling
2. Click OK.
3. Try middle clicking on a document in Writer and see if autoscroll works. In my case it doesn't.

    drm/i915/vlv: reset VLV media force wake request register

    Media force wake get hangs the machine when the system is booted without
    displays attached. The assumption is that (at least some versions of)
    the firmware has skipped some initialization in that case.

    request register in addition to the render one to avoid hangs.

    tests: Use igt macros more

    Often just folding together of the common if (cond) printf
    abort|igt_skip|igt_fail pattern. But in a few cases I've ripped out
    more since the igt macros will already print the condition and errno.

    A few tests where more work (like ripping out return codes en masse)
    is needed left as-is.

    auxiliary/vl: rework the build of the VL code
    
    Rather than shoving all the VL code for non-VL targets increasing
    their size just split it out and use it when needed. This gives us
    the side effect of building vl_winsys_dri.c once dropping a few
    automake warnings and reducing the size of the dri modules as below
    
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename

    5508486  187100  391240 6086826  5ce0aa after/nouveau_dri.so
    
    The above data is for a nouveau + swrast + kms_swrast 'megadriver'.
    
    v2: Do not include the vl sources in the auxiliary library.
    v3: Rebase. Add nine.

"LIBREOFFICE-33484","Printing multiple files from Windows Explorer at once makes LibreOffice unusable","I was hoping that this bug got resolved in LibreOffice and since it still appears in 3.3.0 release I decided to re-file the bug in LibreOffice BugTracker (not sure if bugs from OpenOffice.org are investigated automatically).

This bug reflects OOo bug ID 113476: 

The problem has been described on the forums already. See here:

and here:


Always when multiple documents (no matter if spreadsheet or word processor files) are selected then right-clicked and print is chosen then only one document is printed. The Windows task manager will show then as many soffice.bin and soffice.exe processes as documents selected. For example  selecting 3 documents and trying to print them will open 6 processes (3x soffice.bin and 3x soffice.exe). All hanging indefinitely.

There is no LibreOffice window shown at all and processes seem to refuse shutdown signals when the user tries to log off so even logoff and shutdown is blocked. Users not familiar with the task manager will be unable to close down all processes manually in order to be able to continue working. While in this state (any soffice.bin and/or soffice.exe process running) it is impossible to open up any other LibreOffice application.

This is especially annoying if the user clicked many documents (e.g. clicking 30 documents will create 60 processes which have to be killed individually via task manager).

How to reproduce:
1. Create any ODF document
2. Create two copies of the document
3. Select all three ODF documents
4. Right-click the documents selected and chose print from the context-menu
5. Open Task Manager to see 6 soffice.bin/soffice.exe processes running

I guess it might be related to the instance detection feature of LibreOffice but I was unable to disable it (allowing multiple instances).

Work-around:
No clean work-around known to me.
I was trying to create a send-to script called print in OOo.cmd which passes all parameters to soffice.exe -p %*. Unfortunately then a limit of Microsoft applies which limits the number of arguments to 20. So printing more than 20 documents in one batch is impossible (my customer wants to print about 35). Moreover if one already tried the right-click->print action then even the send-to trick will not work any more due to already blocking soffice.bin/soffice.exe processes. Asking an inexperienced user to reboot will not work either since the PC will hang at reboot :-( so the only way is to ask for a system reset which is dangerous to do without clean shutdown.

The patch closing Bug #63310 (git commit 7cfebce15228c88ee122edb8ba575f9a609e36f4) appears to be broken on platforms that use filename extensions for linked executables. As of cairo-1.14.0 the strings test hardcodes the AC_LINK_IFELSE executable name as conftest which is correct for linux and osx but mingw it would be conftest.exe instead. Using conftest$ac_exeext is probably the platform-independent way of getting it correct.

"FONTCONFIG-17014","Excessive number of allocations during FcSortWalk()","Created attachment 18161
Reduce number of allocations during FcSortWalk

The current behaviour of FcSortWalk() is to create a new FcCharSet on
each iteration that is the union of the previous iteration with the next
FcCharSet in the font set. This causes the existing FcCharSet to be
reproduced in its entirety and then allocates fresh leaves for the new
FcCharSet. In essence the number of allocations is quadratic wrt the
number of fonts required.

By introducing a new method for merging a new FcCharSet with an existing
one we can change the behaviour to be effectively linear with the number
of fonts - allocating no more leaves than necessary to cover all the
fonts in the set.

For example profiling 'gedit UTF-8-demo.txt'
    Allocator		    nAllocs	    nBytes
Before:
    FcCharSetFindLeafCreate 62886	    2012352
    FcCharSetPutLeaf        9361	    11441108
After:
    FcCharSetFindLeafCreate 1940	    62080
    FcCharSetPutLeaf        281		    190336

The savings are even more significant for applications like firefox-3.0b5
which need to switch between large number of fonts.
Before:
    FcCharSetFindLeafCreate 4461192	    142758144

The gfx card should be under PCI:01:00:0 but it is not found.

Scanpci does not find the AGP bus so xorg cannot run the driver for it. I tried it
both with a geforce2_NV15 and a radeon_rv280. Xorg fails with an error like no
devices found in Xorg.log.

Both cards work with their respective framebuffer drivers nvidiafb and radeonfb

Maybe if xorg/scanpci uses the linux facility to scan the PCI busses it would work.
In another Bugzilla bug (cannot find the number related to pci scanning on MS

maybe this could be the options i am searching for are they supported in the
standard xorg release? Is there documentation?

So to sum up:

cards run under WindowsXP
cards run under kernel framebuffer
xorg/scanpci fails to find cards but worked before the described incident

Any suggestions?

---- Additional Comments From matthijs@stdin.nl 2010-09-07 02:50:51 +0000 ----

The initial error itself seems to be triggered by not having gnome-keyring running or installed btw.



---- Additional Comments From patrick.ohly@intel.com 2010-09-07 03:16:08 +0000 ----

Currently the --keyring option only applies to the syncevolution command line tool. The syncevo-dbus-server implements GNOME keyring access differently and doesn't check the --keyring=no parameter. As a workaround use --daemon=no
which defaults to --keyring=no.

I think that the --keyring parameter should be honored by the syncevo-dbus-server
we haven't seen the need for that so far but this issue clearly shows that there is such a need.

I also considered whether the daemon should fall back to not using the keyring automatically if unavailable but I rejected that idea because falling back to a less safe alternative without explicit consent by the user seems inappropriate.

When using Dell Vostro 320 with openSUSE 11.2 and sometimes 11.4 system randomly locks up.

Desktop does not use any 3d functionality it's a windowmaker desktop with qt4 application (ran locally or through x11 forwarding over ssh) libreoffice rdp client and sometimes a webbrowser with flash. Regardless of kernel version (2.6.32 from 11.2 updates or vanilla 3.5.0 from external repository) i quite frequently encounter gpu hang messages in dmesg. 

Desktop does not respond remotely system is operational (ssh etc). X restart is not enough to restore operation of the system and full reboot is required.

I traced the error to this function :
void intelWaitIrq(struct intel_context *intel int seq)
in this file : src/mesa/drivers/i915/intel_ioctl.c

There it calls drmCommandWrite in this file:
libdrm/xf86drm.c

"DRI-90355","DRI_PRIME+radeon+steam=problems + crash","I'm using ubuntu 15.04 on a thinkpad s440 laptop.

This laptop uses a Intel Haswel card and a AMD HD8670M and i'm the distro default mesa driver (10.5.2)

i' doing this to enable DRI_PRIME support:

xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink radeon Intel
xcompmgr &
DRI_PRIME=1 steam

please note that i'm using fluxbox and if i don't enble xcompmgr i don't seen anthing (DRI_PRIME=1 glxgears will only show up a empty windows where with xcompmgr i can see the glxgears running)

So first problem is this i require xcompmgr to enable DRI_PRIME. Also check this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1430888

If not dupe i can open a new bug for this problem.

Anyway main problem...

"MESA-104119","radv: OpBitFieldInsert produces 0 with a loop counter for Insert","Created attachment 135980
test application that reproduces the bug

On RADV the SPIR-V OpBitFieldInsert opcode produces 0 when the Insert parameter derives from a variable used as a loop counter. For example the following GLSL compute shader writes 0 to the first 8 elements of the buffer at binding 0:

#version 450 core
layout(local_size_x = 1 local_size_y = 1 local_size_z = 1) in
layout (std430 set = 0 binding = 0)
	restrict writeonly buffer u2_cs { uint u2[] }

void main()
{
	for (int i = 0 i < 8 i++)
		u2[i] = bitfieldInsert(0 i 16 2)
}


I've attached a program that reproduces the bug.

I'm using the LLVM release_50 branch at revision 318947 and the Mesa master branch at 20d37da597653201d2c524434907e817bd03b1d0.",2,"0"

This seemed to appear a few days ago after updating the obiaf ppa on Ubuntu 18. I did not have this problem before.

Basically any time certain programs are fullscreen the screen becomes corrupted and looks like a corrupted version of the login background however everything is still intractable and (I'm using Gnome) pressing the super key allows me to view the application and kill it. 
The view within (Whatever the application window thing is called) works and I can see the loading animations the start menu and everything which is how I have managed to get a few applications out of fullscreen and they work fine when not in fullscreen.

Attempting to screenshot the problem doesn't seem to work. LightDM also has this issue the screen looks the exact same with even the same colors. glxinfo is also attached. Not too sure what other information I need to include?

"XORG-22229","Incorrect PLL values selected for RS690","I have had some problems with flickering using this chip and high resolution displays over DVI/HDMI. The problem seems dependent on the model of screen some seem more sensitive to variations in pixel clock than others. I have managed to resolve the issue by making 2 changes to radeon_crtc.c one to enable the use of the fractional fb divider and secondly by changing the selection criteria for PLL values to choose the closest frequency that is less than the target frequency rather than just the closest. I have added these changes unconditionally to the driver (it's basically a quick hack to make it work and certainly could be much tidier) but can post a patch if required.

I don't have access to any other radeon cards so I can't say if this problem or the solution affects them - I suspect from the looking at the commit logs that the fractional fb div doesn't work on some cards but it seems to be required for the RS690. 

Any advice on how/where to properly incorporate these changes into the driver would be appreciated.",0,"0"

analysis_and_PoC

## Summary
pdfunite util in poppler-0.55.0 will crash when parsing a crafted pdf file because the program fall into a recursive and interactive call of two functions and eventually exhaust the stack space.


## Reproduce
pengjiaqi@ubuntu:~/Documents/crash/poppler-0.55.0ild-gcc/utils$ ./pdfunite PoC.pdf 1.pdf
Segmentation fault


## Analysis
Due to the analysis is a little complex I have uploaded it as an attachment along with a PoC. In order to avoid disclosing it before patch is released I have encrypted it. The developers can communicate with me to get the password.

- game runs in Wine virtual desktop with resolution smaller than native (=> not in fullscreen)

Taking away focus from fullscreen game makes it run but taking focus back freezes it again. This can be repeated with consistent results.

"SHARED-MIME-INFO-15810","Some Thunderbird and Evolution saved emails not properly recognized","1) When you save emails from Thunderbird's 'sentbox' they're not recognized as emails but as text/plain. But messages saved in Thunderbird from any other folder than 'sent' are seen as message/rfc822 which is IMHO the correct MIME type.

Is that a Thunderbird bug or a too strict pattern in fd.o.xml?

2) Evolution saved messages always appear as application/mbox.

Regarding the message saved from 'sentbox' in TB and an Evo message the difference is apparently that Evolution adds a 'From' and date line at the top of the file and it appears as application/mbox. 

Same question: is it normal that the Evo messages are detected as mailboxes and not messages? To me finally only the TB messages not from 'sentbox' look correct or properly detected.

Thanks

"XORG-19874","R600+EXA: infinite loop when starting application in KDE","This is very similar to bug #19693 just a few differences.

I use openSUSE 11.1 which by default comes with 2.6.27.7 and X Server 1.5.2 (I
didn't change kernel or X). Manually I installed:
1) xf86-video-radeonhd from git from r6xx-r7xx-support branch
(656edee0e177f...)
2) drm.ko from git from r6xx-r7xx-support branch (ba4e9f6397c630...)
3) radeon.ko from git from r6xx-r7xx-support branch (ba4e9f6397c630...)

Again I made tests using:
Option       AccelMethod exa
Option       DRI

This time I can start plain X with xterm and run SMplayer without hanging system. There are some small EXA corruptions (lacking letters + opened menu isn't displayed until I hover all it's positions) but generally it works.

I can start KDE 3.5 but there it's worse. Just after starting I see many corruptions (some black letters instead of white and many weird-color rectangles hovering icons and quite always starting from top left) and I can not start any application. When I try to start SMplayer or Konsole system hangs.

From: Joerg Sonnenberger 
To: xorg_security@x.org
Subject: Off-by-one in libXfont-1.3.1

Hi
the update from libXfont-1.3.0 to 1.3.1 changed catalogue.c to
NUL-terminate the buffer passed to readlink. This is not correct if
readlink writes exactly sizeof dest bytes as it writes exactly one byte
after the limit. The old code was not vulnerable as it copied to a newly
allocated buffer of the right size.

This code should be somewhat reorganised to use asprintf/snprintf and
making it a lot more readable but that is a visual matter independent
of the actual issue.",0,"0"

If table contains thousands of string then standart filter works to very slow in LibreOffice-3.3.0 and LibreOffice-3.3.1.

1. Open attached file qwedasr.ods (this file was sent me by another man) 
2. choose second row val and aplay standart filter (Data -> Filter -> Standart Filter) by setting [val < -500]. Note that it takes about few seconds (on my system it's about 3 seconds [amd phenom II X4 955 (3.2 GHz) 4GB ram]).
3. Now (or you can do it first instead of item 2 of descrition) select the same row val and aplay standart filter (Data -> Filter -> Standart Filter) by setting [val > -100]. Note that time of filtering takes few second again (on my system it's about 7-10 sec.).

Such time results are very strange as in OpenOffice-3.2.1 and -3.3.0 such filtering works instantly.

Received a resume and cover letter in two separate docx files. The Cover letter opened fine but the resume crashed LibO 3.4.3 - just double clicking on the file caused the crash before the app opened. I have also tried opening it using the open button from the main LibO app window buy selecting the file and the file type (MS Word 2007/2010 XML) - same result.

We are using LibO 3.3.2 in our enterprise and the resume opened it was blank but it did not crash.

Correct selection

When selecting faces in K-3D selections are fine in Mesa 7.0.1 but seem to go through the object in 7.0.3 (as obtained from ubuntu 8.04). The problem still appeared in the GIT version obtained a few days ago. The 7.0.1 shows correct behavior resulting in the front face being selected (red) when it is clicked. Doing the same operation in 7.0.3 (second screenshot) results in the bottom face being selected even though the front face was clicked. At the moment of the selection click the bottom face was behind the front face. It appears as though when in GL_SELECT mode Mesa gets the depth order wrong.

THe bug appears both in the VBO and non-VBO code for drawing faces. Selection in K-3D happens in GL_SELECT mode.

Hardware is an intel graphics chip:

discard hang testcase

The attached program will render to the screen using this pixel shader:

void main()
{
    discard
}

This actually causes a momentary hang complete with this in dmesg:

[  168.980106] Skipping EDID probe due to cached edid
[  171.832558] [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
[  171.832700] [drm:i915_do_wait_request] *ERROR* i915_do_wait_request returns -5 (awaiting 2230 at 2227)

The system recovers though. This is on Ubuntu Maverick. It also affects the master branch of mesa.

I have the program set up to render one frame wait ten seconds then quit. That way you don't have a hard time killing it like you would if it were rendering this shader in a loop.

If I do run it in a loop I get these messages:
../../intel/intel_bufmgr_gem.c:1243: Error setting memory domains 5 (00000040 00000000): Input/output error .

Which I assume are just the system trying to render during the hang. If I just draw one frame these messages don't appear in the program output.",11,"0"

GLib-2.0 requires pkg-config which is tool for tracking the
compilation flags needed for libraries

But pkg-config doesn't work.

configure: error: pkg-config and glib-2.0 not found please set GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS to the correct values
 
In the INSTALL file there is nothing to explain WHAT values GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS
should be set to or HOW to set those flags.

Here is a question:
If users know SO MUCH about terminal configuration shells and installs 
how come they are just NOW downloading GTK?

Who is your audience someone who has been programming 20 years?

configure: error: pkg-config >=  required but not found (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/)
*** Error during phase configure of cairo: ########## Error running ./configure --prefix /Users/jacobisrael/gtk/inst --libdir '/Users/jacobisrael/gtk/inst/lib' --enable-pdf --enable-quartz --enable-xlib=no --without-x   *** [18/24]

 

 
I have a MacBook OSX 10.4 Dual Intel Core
All I wanted was to make some graphics with C++.
So maybe you could just tell me how to get C++ to talk to X11.
Then I can give up on GTK.

"MESA-3165","texImage.IsCompressed and texImage.CompressedSize issues","texImage.IsCompressed and texImage.CompressedSize are set in
_mesa_init_teximage_fields based on the texture's internalFormat specified by
the application. However the driver may want to choose an uncompressed format
instead of a compressed one or it may want to compress textures with e.g.
internalFormat=GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA which is not recognized as compressed right
now. In such cases IsCompressed ends up being clearly wrong and leads to weird
crashes later on. I suspect that wrong texture image sizes and/or row strides in
_mesa_store_teximage_... are responsible.

I believe texImage.IsCompressed and texImage.CompressedSize should be
initialized after the driver has chosen a hardware texture format and based on
that hardware format instead of the internalFormat specified by the application.

hi
  I vote for adding embeddedbitmap option to official fontconfig.
  Several distros have shiped patched version of fontconfig which adds
an option like rh_prefer_bitmap or embeddedbitmap. Because we need a way
to explictly tell Xft/Cairo to load bitmaps embedded in fonts or not.
And for cairo if i want to cairo transform a font to pretend as an
oblique one and when i disable antialias for the font then cairo will
always load embedded bitmaps if available latter cairo(exactly to say
it's freetype) will be unable to transform the font glyphs because they
are bitmaps. If option embeddedbitmap is available we can tell freetype
to load outlines rather than embedded bitmaps by set embeddedbitmap to
false and then can transform font glyphs as expected. Xft is smart
enough in this case it add FC_LOAD_NO_BITMAP to load flags when loading
glyphs. But that is not easily to implement in cairo because cairo
doesn't handle FC_MATRIX itself.",132,"1"

Presently that is the behaviour I see when Scale is triggered using a corner trigger or using a key binding that doesn't involve any modifiers (Ctrl Super Shift or Alt).

However when Scale is triggered using a key binding involving modifiers Scale mode exits as soon as I release at least one of the modifier keys. When triggered using a mouse binding Scale mode exits as soon as I release the mouse button that triggered it. This creates an odd situation where I must continue holding onto the mouse button that triggered Scale in order to select a window and exit Scale mode normally.

Would it make more sense for Scale mode to remain active until a window is selected or the trigger is re-invoked in all cases?",522,"1"

    drm/i915: Fix up the vma aliasing ppgtt binding

    Currently we have the problem that the decision whether ptes need to
    be (re)written is splattered all over the codebase. Move all that into
    i915_vma_bind. This needs a few changes:
    - Just reuse the PIN_* flags for i915_vma_bind and do the conversion
      to vma->bound in there to avoid duplicating the conversion code all
      over.
    - We need to make binding for EXECBUF (i.e. pick aliasing ppgtt if
      around) explicit add PIN_USER for that.
    - Two callers want to update ptes give them a PIN_UPDATE for that.

    Of course we still want to avoid double-binding but that should be
    taken care of:
    - A ppgtt vma will only ever see PIN_USER so no issue with
      double-binding.
    - A ggtt vma with aliasing ppgtt needs both types of binding and we
      track that properly now.
    - A ggtt vma without aliasing ppgtt could be bound twice. In the
      lower-level ->bind_vma functions hence unconditionally set
      GLOBAL_BIND when writing the ggtt ptes.

    There's still a bit room for cleanup but that's for follow-up
    patches.

    v2: Fixup fumbles.

    v3: s/PIN_EXECBUF/PIN_USER/ for clearer meaning suggested by Chris.

"MESA-105396","tc compatible htile sets depth of htiles of discarded fragments to 1.0","Created attachment 137887
Renderdoc v1.0 capture

On RADV when using a VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT (or VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT_S8_UINT) depth buffer cleared to 0.0 if a fragment shader discards all fragments in a cleared htile the htile's depth can be set to 1.0 instead of keeping the clear value of 0.0.

The attached renderdoc capture reproduces the issue by clearing the depth buffer to 0.0 with vkCmdClearAttachments then drawing a triangle in the upper left half of an image using a shader which discards fragments that lie outside of a semicircle. The bug doesn't reproduce if I remove the vkCmdClearAttachments and use VK_LOAD_OP_CLEAR at the start of the render pass. However I have another more complex application which appears to be using VK_LOAD_OP_CLEAR in an earlier renderpass and loading stored depth values in a renderpass which reproduces this bug without using other clears in the middle.

I'm using git revision fb5825e7ceeb16ac05f870ffe1e5a5daa09e68dd on an AMD RX 480.

It is indeed pointless: GObject upstream don't consider appending to a GInterface vtable struct (the ones that start with a GTypeInterface) to be an incompatible change.

wjt's branch fixes AccountStorage a recently-merged branch fixes DispatchOperationPolicy and the branch in the URL field here fixes the remaining implemented-by-plugins classes so far namely RequestPolicy and DBusAcl. It also improves some documentation.",0,"0"

The following command brings up a mail composition dialog with blank subject instead of the subject 안 as expected on my system with gawk installed:

xdg-email aaa@aaa.com --subject 안

However this works fine on systems that use mawk (such as Feisty). The problem is within the awk code embedded in the url_encode function:

-- snip --
for ( i=1 i<=length ($0) ++i ) {
    c = substr ($0 i 1)
    if ( ord [c] > 127 ) {
-- snip --

In gawk string manipulation functions such as length are unicode-aware and return the number of unicode characters instead of the number of bytes. This would usually be a good thing but in this case the unicode character should be broken up into bytes to be encoded properly. 

Setting LANG and LC_ALL to C right before this snippet tricks awk into thinking the string is ascii and processes it accordingly.",1374,"1"

Best reproduced with this:

unset the /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop gconf key.
(It seem that as a seperate bug nautilus keeps cdrom opened thus blocks the ejection) then close all nautilus windows.

Now insert a disk observe that it can be ejected with button.

Generate PDFs with correct font names

Cairo exports font names in their original form. But these can be wrong they can sometimes contain white space characters or PDF/PostScript delimiter characters. Such fonts are not common but they appear.

This can cause a problem when you are printing such file in evince. The printing fails during processing of an intermediate PDF because there are delimiter characters where they shouldn't be.

Attached patch escapes PostScript names of fonts (ps_name variable) right after these are loaded. It was already case for TrueType and OpenType fonts but not for pure CFF fonts. Type1 fonts were just shortened to the last correct character.

INTEL_DEBUG=batbuf output prior to error

I reliably get the attached (INTEL_DEBUG=batbuf) error when running:

MESA_GLES_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.1 ./deqp-gles31 --deqp-visibility=hidden --deqp-case='dEQP-GLES31.functional.compute.indirect_dispatch.upload_buffer.single_invocation'

Note that I have Ken's recent patch series to fix up some compute state tracking: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/3213/ although the error also happens without it.

"WAYLAND-101796","Keys can get stuck permanently when grabbing keyboard with evdev","The logic in evdev.c (https://github.com/wayland-project/libinput/blob/688142c8a22c00cfe7b9dec6a71e935b899d8b65/src/evdev.c#L167-L169) remembers how many times a key is pressed simultaneously and only emits KEY_UP events when this counter is incremented to 1 and KEY_DOWN when it is decremented to 0.

This is problematic as key release events might get dropped for example if the keyboard is exclusively grabbed by evdev's EVIOCGRAB while a key is pressed.

This issue is easily reproducible by launching one instance of libinput-debug-events (or any libinput-based application that reads keyboard input) and then running this in another terminal:
libinput-debug-events --device /path/to/keyboard --grab  killall libinput-debug-events)

Because you submit the command by pressing the Enter key and libinput-debug-events launches fast enough the release event for your Enter key happens after the device is grabbed so the first instance of libinput-debug-events will not receive it. Because of this bug the Enter key is now permanently stuck there as it is always pressed either 1 or 2 times so libinput will never send any key events for it again.

(Please note that running this test inside any libinput-based desktop environment (xf86-input-libinput or Wayland) obviously triggers the same bug and may force you to restart your window manager.)

"DBUS-56043","dbus-daemon loses journald sockets on restart and does not sanitise when subsequently calling dbus-daemon-launch-helper leading to SIGPIPE failures","OK the summary is a bit long but it does at least explain things correctly!

This issue is a bit hard to describe but I'll do my best.

Versions: systemd 194 gnome-shell 3.6.1 dbus 1.6.8 fprintd 0.4.1

After a fresh boot login to gnome. fprintd is started via dbus activation at login and exits after a short timeout. If I lock the screen it is launched again when trying to unlock and again exits after a short timeout. I do not have any finger print h/w on this machine so this is largely unused by me but it operates correctly. Several lock+unlock attempts show now problems.


Then I restart the systemd journal: systemctl restart systemd-journald.service.

This is where things go wrong. I lock fine but when trying to unlock (slide the shield up) all I get is a blank screen - no dialog to enter my password. Why is this I hear you ask. Well gnome-shell ultimately tries to launch fprintd via dbus activation as before. dbus calls dbus-daemon-launch-helper to launch /usr/lib64/fprintd. This exits with SIGPIPE and bubbles up as an exception to gnome-shell. Now gnome-shell should be fixed to still show me the password dialog here but that's a separate issue the real issue is why the crash?

Well with some investigation the SIGPIPE is caused by fprintd output to stdout or stderr which is in the closed state.

Upon even further investigation fd's 1 and 2 are both sockets.

While I cannot confirm 100% it's my guess that dbus-daemon has simply lost it's connection to journald to which it's stdout/err are normally piped. When it then calls dbus-daemon-launch-helper it inherits these closed pipes and if any launched application then tries to output anything and hasn't called signal(SIG_PIPE SIG_IGN) itself then it will crash and this will bubble up the stack.

So suggested work arounds are:

1. When the stdout/err are closed try to re-establish connection to the journal.
 or
2. Sanitise stdout/err in dbus-launch-helper such that if they are closed then redirect them to /dev/null instead such that at least apps are started even if logging is sacrificed - i.e. make the best of a bad situation!


Hope this is clear but feel free to ask for clarification!",0,"0"
"XORG-28852","[i965 page flipping] GPU hang on 2.6.34-45 32-bit PAE kernel with GL compositor","I'm trying to get page flipping working on all my Intel hardware and I'm hitting a hang on my 965GME hardware (AVALUE EMX 965GME motherboard Core 2 Duo T7250 CPU). Unlike the 945 hang (being chased in bug 28788) it's not immediate and easy to reproduce - it takes around 2 days of continuous uptime (60Hz display) and doesn't tickle the hangcheck timer so intel_error_decode doesn't find anything. With the aid of echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger I've been able to determine that X is stalled in the kernel in i915_gem_wait_for_pending_flip

"MESA-105567","meson/ninja: 1. mesa/vdpau incorrect symlinks in DESTDIR and 2. Ddri-drivers-path Dvdpau-libs-path overrides DESTDIR","A meson/ninja install using option -Ddri-drivers-path overrides the DESTDIR variable and install to the path specified by -Ddri-drivers-path. Therefore files don't get packaged or logged with the files that do get installed to DESTDIR.

The above behaviour differs from an autotools build and install in which --with-dri-driverdir does not override DESTDIR.

Slackware installs dri modules in /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/dri.

Leaving -Ddri-drivers-path to the default value allows DRI drivers to be installed in the DESTDIR directory but then xorg-server will need to be recompiled to find the new DRI driver location.

Meson/ninja installing vdpau libraries (two bugs in one):

1.Symlink bug
If using DESTDIR variable WITHOUT -Dvdpau-libs-path then the symlinks libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0 libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1 libvdpau_radeonsi.so incorrectly point to ${DESTDIR}/lib64/vdpau/libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0 and not /usr/lib64/vdpau/vdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0.  Autotools building would have symlinked to /usr/lib64/vdpau/vdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0 when installing to DESTDIR.

2. DESTDIR bug/meson feature
If using DESTDIR variable WITH -Dvdpau-libs-path then all vdpau related files and symlinks install to /usr/lib64/vdpau/. Symlinks correctly point to /usr/lib64/vdpau/libvdpau_radeonsi.so.1.0.0.

"DBUS-66493","dbus headers not tolerant to namespace pollution","Original bugreport on RedHat Bugzilla.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=980278

OS: Fedora 18.

Description of problem:
The current mingw header  pollutes the namespace with a '#define interface ...'.  While this is bad practice the dbus package should avoid the problems it causes by picking names that are less likely to collide in its function declarations or even omitting parameter names altogether (and just declaring parameter types without names).  I ran into this while trying to cross-compile libvirt for mingw.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
mingw32-dbus-1.6.8-1.fc18.noarch
mingw32-headers-2.0.999-0.15.trunk.20121110.fc18.noarch

"DRI-105018","Kernel panic when waking up after screen goes blank.","I'm currently running on latest Manjaro XFCE with the 4.15 kernel just released and I found that the system would crash when trying to wake up after the screen went blank.

The system is an AMD Laptop (ASUS ROG STRIX GL702ZC) and the problem is 100% reproducible with the following steps:

- Lock the screen leave the screen blank for at least 3-5 minutes.
- Try wake the screen up like moving the mouse cursor.

At first I did not find the cause but after looking into the journalctl I was able to find something that appears to be a kernel panic. It existed since the beginning with the 4.14 kernel and remained unsolved even after upgrading to 4.15 kernel.

The cause seems to be dce110_vblank_set+0x4f/0xb0 [amdgpu] with the topmost call trace being dce110_vblank_set+0x4f/0xb0 [amdgpu].

The bug report here which was closed last December resembled my current issue:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2017-November/016236.html

I've thought about the possibility of it being DC-related as I saw similar bug reports but I was wrong as at one time I was able to reproduce it even after passing amdgpu.dc=0 during boot. The modules don't seem to be related as it happened on fresh installs where I left the screen blank (before I actually adjusted power management options) as I let it download and install packages I wanted in the background.

Additionally I'm able to find some additional errors prior to the crash which might have happened when the screen went blank. It could be done by simply locking the screen and leave it as is. (NOTE: When I locked the screen and then immediately move the mouse cursor to wake it up the crash would not occur. It would only occur if the screen went blank for at least 3-5 minutes.)

For now I could only prevent the panic from happening by not allowing power saving functions to happen especially anything that would turn off the screen. I'm also not allowed to lock the screen it would also blank the screen and the GTK+ greeter could blank the screen in its own way. 

However it's not feasible for running the system on battery for an extended period without any power saving feature given the high total TDP the laptop has and leaving the system unlocked is a bad idea in terms of security and privacy.

By the way given there were a few similar closed bug reports in the past I believe the problem might be a regression.",210,"1"

dmesg from UX31A running under 3.10.5 with drm.debug=0xe

This has been reported in ALT Linux bugzilla (in Russian) posting here at Kirill's request as I've confirmed a report by another user on the same hardware I happen to use.

3.10.x kernels up to and including 3.10.5 result in turning off the backlight at i915 module load time on ASUS UX31A (i7-3517U) dmesg with drm.debug=0xe and late module load (not in initrd) is attached external VGA monitor works fine (dmesg and Xorg.1.log available if needed).

Here's a transcript of sysfs knob fiddling over ssh:

root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat actual_brightness 
0
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat max_brightness 
4302
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # echo 800 > brightness       
root@ux class/backlight/intel_backlight # cat actual_brightness       
4302

and corresponding bits of dmesg (including further attempts at putting 100 and 80 values into brightness both resulted in actual_brightness reading the same values but the screen backlight is still off):

[  877.052934] [drm:intel_panel_actually_set_backlight] set backlight PWM = 4302
[  881.868818] [drm:intel_panel_get_backlight] get backlight PWM = 4302
[  974.670199] [drm:intel_panel_get_backlight] get backlight PWM = 4302

[  990.186065] [drm:intel_panel_actually_set_backlight] set backlight PWM = 80

acpi_video0 doesn't have any effect either.

This bug hasn't manifested itself on 3.9.7 with very similar configuration on the same hardware.

"POPPLER-102880","Missing chars in rendered PDF","Created attachment 134339
PDF which shows the problem

When rendering the attached PDF with actual poppler some chars are not shown. Looking into it I figured out that the included truetype font has no cmap table and try the TrueType 'post' table to handle any unmapped characters is not working correctly because in FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() some chars were skipped.

With xpdf 4.00 the PDF is shown correctly.

Comparing poppler code of FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() with the xpdf code 4.00 I encountered that this bug was probably introduced with a patch I uploaded for bug 84270.

But reverting FoFiTrueType::readPostTable() from poppler to the xpdf 4.00 code doesn't only renders this PDF correctly it renders also the PDF of bug 84270 correctly.

And since the xpdf 4.00 code is cleaner I would prefer to take over this code again!",100,"1"
"XORG-13857","xbacklight sets random brightness","Normally xbacklight sets the LCD backlight brightness between 0-100% however this does not work on my nc6120 laptop. Some values result in the expected brightness but some in full brightness.

I did some debugging and found that if the least significiant bit is set in the brightness register it forces full brightness ignoring the upper bits. If it's reset then the upper bits mean the normal pwm value.

So I've did the following hack on the intel driver:

--- i830_lvds.c.old     2007-11-15 22:02:59.000000000 +0400

This always forces the lowest bit to zero and xbacklight is now working as expected. No more flashing but nice smooth brightness change )

Is there anyone who could create a decent patch from this?

X log showing crash on a non KMS kernel

Using ati driver 6.2.99 (aka git shapshot as of 92baeafde8f0c1eed2b6769e96f8093e3d6d7478 (today)) works fine on a KMS aware kernel.
However if booting on a non KMS kernel where it failed to load the radeon kernel module it crashes trying to set up the 3D engine despte advertising disabling DRI.

Here /etc/modprobe.options contains options radeon modeset=1 and thus radeon kernel module failed to load because of the unknown option with a non KMS kernel.

logs shows a crash in RADEONInit3DEngine() despite DRI being disabled. See attache traces.

Card is radeon 9600 (RV350).
Xserver is 1.6.2. Mesa is 7.5. ATI driver is 6.2.99

Solution: do not try to init 3D engine at all if DRI is disabled for whatever reason it is.",54,"1"

in the second frame the pEntry being NULL of course was causing the core dump. The fact the core dump only happens ( for me ) when accessibility was turned on was a bit of a red herring as was this stack itself. It turns out that the core here is a side affect of other badness that happened earlier. Valgrind trace shows

gives the real hint the selection changed event calls somewhere down it's stack 'ScNameDlg::UpdateChecks' which in turn modifies a checkbox ( which triggers another handler ) as these handlers are asynchronous and the SelectionHandler can call code the modifies the internal structures that both handlers use we get problems. Afaict 'ScNameDlg::UpdateChecks' should never trigger the event handlers for the checkboxes whose state it modifes as it is just syncing the state controls with that of the internal model.",4,"0"

Code to reproduce this issue. Requires SDL2.

Hi

I'm trying to get the Banshee 3D engine  working on my hardware (HD 7870) using Mesa radeonsi (amdgpu kernel module). I use 17.2.4-0ubuntu1~17.10.1 from the Ubuntu artful-proposed archive.

It uses a compute shader that reads a texture cube and writes 6 sets of coefficients into a shader storage buffer object. Details are not important as I have isolated the (probably) incorrect driver behaviour and created a much simpler program that triggers the same issue.

In short: Let's say we have a GLSL struct and access the SSBO through a dynamically-sized array of that struct type using the std430 layout like this:

struct ResultRecord
{
	float a[10]
	float b[10]
	float c[10]
	float weight
}

layout(std430) buffer gOutput
{
	ResultRecord ssb[]
}

Then a simple assignment of a local variable of the same struct type to ssb[i] writes the floats into incorrect buffer offsets because b c and weight are placed as if the array elements in a b and c were vec4-aligned instead of float-aligned tripling the size of a b and c.

Code that triggers it is like this which should hopefully be valid GLSL (and makes more sense the way it is used in Banshee 3D):
ResultRecord result
// ... populate result ...
ssb[gl_LocalInvocationIndex] = result

The test program is available here and contains a (maybe too) detailed explanation and three program variations that fix the issue: https://gist.github.com/w-flo/b1a5791749eea5f36cb54628037ba2bf
But I'll also attach it to this bug report.


Looking at the RADEON_DUMP_SHADERS=1 output I think that the bug is already visible in the TGSI dump as explained in the comment at the top of my reproducer program. I'll attach the output (it's possibly based on an older version of the reproducer).",4,"0"

Test program to help reproduce the bug

If the root window and all its subwindows are redirected to off-screen storage by using XCompositeRedirectSubwindows with the update parameter set to CompositeRedirectAutomatic some windows fail to repaint correctly in some conditions.

To reproduce this bug:
(1) ensure that windows are NOT currently redirected to off-screen storage
(2) run the attached test application or run xcompmgr -a if you have it installed. 
(3) open any regular window then open a menu window so that it overlaps with it partially
(4) close the menu window and open it again in another position so that it will not overlap with the regular window
(5) observe that the part of the regular window that was covered by the first menu window is cleared and then it's not normally repainted anymore

I can reproduce reliably on a machine running Ubuntu Linux 11.04 which runs X.org version 1.10.1 with Linux kernel 2.6.24-29-server x86_64
The window manager running is Metacity (with Metacity's own compositor disabled).

The menu windows mentioned in steps 3 to 5 are those that appear when right clicking on the desktop. I don't know what is special about them in X11 terms but there are no other windows that exhibit this behavior that I could find.

"XORG-29255","DisplayPort output distorted","Created attachment 37394
distortions on external display

I have a notebook with switchable graphics (discrete ATI Mobility Radeon HD 
5650 and integrated Intel Arrandale). The DisplayPort only works with the 
discrete adapter but this limitation also exists in Windows so I guess the 
DisplayPort is hard-wired to the discrete card.

If I use the radeon driver it detects whenever I plug something into the 
DisplayPort. E.g. I have a DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter (for projectors) and 
test it with my LCD monitor that luckily has a VGA input too. xrandr detects 
the connection and suggests the correct resolution and frequency (1680x1050 
@60Hz). But the image is totally distorted. It looks like a old tube monitor 
that runs a too high frequency you can see this on the attached screenshot. What you cannot see is that the distortions move quite fast and are not static.

I switched back to 1024x768@60Hz but the problem persists and the optional 75.1Hz do not make any difference too.

The same settings work fine with Windows so I suspect this issue to be caused by the radeon driver.

Is there any way to see what's going wrong and maybe fix this?

Dmesg on ubuntu lucid beta 2 installed (does not work)

I can't start the ubuntu lucid beta 2 liveCD on a computer with a Nvidia GeForce 6200 (NV44A rev A1) : the screen stays blank after booting.
It works properly with a ubuntu lucid alpha 3 liveCD (which probably uses a previous version of nouveau) and ubuntu karmic liveCD (which uses nv driver)

I managed to install the beta 2 on this computer through the alternate CD : the behavior is the same when booting on the hard drive.
I installed all the updates (as of 16th april 2040) : same behavior

I experience the precise same behavior with Fedora live : Fedora 12 live boots correctly (but relies on nv driver) Fedora 13 beta live gives the same blank screen (and also uses nouveau driver).

I think this is a regression in the nouveau graphic driver : the version bundled with lucid alpha 3 works the one with lucid beta 2 (or fedora 13 beta) does not.
Here is an excerpt of the dmesg on beta 2 :
  nouveau 0000:03:00.0: RAMHT space exhausted. ch=0
  nouveau 0000:03:00.0: Error referencing VRAM ctxdma: -12
  nouveau 0000:03:00.0: gpuobj -12

This error message does not appear when using lucid alpha 3.

I found that adding nouveau.noaccel=1 as a boot parameter is a workaround both on ubuntu lucid beta 2 and on fedora 13 beta

My motherboard is a Asus A7N8X-E deluxe on which a GeForce 6200 video card (branded MSI) is in the AGP port.

Sample file to show the problem

When Splash::fillGlyph2() draws a character if the starting X location is negative it increments the pointer to the glyph data to start at the position in the glyph data that should go at X position 0.
If glyph->aa is set the glyph data is one byte per pixel and the increment by abs(x start) is correct.
If glyph->aa is not set the glyph data is one byte per 8 pixels and the increment should be by abs(x start)/8 and the loop that scans the data should be offset by abs(x start)%8.
Splash::fillGlyph2() currently adds the same increment of abs(x start) whether or not glyph->aa is set and when glyph->aa is not set drawing a character with a negative X position can cause a bad memory reference.  For example running

i965: Validate Special Requirements for Handling Double Precision Data Types

I did not implement:

   CNL's restriction on 64-bit int + align16 because I don't think
   we'll ever use this combination regardless of hardware generation.

   The restriction on immediate DF -> F conversions because there's no
   reason to ever generate that and I don't even know how DF -> F
   conversions are supposed to work in Align16 since (1) the dst stride
   must be 1 but (2) the dst stride would have to be 2 for src and dst
   strides to be aligned.

Following is my analisys and a possible patch:

ModemManager tries to set default storages for MEM2 and MEM3 only with `+CPMS` providing an empty string for MEM1 argument::

     [1448531013.833175] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=MEME'

     [1448531013.967401] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:792] set_default_storage_ready(): Couldn't set default storage: 'Operation not supported'

Some modems do support NULL arguments (considering that as a request to do not change the correspondant value) but passing an empty string should be considered invalid since it is not a supported value::

     [1448531007.342611] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): --> 'AT+CPMS=?'
     [1448531007.389244] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): '
     [1448531007.418215] [mm-port-serial-at.c:440] debug_log(): (ttyACM0): OK'

According to the previous logs only SM and ME are supported strings so the command should at most be `AT+CPMS=MEME`

However HE910 does not support NULL argument either so I made the following changes in order to provide always the current value of MEM1 if no other value is provided
this way the code works fine with HE910 and should work with the other modems too since it's conservative::

EXA seems to work quite stable with the current Intel driver shipped with Jaunty and i915. But if I use UXA it hangs very often. The most common problem is changing to text console while a video is running. It works at first but while switching back the screen stays black but the movie goes on. SSH connect is still possible but after a short period the whole system hangs.

If I change to console without running XV at first everything works fine.

I have saved the graphic registers according to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen.

I am using xv overlay because of the tearing problem. I haven't tested the problem with textured video yet but it is no real option atm.

The composite Kwin desktop effects are enabled.

The whole video memory seems to be corrupted because if I restart the system X crashes the first time and I have to relogin. Afterwards I couldn't switch to text console. Only black and colored vertical lines are shown but it is possible to switch back. If I shutdown the system and boot again it is possible to login automatically and switch to console and back. I guess both problems seem to be connected.

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=691551

I had a newly installed XP instance and i installed spice-tools including the
qxl driver. I still got 800x600 even when i restarted the VM. I had to resize
the window to get it to tell the agent to resize to the window size. I think we
need to do this on the first spice connect too.

Our application requests (via XRRSetCrtcConfig) the 1920x1080 with a 148.5 MHz dot clock (which comes from monitors EDID).

xrandr --verbose shows this is the set and active mode.

However monitor says it is running with 175.9 MHz dot clock and can't adjust to that signal.

"PULSEAUDIO-100451","module-switch-on-port-available will only select unavailable ports when a new sink or source appears","module-switch-on-port-available - the helper function new_sink_source
iterates over the device ports and picks the one with the highest priority
but then just before returning does this:

    if (p->available != PA_AVAILABLE_NO)
        return NULL

ie the selected port is returned _only_ if it is NOT available.

This logic error appears to be in pulseaudio 10.x also.

This is used by (for example):

  static pa_hook_result_t sink_new_hook_callback(pa_core *c pa_sink_new_data *new_data void *u) {

      pa_device_port *p = new_sink_source(new_data->ports new_data->active_port)

      if (p) {
          pa_log_debug(Switching initial port for sink '%s' to '%s' new_data->name p->name)
          pa_sink_new_data_set_port(new_data p->name)
      }
      return PA_HOOK_OK
  }

So this module will never choose an available port.

The p->available != PA_AVAILABLE_NO pattern appears all over the place in
this module but I _think_ this is the only place where it's used the
wrong way round.

The following fixed the symptom(s) here (and the pa -vvvv log indicated that
a more sensible set of choices was being made with it applied):

The simple fix would be:

a check for NULL and a message to cairo_test_log this particular SEGV no longer

"CAIRO-15652","[directfb] Regression in 1.6 making gtk/directfb not repaint changed window areas correctly","Quoting http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=477331:
=============================================================

I just tested the graphical installer with the new libraries and I'm
afraid there's a serious regression. It looks like old screen content is
not getting wiped when new elements get displayed.

As cairo is the only library to have changed recently I'm fairly
certain that the cause is there possibly related to the breaking out of
libpixman. I've uploaded some screenshots to show the issue.

Initial screen after boot (no problems):
- http://people.debian.org/~fjp/tmp/d-i/cairo-regression1.png

After scrolling up in the list previously selected lines should not be red:
- http://people.debian.org/~fjp/tmp/d-i/cairo-regression2.png

After scrilling down to English again the red partly disappears except
for the two thin lines around Dutch and a line in the left margin:
- http://people.debian.org/~fjp/tmp/d-i/cairo-regression3.png

The next screen still shows text from the previous one (Choose a
language: and the dot under the s in Based:
- http://people.debian.org/~fjp/tmp/d-i/cairo-regression4.png

This is the clearest example. It should only be showing a progress bar
but instead still has the full previous dialog and all progress info is
printed on top of itself resulting in the almost black bar:
- http://people.debian.org/~fjp/tmp/d-i/cairo-regression5.png

Note that the installer used a directfb backend not X.

The version it worked with was 1.4.14 the version that had this behaviour is 1.6.4. Nothing else was updated so it's most likely a regression in cairo.",1388,"1"

Thanks to krh it seems this was because /var/run was not a symlink to /run: krh says systemd expects dbus' socket to be in /run  but dbus puts it in /var/run . If they are symlinks this doesn't matter but if they aren't it very much does matter.

Older Fedora installations won't have the symlink setup and we don't have a hook in fedup to turn it into a symlink at present I don't think. It would be good to make things work with a separate /var/run at least where possible.",0,"0"

However p11-kit/iter.c also typedef's P11KitIter (lines 62-96) and in a different way which of course conflicts with the p11-kit/iter.h typedef and therefore you can't compile p11-kit/iter.c because of this (not with HP's ANSI C at least).

Mutter (the compositing manager for GNOME 3) is an excellent way to cause GPU hangs. The following hang was caused by running Mutter and OpenArena but pretty much any gl app more advanced than glxgears will cause a hang when Mutter is used.

Due to lack of proper classification several software vendors started to use unofficial:

Spec should cleanly say which category should be used for this type of software.

Possible solutions:
a) keep everything as is document mapping software Categories: Geoscience or Geography (ugly)

b) Introduce new category: Mapping Maps or Navigation with allowed secondary categories Graphics Utility Education Science (and maybe Research see bug 20186)

    glsl: Don't trust loop analysis in the presence of function calls.

    Function calls may have side effects that alter variables used inside
    the loop.  In the fragment shader they may even terminate the shader.
    This means our analysis about loop-constant or induction variables may
    be completely wrong.

    In general it's impossible to determine whether they actually do or not
    (due to the halting problem) so we'd need to perform conservative
    static analysis.  For now it's not worth the complexity: most functions
    will be inlined at which point we can unroll them successfully.

    Fixes Piglit tests:
    - shaders/glsl-fs-unroll-out-param
    - shaders/glsl-fs-unroll-side-effect

    NOTE: This is a candidate for release branches.

    drm/i915: Use for_each_crtc() when iterating through the CRTCs

    Patch done using the following semantic patch (thanks Daniel for the
    help!)

      @@
      iterator name list_for_each_entry
      iterator name for_each_crtc
      struct drm_crtc * crtc
      struct drm_device * dev
      @@

      +for_each_crtc(devcrtc) {
        ...
      }

    Followed by a couple of fixups by hand (that spatch doesn't match the
    cases where list_for_each_entry() is not followed by a set of '{' '}'
    but I couldn't figure out a way to leave the '{' out of the iterator
    match).

    drm/i915/vlv: reset VLV media force wake request register

    Media force wake get hangs the machine when the system is booted without
    displays attached. The assumption is that (at least some versions of)
    the firmware has skipped some initialization in that case.

    Empirical evidence suggests we need to reset the media force wake
    request register in addition to the render one to avoid hangs.

"SYSTEMD-89048","DOC: the man pages should clarify that systemctl daemon-reload is the way to make systemd reread /etc/fstab","Hi

http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.mount.html#fstab reads that:

Mount units may either be configured via unit files or via /etc/fstab (see fstab(5) for details). Mounts listed in /etc/fstab will be converted into native units dynamically at boot and when the configuration of the system manager is reloaded. In general configuring mount points through /etc/fstab is the preferred approach. See systemd-fstab-generator(8) for details about the conversion.

Once the user modifies the /etc/fstab it is difficult to find out how to regenerate the units. Usual advice given by many is to reload the configuration systemctl daemon-reload which does not do the trick.

Running /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator does not change existing units (systemctl list-units --all) either.

Someone on Arch Linux forum adviced that /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-fstab-generator /run/systemd/generator '' '' should work.

Not obvious from the man pages of systemd-fstab-generator which mentions something in Examples but without any reference to the actual location.

systemd-fstab-generator converts /etc/fstab into native mount units. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated unit files in order to allow the user to override fstab with his own native unit files but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any vendor default from /usr.

Looking at it from today's perspective it may seem clear - just read and understand a buch of man pages. But without knowing the actual command argument syntax I guess I would have to stay with the easy-to-carry-out reboots of the computer. The old style was simply mount -a written directly in the man page.

How about an equivalent for systemd-fstab-generator which would simply carry out the default task which is done during boot?",2,"0"

tarball with /debug/dri/0/ tree plus dmesg and Xorg log

System is Fedora 14 x86_64 with latest updates. Self-compiled linux-3.0 kernel. Desktop uses gnome+compiz.

Since testing the linux kernel 3.0 I have been sometimes getting image freezes. I can move the mouse but no other updates appear on the screen. The dmesg shows this:

[13492.748011] [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
[13492.748018] [drm] capturing error event look for more information in /debug/dri/0/i915_error_state

[13493.251011] [drm:i915_reset] *ERROR* Failed to reset chip.

I got the entire /debug/dri/0 directory shortly after the freeze. This along with the Xorg.0.log file and the full dmesg file is attached.

No idea of how to trigger this issue voluntarily. I have noticed that this issue seems to occur more frequently when running VirtualBox but running slabinfo does not show memory corruption with slub_info=FZPU.

    drm/i915/dp: Only apply the workaround if the select is still active

    As we may try to power down the link at various times it is not
    necessarily still coupled with an encoder and so we must be careful not
    to depend upon an operation that is only valid when the link is still
    attached to a pipe.

Hi

I'm getting graphics errors and screen corruptions with the latest git-version of the intel-driver.

The bug is very easy to reproduce for me :

Just open Firefox and surf to the website www.windowsbase.de. Sometimes the errors are even worse and the xserver is crashing immediately.

The strange thing is that Google Chrome does not trigger this error but Epiphany Webkit does (Both based on Webkit). Perhaps a problem with Cairo?

Steam start options:
MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.3 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=430 %command%

When the main menu comes up the complete rendered background (not menu dialogs) is fading slowly to white (also ingame and benchmark).

If i append MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE=-GL_ARB_compute_shader to my steam start option there is no fading > the menu is rendered as expected.

I have made an apitrace and replayed it...
Without GL_ARB_compute_shader there are errors because Shadow of Mordor wants to use it but rendering LOOKS ok.
With GL_ARB_compute_shader the errors are gone but there is this white fading.

So I guess there is something wrong with GL_ARB_compute_shader!
Could someone look into this?

You can download my apitrace here...

"XKEYBOARD-CONFIG-21624","keyboard mapping of win/alt to control_L fails","I filed this with Gnome but they sent me to you hope you can help:

I use gnome-keyboard-properties to change my Alt/Win key behavior to be the
same as my control key. This works initially but fails over time. When I'm not
using the machine it doesn't fail.

Steps to reproduce:
1. gnome-keyboard-properties
2. Layouts tab
3. Keyboard model Apple (unnecessary I think)
4. Layout USA
5. Layout Options...
6. Alt/Win key behavior
7. Control is mapped to the Win-keys (and the usual Ctrl keys).
8. Use your computer for a few days it will work initially then fail.

Actual results:
I'll notice the alt/win key no longer works and then I run xmodmap -pke | grep
133 which shows:
keycode 133 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L NoSymbol Super_L

Expected results:
When the keys are mapped correctly I can run xmodmap -pke | grep 133 which
shows:
keycode 133 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L NoSymbol Control_L

Does this happen every time?
Yes in any given 72 hour period it will happen at least once. If I'm not
using my computer it doesn't happen.

Other information:
I'm using an apple A1048 keyboard I don't think that's related.
I've been having this problem for over a month I haven't been able to diagnose
a cause yet.
The workaround is to check change the Alt/Win key behavior back to Default
then change it back again.",48,"1"

Example of redenring with artefacts

Hello

The Intel driver appears not to render textures properly. The textures look smoother and slihgtly blocky as if they were strongly compressed. When forcing software rendering by setting the LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE environment variable everything appears to be rendered properly.

I am running Mesa 12.0.1 (I selected 11.2 as 12.0 is not available in the form but note that this has been a long standing issues not a recent regression).

Here is the game's log when using the intel driver. Comparing it to when using the software rendering one important difference is that there is no anisotropic rendering. Fiddling a bit in the game's configuration file to increase a parameter called maxanisotropy makes things look even worse.

Add zoom and ThinkPad events to acpi addon for IBM

As of kernel 2.6.25 there are acpi events generated for the Fn+Space button combination and for the ThinkPad (a.k.a. Access IBM and ThinkVantage) button both on IBM/LENOVO ThinkPads.

I'll attach a patch (git log -p format) that adds zoom and ThinkPad button events to the acpi addon for IBM/LENOVO ThinkPads. The names I chose for these events are just some (safe) guesses.

This patch fixes a trivial typo too (Fn=Insert).

With this patch both events show up in dbus-monitor --system. If only I knew how to do something actually useful with these dbus messages I see scrolling by ...",4,"0"

If this happens the underlying semaphore resource is released but the semaphore type is not updated to NONE.

yoga11s_one_finger_still.txt (evemu recording)

Lenovo Yoga 11S touchpad is jittery. The cursor moves a little even when I try to keep my finger still.

This is noticeable after hysteresis has turned off but libinput hysteresis was definitely not helping since it made the touchpad unusably numb and unresponsive. So the jitter problem I'm talking about here in libinput 1.10 is much better than how it was previously :)

The same jitter happens with the synaptics driver if I turn off hysteresis there. Although synaptics with hysteresis provides a nice experience... seems to be a dramatically lower hysteresis threshold.",22,"0"

To make this more reviewable I would prefer to fix these two warnings as a unit but with each commit doing one thing by following this process:

* Land what's on Bug #97357 or use my warnings branch on Github as a base
  

* Enable the warnings locally but do not make them fatal by building with
  make CFLAGS=-Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default -Wno-error=switch-enum -Wno-error=switch-default

* Go through each affected switch or closely related group of switches
  (for example switching over values of the same enum can probably be
  grouped) fix both warnings at the same time and do one commit
  per group

* After all those commits add one commit removing -Wno-switch-enum and
  -Wno-switch-default from the AX_COMPILER_FLAGS* arguments so that this

"ACCOUNTSSERVICE-44408","not filtered by default shell /bin/nologin","Apparently this (new?) login component has completely changed the (unwritten?) agreements about what users should be filtered out of the user list in the login dialog.

Traditionally when presenting a list of users to choose from when logging in a user whose login shell is specified as /bin/nologin will not be included in the list.

Having a filter list as an extra method is okay (see bug 41908) but it's not the traditional method and silently changing the behavior is a potential security risk.

If in keeping with the (in my opinion ill-advised) shift to capabilities it is deemed desirable to go with a configurable lower limit on numeric user ids and a filter list there should at least be some serious public discussion (as on distro user lists) before the change is implemented and there should be an incubation period during which both the filter list and the nologin shell are recognized.

I personally would prefer the traditional behavior be kept. There is no reason on desktops or servers for /bin/nologin users to be offered the opportunity to log in in most cases. For those that prefer a separate filter list the configuration file could be allowed to override the traditional behavior on a per-user basis whether to show or hide. (Reference bug 41908.)

If the change was made to accommodate wireless carriers who might be deluded about the ability to keep the platform more secure by preventing all non-graphical logins it would be better to add a /bin/guiloginonly default shell value.

Filtering on lack of specified password is a good option but is also contrary to traditional administration techniques. If such behavior is to be included it should be set or unset in the configuration files as well.",84,"1"

"XORG-16259","Gnome panel flickers through into fullscreen SDL games","Short repro steps (using ubuntu hardy):
1. Add System Monitor as a gnome panel.
2. Install and run the game supertux (or basically any other fullscreen SDL game).

Detailed repro steps (for non-ubuntu users who want to see the bug):
1. Boot Hardy live CD.
2. Right click gnome panel in the top gray area maybe 2 cm left of the blue help icon.
3. Select the Add to Panel menu item
4. Select System Monitor (it's quite far down the list with greenish icon).
5. Add universe as source in apt (use System::Administration::Software Sources and check the checkbox called Universe).
6. Run sudo apt-get install supertux to install a SDL game.
7. Select Applications::Games::Supertux2

Expected results:
Gnome panel items should not engage in Z-order fighting with supertux while supertux is running in fullscreen.

Actual results:
Gnome insists on updating the panel CPU meter and also some other thing so basically two big black boxes appear along the top of the screen inside supertux. They just randomly flicker and it makes the game more or less unplayable.


Note 1: The same bug repros other games for instance you can try installing the Extreme Tux Racer game from the etracer package in Ubuntu.

Note 2: This is not a driver bug. I'm using a Intel X3100 GMA card with a 965GM chipset and this bug was confirmed by a guy who has a ati radeon 9550 card.

Note 3: If I set System::Preferences::Appearence::Visual Effects to None then the bug goes away. This is the way you turn of compiz in ubuntu so that's why I think this is a compiz bug.

"FREEDESKTOP.ORG-17378","mail routing problems","Once upon a time many years ago fd.o was using a version of postfix which was fairly broken -- for domains with an IPv6-only primary MX (as was infradead.org at the time) I believe would behave as if the primary MX had a Legacy IP address of '0.0.0.0'. Then it would bounce the mail since it believed that resolved to _itself_ and it had no knowledge of infradead.org as a local domain.

Rather than fixing postfix or switching to a non-broken MTA I believe a workaround was put in place -- just a hardcoded rule so that all mail to the infradead.org domain was routed directly to pentafluge.infradead.org ignoring the MX records.

That was fine for some years but pentafluge is being retired now and is no longer receiving mail. It's still on the MX list but it died last week for some reason and if it wasn't for the fact that fd.o is still trying to send mail there nobody would have cared.

Please can someone fix the mail routing?

Xorg.0.log

My laptop is an HP Envy 17 3D. I am running Gentoo and using vgaswitcheroo to switch between radeon and intel (i915). I have the radeon driver working with some difficulty (see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58894) - i.e. I have to attach an external monitor to get the laptop screen turned on after KDE has started.

I would like to be able to use the intel driver and switch off the radeon chip because it uses much less power. I can do this using vgaswitcheroo but the intel driver gives me 2 problems:

1) The laptop screen stays black after the boot process has completed. If I attach an external monitor I can get a picture on that but the laptop screen just stays black.

2) Moving the mouse pointer to the top left corner (rather the top left square of maybe 1/3 of the screen) the screen starts to flicker from the mouse pointer and downwards.

I also notice that it takes quite a while before KDE displays anything during the boot with the intel driver enabled compared to the time it takes if the radeon driver is used.

This line appears several times in my Xorg log file:
(EE) intel(0): Unable to write to SDVOCTRL_E for SDVOB Slave 0x70.

I have done some searching and several people have mentioned this but no one knows what this error is or how it might degrade the system.  

Since I'm having some problems with the driver (for example see my bug report regarding glDrawPixels #19888) I'd like to know what causes this error and what driver capabilities are affected.

System environment:
-- chipset:  GME965
-- system architecture: 32-bit
-- using default Fedora 10 packages (xorg-x11-server 1.5.3-6.fc10 intel 2.5.0)

-- Linux distribution: Fedora 10
-- Machine or mobo model: embedded board (Intel Core2 Duo CPU T7500 @ 2.20GHz

Reproducing steps:

The problem is that dbus-signature.c unit tests do the following many times:

_dbus_assert (dbus_signature_iter_next (

This is incorrect because the operation executed within the assertion is not
idempotent i.e. it has side effects.  That operation advances given iterator. 
As a result if the code is built without assertions these lines are not
compiled which translates in the program not behaving as expected.

The solution is to call these operations outside the assertions and only assert
their results.  Doing so the test passes correctly (under NetBSD at the very

    i965: always run the post-RA scheduler
    
    Before we would only do scheduling after register allocation if we
    spilled despite the fact that the pre-RA scheduler was only supposed to
    be for register pressure and set the latencies of every instruction to
    1. This meant that unless we spilled which we rarely do then we never
    considered instruction latencies at all and we usually never bothered
    to try and hide texture fetch latency. Although a later commit removes
    the setting the latency to 1 part we still want to always run the
    post-RA scheduler since it's able to take the false dependencies that
    the register allocator creates into account and it can be more
    aggressive than the pre-RA scheduler since it doesn't have to worry
    about register pressure at all.

    galliumst/mesa: don't use blit-based transfers with software rasterizers
    
    The blit-based paths for TexImage GetTexImage and ReadPixels aren't very
    fast with software rasterizer. Now Gallium drivers have the ability to turn
    them off.

unmanage_children num_unmanage_children manage_children num_manage_children

But looking at the sources and Composite.h file reveals that the order is
actually different (taken from cvsweb):

extern void XtChangeManagedSet(
    WidgetList          /* unmanage_children */
    Cardinal            /* num_unmanage_children */

I.e. that the do_change_proc+client data pair is BETWEEN the lists not AFTER them.

And of course following the manual page makes program SIGSEGV.

This error seems to be there from the very introduction of XtChangeManagedSet().

"PORTLAND-13435","xdg-email - Thunderbird does not support email attachments","On http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/EmailConfig it says Moziila Thunderbird does not support email attachments from xdg-email.

It turns out Thunderbird disabled attachments via a mailto: URL on purpose because they believe it is not secure. [1]

I'm proposing the following workaround: (see attachment)

In open_kde() / open_gnome() look up the email client kde/gnome is trying to run. If the client contains Thunderbird in its name then call run_thunderbird() which parses the mailto url reformats it in a way that Thunderbird accepts and then run Thunderbird.

open_xfce() does not need to do this because exo-open already does this. [2]

    drm/i915: create vmas at execbuf

    In order to transition more of our code over to using a VMA instead of
    an  pair - we must have the vma accessible at execbuf time. Up
    until now we've only had a VMA when actually binding an object.

    The previous patch helped handle the distinction on bound vs. unbound.
    This patch will help us catch leaks and other issues before we actually
    shuffle a bunch of stuff around.

    The subsequent patch to fix up the rest of execbuf should be mostly just
    moving code around and this is the major functional change.

    v2: Release table_lock earlier so vma allocation needn't be atomic.
    (Chris)

Since spec version something recent there's been a method that CMs can implement to turn a dictionary of parameters into a unique identifier for the account suitable for MC to use when building the object path: . MC should use it where possible. This also allows MC to prevent you creating two copies of the same account.

The Story:
I had a pdf-image that was rotated using pdftk. This image was included in a
pdflatex run as embedded image. The resulting pdf is correctly displayed in
Adobe Reader but within Evince this image is unrotated (off be 90°)...
Unfortunately I cannot give the example but I'll try to come up with a
test-file within a few days...

For now my analysis of the pdf shows that there is the following sequence
within the pdf:
12 0 obj <<
/Type /XObject
/Subtype /Form
/FormType 1
/PTEX.FileName (C:/the/path/to/rotated_picture.pdf)
/PTEX.PageNumber 1
/PTEX.InfoDict 28 0 R

/BBox [0 0 596.25 843]
/Group 13 0 R
/Resources <<
/ExtGState <<
/s5 29 0 R
.....

My guess would be that Evince does not correctly parse the /Matrix for the
XObject as the Matrix
0 -1
1 0
would correspond to the missing rotation...

Just start your xserver turn on MouseKeys then after 5-15 minutes MouseKeys will stop working (i use sawfish).  A friend of mine experiences this too (xfce4 debian sid).

Other related quirks:
  - sometimes a key gets stuck (rare).  For example the letter 'a' so the text aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... gets typed into the current application.  Sometimes a modifier gets stuck this way like control or meta.  I can bring it out every time by playing any flash game on kongregate.com which uses the keyboard.
  - sometimes (raaaaare) sticky keys stops working too.  That's it keys arent sticky any more.
  - after MouseKeys stops working I can't switch terminals using Control-Alt-F keys.  Just doesn't work.  Before that I can use that combo as usual.

I can help with any testing you need just contact me.

dmesg from working kernel (commit 56350fb8978bbf4aafe08f21234e161dd128b417)

TLDR - Commit a45b30a6c5db631e2ba680304bd5edd0cd1f9643 breaks external displays attached to a Dell TB16 dock.

Hardware is a Dell Precision 5520 developer edition laptop attached to a Dell TB16 (Thunderbolt 3) dock.  This laptop does not have a separate discrete GPU only the GPU integrated into its Core i5 processor.

OS is Fedora 27 but dmesg files in this bug are from mainline kernel.

When the laptop is docked it is closed and I use *only* the displays (and keyboard etc.) attached to the TB16.  This works fine up through commit 56350fb8978bbf4aafe08f21234e161dd128b417 but commit a45b30a6c5db631e2ba680304bd5edd0cd1f9643 causes the displays to be disabled as soon as the i915 module is loaded leaving no working display at all.

I had a heck of a time preventing the i915 module from being loaded so the two dmesg files were produced with the following sequence:

* Blacklist the i915 module in /etc/modprobe.d and rebuild the initramfs
* Rename the i915.ko file under /lib/modules/...
* Reboot to multi-user.target
* Remove the drm modules that somehow got auto-loaded
  - modprobe -r drm_kms_helper
  - modprobe -r drm
* Rename i915.ko back to its correct file name
* Load the drm and i915 modules with debugging enabled
  - modprobe drm debug=0x0f
  - modprobe i915",114,"1"

Shaders with faulty and non faulty versions

I'm the main developer of Ogre 2.1

Our shaders produce incorrect results on Mesa. (we always use std140)

I believe the problem is caused by incorrect packing of structs. It's 05:30 am now so I couldn't double check yet.

I am attaching the Vertex shader and Pixel shader. The main and only difference between the two is that one does shadow mapping the other one doesn't.

The one doing shadow mapping just glitches. By glitches I mean colours are washed out (as if lighting was really wrong) or just black.
This happens with all of our samples where shadow mapping is done.

I believe this is caused by our unusual struct definition:

struct ShadowReceiverData
{
	mat4 texViewProj
	vec2 shadowDepthRange
	vec4 invShadowMapSize
}

struct Light
{
	vec3 position
	vec3 diffuse
	vec3 specular

	vec3 attenuation
	vec3 spotDirection
	vec3 spotParams
}
layout(binding = 0) uniform PassBuffer
{
	//Vertex shader (common to both receiver and casters)
	mat4 viewProj

	//Vertex shader
	mat4 view
	ShadowReceiverData shadowRcv[3] //This is not in the good shader

	//Pixel shader
	mat3 invViewMatCubemap

	float pssmSplitPoints0 //Not present in the good shader
	float pssmSplitPoints1 //Not present in the good shader
	float pssmSplitPoints2 //Not present in the good shader
	Light lights[1]
	
} pass

May worth noting this bug also happens on SW rasterizer because the exact same output can be seen on a virtual machine.

I'm attached the shaders both under Good and Bad folder.

I'm guessing you're gonna need more information from me so let me know what I'm missing. Ideally I would have time to track this down to the exact variable in the wrong offset but I don't have the time (and it's 05:48am already!).

You probably should add our samples to your testing suite. A lot of them don't work with Mesa and would help improve Mesa greatly.
Our code can be found at:
https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/src/dc52e186d53611b20d4f99d30266c56c29099ef7/?at=v2-1-pso
I can provide assistance compiling our samples. (or binary blobs if it's too much hassle)

Just as an example this is how our PbsSample is supposed to look: http://imgur.com/7lCnZ6h
This is how Mesa renders it (incorrectly): http://imgur.com/SfOsBgY
This is how Mesa (correctly!) renders it when shadows are disabled (Note: In the pbs sample there are 3 lights but when shadows are disabled Ogre will only use 1 light): http://imgur.com/mS1i74Y

In other samples activating shadow mapping just results in zero. My best guess is bad offset calculation.

Working (but ugly) fix of early boot vsnprintf/vasprintf segfault

Hi

Beginning in post-systemd-189 git and still present in systemd-191 there is a nasty problem in function log_struct_internal() (src/shared/log.c) which renders my PC unbootable giving an early boot systemd[1] segfault in /lib/libc-2.16.90.so and 'Freezing execution.'

My system: i686-pc-linux-gnu gcc-4.7.1 glibc-2.16.0 linux-3.6.0-rc6 systemd-191 (all software built from source).

The segfault is due to a misuse of the vsnprintf() and vasprintf() functions. Specifically one must not use va_arg() after calls to vsnprintf() or vasprintf() as these function/macros internally use va_arg() and may modify it undefined ways. In particular from the vsnprintf manpage:

The functions vprintf() vfprintf() vsprintf() vsnprintf() are equivalent to the functions printf() fprintf() sprintf() snprintf() respectively except that they are called with a va_list instead of a variable number of arguments.  These  functions  do  not  call  the va_end macro.  Because they invoke the va_arg macro the value of ap is undefined after the call.  See stdarg(3)

and from the stdarg manpage:

va_arg()
    ...
    If ap is passed to a function that uses va_arg(aptype) then the value of ap is undefined after the return of that function.


In systemd-191/src/shared/log.c we have the following problematic code in log_struct_internal():

705                 va_start(ap format)
706                 while (format && n + 1 < ELEMENTSOF(iovec)) {
707                         char *buf
708 
709                         if (vasprintf(&buf format ap) < 0) {
710                                 r = -ENOMEM
711                                 goto finish
712                         }
713 
714                         IOVEC_SET_STRING(iovec[n++] buf)
715 
716                         iovec[n].iov_base = (char*) 
717                         iovec[n].iov_len = 1
718                         n++
719 
720                         format = va_arg(ap char *) <---- use of ap here is invalid/non-portable
721                 }
722                 va_end(ap)


741                 /* Fallback if journal logging is not available */
742 
743                 va_start(ap format)
744                 while (format) {
745 
746                         vsnprintf(buf sizeof(buf) format ap)
747                         char_array_0(buf)
748 
749                         if (startswith(buf MESSAGE=)) {
750                                 found = true
751                                 break
752                         }
753 
754                         format = va_arg(ap char *) <---- use of ap here is invalid/non-portable
755                 }
756                 va_end(ap)


It appears that the assumption has been made that ap is internally incremented as values are formatted into buf but there is no guarantee that this will occur. Apparently it does occur for some architecture/compiler/libcs while not for others. This is truly unfortunate as the vsnprintf/vasprintf-relaled code now in log_struct_internal() is in my judgement quite elegant.

One way around this would be to write code to parse the format strings enough to figure out the number and types of args associated with each format (tricky and counter to the use of vsnprintf/vasprintf in the first place and probably a pain to maintain and port).

I have attached a patch which 'fixes' this issue in the sense that I'm now up and running with systemd-191 and all appears to be well.. but it's a bit of a hack and admittedly rather ugly. What I've done is to pass each format-vararglist pair in now occuring in log_struct_internal() calls to a new function log_struct_entry() which produces the desired string. Then log_struct_internal() calls simply have to deal with a vararglist of strings.

hope this helps and thanks for your time
John

"DBUS-27110","Port DBus-Daemon to Windows CE","Hi

this is a series of patches porting DBus-Daemon to Windows CE using cegcc cross compilation under GNU/Linux.  As Windows CE only provides a limited subset of the Windows API and an even more minimal and broken subset of the POSIX'ish Windows API I approached this port in the following way: Convert the existing Windows port fully to the Windows API replacing remnants of Unix-ish interfaces (_open _mkdir _readdir etc) by their Windows-ish counterparts (CreateFile CreateDirectory FindNextFile etc).  The advantage is that this makes the port more uniform and also avoids confusion (for example POSIXish checking of return values of Windowsish interfaces as happened for MoveFileExA).  If you are not with me on this design decision the whole set of patches needs to be abandonend (or rather: reworked).  The alternative I can think of is implementing the POSIXish interfaces for Windows CE but that may be messy as this may conflict with what's there already.  Please let me know if you feel strongly about this.

I have isolated the changes to the Windows port in a first patch (0001).  This patch is tested not to break the Windows build (the unit tests dbus-test complete successfully and a KDE program still works).  Issues addresses are among others: Use of Windows API instead of POSIXish APIs indirect use of errno (which does not(!) exist in Windows CE and needs to be replaced by Set/GetLastError).

The second patch (0002) makes more code that depends on signal.h and locale.h conditional.  These header files and associated interfaces simply don't exist on Windows CE.

The third patch (0003) adds Windows CE detection to configure.in and also adjusts the winsock library (it's -lws on CE instead of -lws_2 on NT nobody seems to know why this is different).

The fourth patch (0004) then fulfills the promise of the 0001 patch and implements the parts of the Windows API that are missing on Windows CE.  Notably it provides wrappers for the ASCII variants of the interfaces as Windows CE only has Unicode interface variants.  The alternative to switch the dbus code base to unicode is too invasive for this port (but would make large parts of this patch obsolete).

The fifth patch (0005) is an unfortunate work around for a discrepancy of the Windows NT and Windows CE command line parser in the wrapper around main() [Windows standard is to have WinMain as entry point which gets a command line string that is then parsed by the application.] Windows CE and NT have different ideas how to break the cmdline into strings for argv.  In particular Windows NT expects the first component of the cmdline to be the program name (argv[0]) while Windows CE gets the program name from the ModuleName and expects the first component of the cmdline to be the first argument (argv[1]).

The sixth patch (0006) ports the dbus-monitor.c program from tools.

The seventh patch (0007) adds a README.wince to the root directory with further information on the port.

The eighth patch (0008) includes a patched version of libtool for the build.  Current versions of libtool unfortunately don't support Windows CE cross-builds correctly: The libtool wrapper programs do not compile for this platform and there is an error in the detection order.  Note that this patch would become obsolete by upgrading to an upcoming working libtool version (our changes needed for WinCE have been submitted and accepted upstream).

I also have a port of the dbus-launch tool in the works but I want to clear the queue before cleaning that up.  I will append it to this bug report shortly.",88,"1"

    drm/i915: Create a more generic pm handler for hsw+

    HSW has some special requirements for the VEBOX. Splitting out the
    interrupt handler will make the code a bit nicer and less error prone
    when we begin to handle those.

    The slight functional change in this patch (queueing work while holding
    the spinlock) is intentional as it makes a subsequent patch a bit nicer.
    The change should also only effect HSW platforms.

LOGS

Hello

Problem description:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) hangs the GPU.


Expected Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) should not hang the GPU.


Obtained Results:
Running any Media Player Webcam App (Cheese or Guvcview) freezes the system for a few seconds but afterwards (3 sec. approx.) I can close the application that caused the GPU hang.
Video output is non-existing in Cheese or Guvcview (I only see the black window where the video should be).
If I still try to take a picture with Cheese for example it will capture the photo correctly!
When playing a movie file I get no video (only sound output is available).


When does it happen: Always (no special steps are necessary to reproduce this error).

dmesg output

Hello graphics team

I am on an almost up-to-date (kernel at 4.9.4 ATM) Arch Linux system with the [testing] repository enabled. My hardware is the old integrated GPU in an AMD E2-2000 mobile CPU (Wrestler [Radeon HD 7340]) using the Radeon r600 driver.

A few weeks ago before Christmas I noticed that a stable tear appeared in movie players and games using OpenGL on X11. This was most likely caused by a package update but I did not investigate further. In hindsight the reason was most likely the package update from xf86-video-ati 7.8.0-2 -> 7.8.99.r13.g404c6475 that I performed on 2016-12-16 (There appeared an Arch bug report implicating this version [1]. The package is currently at 7.8.99.r16.gea30d856 but the problem still exists. As far as I can see nobody else reported this upstream yet.).

I have a 1366x768 display and the tear seems to appear be at a height of ~100 pixels from the top. Also it seems to start at 0x0 (from top left) with a short diagonal to about 100x100 and then reaches horizontally all the way to the right. This tear does not appear under Wayland for me. It also seems to disappear as soon as DRI3 is disabled by setting the xorg.conf option or by setting LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1 before starting e.g. the video player or the game (video player: mpv --vo=opengl --hwdec=vdpau game: Stardew Valley). As far as I remember I had DRI3 explicitly enabled in my xorg.conf without any problems before this package update.

I tried capturing the issue with my cell phone camera but was unsuccessful.

Reading the mailing list I noticed a few recent bug reports due to DRI3 but I did not find one complaining about tearing. Similar reports appear to be quite a bit older. I might have missed something though or somebody else participating in [1] might have reported it in the meantime.

The versions of the packages that might be relevant are:

xf86-video-ati 7.8.99.r16.gea30d856
linux 4.9.4
xorg-server 1.19.1
mesa 13.0.3
llvm 3.9.1

The Xorg.0.log glxinfo output and kernel log should be attached.

Thank you for your work on the graphics stack.

"MODEMMANAGER-92243","SMS Storage couldn't be parsed on Huawai MU609","Hello 
I have some trouble with a Huawei MU609 modem. The SMS storage is detected as unknown so SMS can not be deleted on the SIM card and it became full. 

Here is the debug log : 

 [1443785966.873323] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:1127] load_supported_storages_ready(): Couldn't load supported storages: 'Couldn't parse supported storages reply: '+CPMS: SMSMSM''

  [1443785976.459443] [mm-iface-modem-messaging.c:968] interface_enabling_step(): Cannot set default storage none of the suggested ones supported. 

The problem seems to be located in mm_3gpp_parse_cpms_test_response() in mm-modem-helpers.c. This method use g_strsplit_set and a regex to detect the replay based on this example : 

+CPMS: (SMME)(SMME)(SMME)

but this Huawei one is formated differently : 

+CPMS: SMSMSM

So method return false ... and the messaging store is detected as unknown. 

For testing propose I modified those lines : 

split = g_strsplit_set (mm_strip_tag (reply +CPMS:) () -1)
r = g_regex_new (\\s*\([^\\)]+)\\\s* 0 0 NULL)

by those ones

split = g_strsplit_set (mm_strip_tag (reply +CPMS:)  -1)
r = g_regex_new (\\s*([^\\)]+)\\s* 0 0 NULL)

and it works on my hardware but I don't own another to test if it's the good way to fix this. 

Hope it could help to fix this bug upstream.

"XORG-24278","ChangeLog: this generated file is not cleaned from the dist directory","When we add a file to the distribution automake does not know about so it is not removed automatically by distclean. We should have a line in the makefile:

DISTCLEANFILES = ChangeLog

When running distcheck to verify the tarballs it performs a VPATH build in a temporary _build directory. It then proceeds to clean it and verify it is empty. To do that it invokes the distcleancheck a command that is only available from a VPATH build. This command would normally print out an error because of ChangeLog still being present. The distcheck target then removes the whole VPATH build.

It doesn't print an error at the moment because the CHANGELOG_CMD macro has overwritten the distcleancheck code to ignore the ChangeLog file. In the context of distcheck it does not matter because the whole temp build is removed right after.

There are 3 issues with overriding distcleancheck_listfiles:

1) It is not scalable. If we generate other files that need to be cleaned the CHANGELOG_CMD would need to know about it which makes no sense.

2) Only the error is suppressed the file is not removed

3) When running autoreconf -Wall a warning is emitted about the fact that distcleancheck code has been overwritten.

Given that there is a clean solution which does not have any of the 3 issues above we should update the makefile appropriately.

A side note about the generated tar files
-----------------------------------------
When creating a VPATH build (so we can see what is going on during a distcheck) you will notice an error about the tar files left in the directory. This is an inconsistency in Automake. The distcheck target does explicitly remove the tar files before running distcleancheck so we don't see an error message when running distcheck. This is not an issue for us.",60,"1"
"DRI-97354","After update to kernel 4.7-1 plasma won't login","Created attachment 125794
Journal log with kernel 4.7-1 using intel driver

I have a desktop machine (Intel Ivybridge DQ77KB ) and running Arch linux. After update to kernel 4.7.0-1 with the usual pacman -Syu my desktop initially boots up fine and presents the sddm greeter screen as normal - but when logging in the usual splash screen appears on the monitor with the progress bar moving across but at around 90% through this process the plasma login seems hangs for many seconds - eventually the splash screen disappears and I end up with just the desktop background image - but no taskbar and the mouse becomes active again after being unavailable whilst the progress bar and splash are on the screen. Once the mouse is active again and I can select the usual options with right click including the logout option. Rebooting makes no difference and logging out and back in also makes no difference.

Downgrading the kernel back to 4.6.4-1-ARCH allows my plasma desktop to login normally again - so this looks like a possible bug in the 4.7 kernel Intel driver.

I ran some more tests. If I update to kernel 4.7-1 and then remove the xf86-video-intel package and remove the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf so that the system uses the modesetting driver instead of the intel driver then the system boots to a normal graphical sddm login screen and logging in completes to give a normal plasma desktop including the taskbar. However the Kickoff menu opens in a strange way with it seems items off the left of the screen so that they are not accessible. Also if I start the chrome browser it appears to start but is not on the screen - again possibly it is trying to place the chrome window outside of the screen area. So although the graphics partly works it is not usable. 

The versions of key packages are:

"LIBVA-79848","vaDeriveImage returns wrong fourcc after having created a vpp context","I run postprocessing on a different thread than decoding.

In order to achieve this I need to create a vpp context. see here: https://github.com/FernetMenta/xbmc/blob/vpp/xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/DVDCodecs/Video/VAAPI.cpp#L2234

"DRI-94625","[SKL mobile] Some flickering then complete system freeze after HDMI hotplug","When connecting an HDMI monitor the external monitor lights up but the laptop's internal panel will flicker usually until I type a key (have an open xterm focused already) or move the mouse pointer slightly. The display is then stable and I might be able to move the mouse pointer around and start some programs but after a while the system freeze completely (doesn't respond to ping).


System is Dell XPS 15 9550 i7-6700HQ stepping 3 microcode 0x74.

Internal panel is eDP1 3840x2160.
External is 1920x1200. I've tried the HDMI port and also with a TB3->DP
and TB3->HDMI adapters all with same results.

This system also has NVIDIA GM107M but I've disabled both the nouveau and the nvidia driver to rule that out.

move the mouse pointer means using the built-in touchpad.

With
    Fedora 23 plus kernel drm-intel-nightly as of 2016-03-10 21:00 UTC
the system will typically freeze hard within 10 seconds of inserting the HDMI cable (in the laptops fixed HDMI port). It feels like the freeze happens when I touch the mouse but I'm not sure if that's just coincidence.


With
    Fedora 23 plus kernel drm-intel-nightly as of 2016-03-19 13:00 UTC
the behaviour is slightly improved. I'm now been able to use the system for minutes after hotplugging the external monitor. I still get the flickering of the internal panel when inserting the cable - this disappears when I touch the mouse. I'm then able to type use the mouse move windows between internal and external display etc with no freeze happening. After a while with no apparent problems I disconnected the external monitor - still no problems - then reconnected it again. The external display lights up as expected but now the complete freeze occurred within a few seconds.

Some more attempts indicate that it can still freeze (shortly after) the first hotplug but sometimes not until after the second or third. So it seems reproducible around 3 out of 4 times.

It can also freeze if I use the Gnome Display control panel to disable the external monitor then enabling it again (without removing the cable).

Sometimes the flickering that occurs after hotplug will go away if I touch the touchpad slightly and pressing a key doesn't help. Other times it's the reverse - pressing a key will stop the flickering but then moving the mouse pointer slightly will set it off again.

During these tests it's happened that the internal panel remains black. At one point it behaved like this:
  a) move the mouse pointer to the EXTERNAL panel => internal panel lights up.
  b) move the mouse pointer back to the INTERNAL panel => internal panel goes black.
During this maneuver the external panel consistently showed a correct image.",387,"1"

Presentation (one slide) that illustrates the problem.

Problem description: 
When a circle or other curved shape is combined with a picture (resulting in a picture with a transparent hole in it) the Slide show displays a larger polygon instead of the actual shape. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. In a new presentation insert a picture from a file.  (Enlarge it if desired to fill the slide.)
2. From the Basic Shapes toolbar select the Circle tool.  Draw a circle on the slide on top of the inserted picture.
3. Select both the circle and the picture.  From the right-mouse menu choose Combine.  The result is a transparent circular hole in the picture.
4. Start the slide show.  Instead of a circle the transparent hole is a larger octagon.
(The same problem affects other shapes as well including ellipse ring and cylinder.)

Current behavior:
Slide show displays the transparent hole as a larger polygon.

Expected behavior:
Slide show should display the shape correctly as normal slide view does.

(gdb) print t3GlyphStack
$1 = (T3GlyphStack *) 0x0

Here we can see the global variable T3GlyphStack is null which means it might not be initialized correctly when a malicious crafted PDF file is being handled.

This vulnerability has been reproduced in both the latest stable release 0.59.0 and the latest code in the repository.

A pdf file has been attached to help to reproduce this vulnerability.",0,"0"

patch for xdg-utils

The latest commit 781023ef997bac433dbc258bd5cfdc1366f2ffa4 not only bumps the version but also adds a t letter breaking syntax. xdg-open uses bashism for years (introduced in commit ba265f969b9061d221915c2528122c44a85ad7c2) and it breaks multigroup desktop files actually (easily verified with Google Chrome sed shows an error because 'localised_name' var receives 3 lines and thus the sed command isn't terminated properly). One of the cases there is [*) and while it works in bash dash uses “[” as a meta-character. I've quoted it to make it work.",0,"0"

Hi
I have been testing the Android Tutorial5 from gstreamer-sdk. 
When I try to build the project with support for ffmpeg plugin I keep getting following error:

luigi@Fender:~/workspace/Tutorial5$ ndk-build

The .o files are referencing compress and compress2 from zlib but the symbols in such library are z_compress and z_compress2 (there is a #define compress z_compress in the header) so i guess this is a compilation error? also I just need to use h264 from ffmpeg so is there any plugin or module i can disable for this error not to happen? (I don't really need flash or tiff decoding)

I am attaching the jni/Android.mk file is the only thing I changed in tutorial5 project.

Thanks

Is this a hard coded variable?  I would expect that setting the PULSE_COOKIE variable would allow me to prevent the first file from getting created.  I do not have all of pulseaudio installed just libpulse as a dependency of other packages.

Greetings

I recently got a second display and have been experiencing reliable GPU lockups when starting full screen games on one of the displays. The steps to reproduce go as follows:

  1) Run gnome-shell 3.8.4 as your desktop interface (this is sufficient at least)
  2) Have a multi-monitor setup
  3) Start a full screen game that only appears on one monitor

The result is several lockups that are eventually freed and errors in dmesg and such. I believe that OpenGL acceleration of the desktop is a necessary prerequisite as this behavior doesn't occur in say fluxbox. But I've observed the behavior with multiple games some of which don't (I think) use OpenGL. At the least I've seen it with Awesomenauts (which may be using OpenGL) and Icewind Dale running in wine (which I would suspect isn't but I may be wrong).

This is definitely related to multi-monitors as well because if I disable one monitor in the gnome system settings the problem goes away. Also if the game does full screen by switching the monitors to mirror one another the problem will not occur (probably because that is equivalent to a single screen setup). I observed this with Battle for Wesnoth.

I had thought this was related to Bug 54226 but was informed that this was unrelated and should post a new bug.

I'll attach my Xorg.0.log dmesg and /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_error_state from after a lockup.

Relevant hardware/software is as follows:

  CPU/GPU: i7 4770/HD4600
  Motherboard: ASrock z87 extreme6
  
  arch linux kernel 3.10.10
  gnome-shell 3.8.4
  mesa 9.2.0
  xserver 1.14.2
  intel drivers 2.21.15

Let me know if you need any other information and I'll attempt to provide it.",1,"0"

As you see the test docs when making a numbered and sub numbered list in LibreOffice 4 and use ODT format it is OK. But when we exporting to RTF format I loose my subnumbers.

Description: I'm taking an online AI class where the first project was to modify a python pacman game. The game would crash the xserver whenever it tried to draw pacman facing up or down. Multiple Arch users reported this bug as well across multiple desktop environments and at least xf86-video-intel (HD4000) and xf86-videeo-nouveau (GeForce 6100). Python was using the Tk interface. This Tk script will cause the crash. (Run with wish . It will work as expected with -start 10 or -start 190 but will crash with -start 100 or -start 280. I was able to run an XCB program that drew arcs that open up and down as expected but I don't know if that means anything..

EXACT STEPS LEADING TO PROBLEM:
(Explain in detail what you do (e.g. tap on OK) and what you see (e.g. message
Connection Failed appears))
===========================================================
1.syncevolution -l funambol funabol 
2.syncevolution -c -y username=moblintest1 -y password= funambol
3.syncevolution -c -y useProxy=1 -y proxyHost=http://proxy01.pd.intel.com:911 funambol
4.syncevolution -r -s two-way funambol addressbook 

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
===================
Sync succeeded.

The error message indicates that the server was unreachable. You can check that by opening http://my.funambol.com/sync in a web browser.

If that works double-check the proxy configuration. If not try again later.

Thanks! Retest it as before and it works now guessing the server just being down last time.

Proposed patch -- changes download-only mode to -d

When using the command-line client pkcon to download and install packages using the -y flag causes not only the non-interactive mode to be activated but also the download-only mode to be activated because the 'y' option character is assigned to both noninteractive and only-download.

Attached is a patch that fixes this and assigns the 'd' option character to only-download.",39,"1"

Problem description:
If a heading has a footnote and is added elsewhere by means of a chapter name field (in the header for example) the footnote reference number (which is superscript) shows up in the chapter name generated by the field (as regular text).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Make a new document

mpv verbose output till the point where the application becomes unresponsive

Hardware: AMD Fusion E-450 (PALM)
Driver version (xf86-video-ati): 1:7.9.99+git1705240733.d80d01~gd~x

Playing a video in mpv with the '--hwdec=vdpau' option the player window is created but the application becomes unresponsive and the video never starts. Similarly in Kodi playing a video with VDPAU enabled causes Kodi to become unresponsive to user input and the video never starts.

Strangely VLC can still play videos with VDPAU enabled.

I'm automatically getting the latest git updates through the Oibaf Ubuntu PPA. The problem first occurred somewhere in March or April when VDPAU videos /sometimes/ wouldn't start or took a long time to start (as opposed to the current situation where videos no longer start at all) and going back to the much older Ubuntu 'stock' driver solves the problem.

I'm not sure if it's a bug in the xf86-video-ati driver or some other component. If someone can tell me which component is likely to cause the problem I can track the git commit that started the problem.",12,"0"

The mouse can behave erratically (but the bug is not always reproducible). I had previously reported this bug in the archlinux bug tracker ( https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/30700 ).

I know there was a bug for what every Greek letter was shown as a rectangle in formulae.
I have Ubuntu 10.04 and Libreoffice (local: Italy) as follows:

LibreOffice 3.3.2 
OOO330m19 (Build:202)
tag libreoffice-3.3.2.2 Ubuntu package 1:3.3.2-1ubuntu2~lucid1

The greek capital letter Omega (%OMEGA) is shown both in menu and in writer as a square. Remaining letters are ok.

As a further info that can maybe useful:

Opening an existing file made with OO from standard Ubuntu distribution repositories (which I completely removed before installing Libreoffice from the specific repositories) capital Omega is correctly shown until I open the formula using the formula editor.
Escaping from the formula editor capital Omega is shown as a square.

The flat panel also works correctly in VGA mode I can plug in it is recognized and works correctly as far as I can tell.

    llvmpipe: fix blending with half-float formats
    
    The fact that we flush denorms to zero breaks our half-float
    conversion and blending. This patches enables denorms for
    blending. It's a little tricky due to the llvm bug that makes
    it incorrectly reorder the mxcsr intrinsics:

be the second image. Filtering is somewhat meaningful for
gradients that change very rapidly - imagine zooming out
to infinity on a white-black gradient with EXTEND_REPEAT -
we should get uniform gray not white and black aliasing

Notably when playing minetest normally this doesn't always happen but when it does the screen gets a light covering of graphical corruption confetti (photos to follow - had to be taken on a phone sorry).
Currently running a mesa debug build compiled from git at commit b0626c1f306 after seeing if https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105251 had anything to do with it - I think this is related but not entirely a duplicate as a fix mentioned there did stop the test program there from having an effect but did not stop this problem.

In the course of trying to reproduce this problem in a more repeatable manner I decided to take an apitrace (will attach in following messages). Interestingly the brief trace I took did not crash my system during recording of it but now replaying it will fairly regularly cause the same kind of lockup more frequently than the game itself will.
I ran apitrace replay in verbose mode to see whereabouts it stopped to see if this gave an approximate indications of where things starting going pear shaped.  The point at which output ends is well short of the entire apitrace dump as expected from what I saw - and additionally the stderr appears to contain an exception of some kind. See the apitrace.out.txt and apitrace.err.txt attachments (to follow separately).

I haven't yet got a dmesg output during minetest running itself but I have got some runs (spanning from boot to either hard or soft reboot - sometimes xorg was killable othertimes not) from replaying the offending api trace. These will also be attached in follow-up messages.
These appear to have a lot more GPU faults before the messages about timeouts appear.",12,"0"

Change movzx to movzbl in xform4.S

When building Mesa with the trunk version of clang using its integrated

src/mesa/x86-64/xform4.S:

clang -c -I../../include -I../../src/mesa -I../../src/mesa/main -I/usr/local/include -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -std=c99 -ffast-math -fno-strict-aliasing  -fPIC  -DUSE_X86_64_ASM -DHAVE_POSIX_MEMALIGN -DUSE_XCB -DPTHREADS -DUSE_EXTERNAL_DXTN_LIB=1 -DIN_DRI_DRIVER -DHAVE_ALIAS -DGLX_INDIRECT_RENDERING -DGLX_DIRECT_RENDERING x86-64/xform4.S -o x86-64/xform4.o
/tmp/cc-A7bOtT.s:36:2: error: invalid operand for instruction
 movzx 20(%rdx) %eax
 ^

The mnemonics are ambiguous because there are no suffixes to specify
whether the source is byte or word-sized.  They are accepted by GNU as
and it apparently just assumes we want to zero-extend a byte:

  23:   0f b6 42 14             movzbl 0x14(%rdx)%eax

E.g. move 'b' (byte) to 'l' (dword).  The source in question says:

        movzx V4F_STRIDE(%rdx) %eax    /* stride */

where V4F_STRIDE is the offset to the stride member of the GLvector4f
struct which is a GLuint.

If the original intention was to ignore the upper bytes of the stride
field and just use the first byte then I propose to change the 'movzx'
mnemonics to 'movzbl' which explicitly specify the source and
destination type.  See the attached patch.",1,"0"

glxinfo with Mesa 9.2 patched

Hello

I try to play to Dota 2 on Ubuntu 12.04.2 x86_64 with Unity as Windows Manager. I use ppa to have the last version of Mesa.

When i launch the game the generic (valve logo video ...) are stroboscopic: the screen is cut by black screen frequently. It's the same problem for screen home. I make a screen cast of that:
http://ubuntuone.com/7gtX9pIslBh6Vvkwrj83ML


I have open a bug for Dota 2:
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/602#issuecomment-21978846

Expect: Can launch the game and go to the screen home without Stroboscopic effect.

volund-benchmark.sh

Hello

a general issue encountered in DXVK is that pipelines have to be compiled at draw time as the pipeline state and the combination of shaders used for rendering are not known in advance. This leads to noticable stutter in a lot of games when the shader cache is cold.

The attached script measures the pipeline compile times of the Unity Blacksmith demo which can be downloaded here:
https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/06/24/releasing-the-blacksmith/

I picked this demo because it warms the shader cache as part of its loading process making for a reproducible test case. On my Ryzen 2700X setup all the vkCreateGraphicsPipelines calls combined take about four minutes using the Higher preset on mesa 18.0.1 llvm 6.0 and latest dxvk-master where about 2/3rds of the total CPU time is spent inside LLVM and 1/6th inside libvulkan-radeon.

An optimization I have in mind for DXVK would be to use VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT in order to reduce the initial compile times and to compile an optimized version of the pipeline asynchronously in the background. However this requires driver support for VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT.

Please let me know if this is a viable option and if significant gains are to be expected when implementing support for this flag in the driver.",222,"1"

"XORG-44354","Crash in Mach64UploadToScreen on ATI 3D Rage II+","Turning on the EXA acceleration for the mach64 driver on the ATI 3D Rage II+ creates a segfault as soon as anything serious (for example xterm or gdm) opens on the X server. Note that the mach64 driver does not support DRI for the card.

The segfault appears in Mach64UploadToScreen() in atimach64exa.c to be specific in the memcpy(). Debugging reveals that pDst->devPrivate.ptr of the Pixmap passed in is NULL and hence the driver crashes. Playing with various options in the Device section of the X server does not change the situation except turning off acceleration or changing the acceleration mode from EXA to XAA. Note that the card is slow in any event but any type of acceleration would be welcome.

While it is unclear to me why libexa passes in a NULL Pixmap destination pointer to the call the following patch seems to fix or work around the problem:

    char  *dst        = pDst->devPrivate.ptr
+   if (dst == NULL)
+        return FALSE
    int    dst_pitch  = exaGetPixmapPitch(pDst)

    int bpp    = pDst->drawable.bitsPerPixel
    int cpp    = (bpp + 7) / 8
    int wBytes = w * cpp

A similar patch should also be applied to Mach64DownloadFromScreen() for similar reasons. Probably the bug is not in the mach64 driver but in libexa or any other component of X not passing in valid pointer in first place.",371,"1"

"XORG-38398","[855GM] Dell Latitude D400 + Linux / BSD is living hell.","Dear developers

I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know my experiences running various Free- and open source operating systems on my Dell Latitude D400 (Centrino platform) laptop. 

This started when I wanted to run Ubuntu Maverick this didn't work and gave me a blank black screen on the Live CD. After some searching I found http://www.glasen-hardt.de who provided a working ISO with some fixed drivers. A kernel update broke it again and installing the patches manually broke too. What's more when the system worked I had various artifacts in the interface the most prominent being blacked-out contextual menu's.

On a working running system I upgraded to Natty which broke it again. A blank black screen right after X started.

Fed up I decided to try Fedora 15. This worked only in safe mode (i guess Vesa driver) and gave me only fallback in Gnome 3 a terrible compromise due to the 855GM being blacklisted.

Tired of my GNU/Linux troubles I decided to install PC-BSD 8.2 and guess what? Blank screen upon X initialization. 

I hate to tell you what the system is running right now but I think you can guess.

Will this be fixed or improve in the future or should I go looking for a new machine?",330,"1"

    loader: Add an environment variable to override driver name choice.
    
    My vc4 simulator has been implemented so far by having an entrypoint
    claiming to be i965 which was a bit gross.  The simulator would be a lot
    less special if we entered through the vc4 entrypoint like normal so add
    a loader environment variable to allow the i965 fd to probe as vc4.

Patch to repair some keymap/xfree86 mappings to the symbol files

I updated the mappings based on my best guess on how the symbol files got consolidated. All updated mappings were tested with 'xkbcomp xfree86 -m xxx' to confirm existance but not correctness.

I also added a little note to the README file. It took me a long long time to figure out how to get xkbprint (and xkbcomp) to work.

A friend of the community libreoffice Venezuela says that these files are not a problem in the stable release and that i should download and install the newest version at day (at that time I had the version 4.3.2.2 ).

"XORG-20118","xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball doesn't build on Debian lenny","Hi all --

I have a Sony Vaio PCG-R505ECX with the Intel 82830 CGC video system which I have recently upgraded to Debian lenny and was having some strange video corruption issues.

As a sanity check on the hardware I wanted to try a different video driver for the same chipset and soon found my way to the driver at http://www.intellinuxgraphics.com whose latest stable release is the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0.tar.bz2 download.

This file would initially not configure due to a requirement for libdrm version 2.4.4 but the same page provides the tarball for this version of the library and it built fine on my system using ./configure --prefix=/usr/local make make install.

Subsequent to this the xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 tarball would then configure but it would not build.  The makefile gets an error attempting to build i830_lvds.c.  The error starting from the build line for the problem file is:

  Debian lenny has version 7.1 of the X.org server and provides the associated header files and so forth in a -dev package.

  Is this just too old of an X.org installation to build this driver?  If so can you point me to an older version of the driver?  The chipset in question is rather old so I don't imagine there's a real requirement for new software but I was unable to find any archives of previous xf86-video-intel tarballs which might work.",4,"0"

Cell referencing formula on another sheet does not recalculate.  Cell A is a cell which has a formula with SUM(range).  Cell B is on another page and references cell A.  When a macro adds a row into the range used in Cell A Cell A recalculates automatically but Cell B does not.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Make a column of numbers and below it make a cell with =SUM(R) where R is a range of the column of numbers.  This SUM cell will be cell A.
2. On another sheet make a cell with = X + Y where X is some cell on the same sheet and Y is a reference to cell A created in step 1.  This new cell will be cell B. 
3. Make a macro which adds a row into range R and put a number in the column in that range.
4. Run the macro.

Current behavior:  Cell A updates and recalculates.  Cell B does not recalculate.

Expected behavior:  Both A and B recalculate.

I decided to have a good look at it and tried to find the issues by comparing registers in the randr and non-randr state.

OpenFirmware posts the card and by default sets up a 1024x768 mode only 8 bit color however. For some reason powerbooks have the internal LVDS on CRTC1. When plugging an exernal analog TFT screen it flashes white during OF init but stays black after that. randr2 was able to correctly recognize it. The problem seemed only to happen with the internal LVDS.

thought that might lead to a race in multi-threaded settings.

It looks like it doesn't lead to a race though and XStoreColors (for one) does
call Data many times. This causes an assertion failure in current Xlib/XCB if

"LIBREOFFICE-57929","Switching between absolute & relative external references not possible","Problem description: It does not work anymore to switch between absolute & relative references in Calc if the reference comes from an external file. This used to work in previous versions so it is a regression. In the tested version Calc gives an error message No references found.
IMHO this is a very often used feature in spreadsheet programmes since many values may be imported from other files (e.g. financial calculations). This regression makes Calc almost useless when working with external references.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new Calc spreadsheet and write the value 1 in cell A1. Save the file.
2. Create a second file
3. Type in the second file in cell A2 = and pick with the mouse the cell A1 from the first file. You will see the value of the first file in the second file. So far everything works fine. What you see is a relative reference.
4. Click in cell A2 in the second file and try to hit Shift & F4. This should switch from relative references ='file:///test.ods'#$Sheet1.A1 to the absolute reference ='file:///test.ods'#$Sheet1.$A$1. This does not work anymore. You get the error message No references found.

Cross-check: This feature still works if the reference is in the same file:
5. In the second file write the value 2 in cell B1.
6. Type in the second file in cell B2 = and pick with the mouse the cell B1 in the same file. You see the value as relative reference.
7. Hit Shift & F4 and you see that the relative reference switches to an absolute reference =$B$1.

Hey

I want to commit two new layouts. These are two layouts to write Russian on german keyboards.

The layouts were created by members of the University of Leipzig (Germany) for Windows users (see: http://russisch.urz.uni-leipzig.de/key2000.htm).
I adapted them to Ubuntu/LinuxMint. I have already contacted the creators of this layouts and they allowed me to commit them here.
For now they are offering a bash script which installs these layouts (see: http://russisch.urz.uni-leipzig.de/keyubuntu.htm) but the better solution would be if it was accepted to xkb by default.

I hope this is the right way to make a pull request here. The patch file I created with git format-patch origin is attached to this E-Mail.

"XORG-21738","Attempting to Xv into offscreen GLXPixmap for GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap hangs GPU","I've found a repeatable method to hang the GPU on my 945GME using the latest git head of xf86-video-intel mesa libdrm xorg-server and the assorted current git versions of their dependencies that are needed in order to compile them (for instance libXi which is a minor detail I think to be irrelevant to this report).

In the stock xorg-server the action of using Xv to convert YUV into RGB onto an X11 off-screen Pixmap is an invalid operation. So I also applied the patch from Bug Report #21143 in order to allow this operation to be attempted.

What I do is set up an XvImage object to contain the YUV image and then allocate an off-screen Pixmap object to receive it. Prior to the transfer I use the features in the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap to build a GLXPixmap object that refers to this offscreen pixmap. I then bind this to a texture and then proceed to run a loop where I blit the texture to the screen using GL_QUADS modify the XvImage rerun the XvPutImage and then attempt to re-blit.

The Xorg server hangs (inside the kernel ioctl) presumably waiting for the card to complete an action. The hang occurs at the point where the application calls glXSwapBuffers(). I am using libSDL-1.2.13 which wraps this inside of SDL_GL_SwapBuffers().
