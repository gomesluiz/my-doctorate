"CORE-383478","File type confusion vulnerability due to null bytes in URL (encoded as %00)","Posted on 0x000000.com by Ronald van den Heetkamp

Firefox Remote & Local Code Excution 0day.

I found this vulnerability in Firefox moments ago while I was playing with the urlbar.
It seems Firefox is vulnerable to null byte file type corruption. It is possible to execute files as a different filetype and trick Firefox into executing it. Is this dangerous? yeah it's pretty bad.

Pointers that are vulnerable:

file:///
resource:

Use:
[uri]/[filelocation]/[file][.ext]%00[.ext]

Example:
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.html

or:

resource:///README.txt%00.html

More filetypes:

file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.html
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.js
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.pdf
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.doc
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.xls
probably every filetype.

Oh and: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/firefox.exe%00.xpi :)

This could lead to various exploits to name a few:

- Dossing a user the above example does it almost.
- Code execution
- File access
- Trojan activation
- Virus activation
- Reflective Cross Site Scripting (RXSS)
- Cross Site Request Forgeries (CSRF)

Another example
It is possible to turn regular .txt stored files into full Javascript html zombies:
file:///[filelocation]/troy.txt%00.html

troy.txt could contain:

/*
Bunch of malicious Javascript
*/

Or:






Well I guess you get the point: nasty.

Incompletely reduced TenFourFox test case (does not fail on Firefox 5 yet)

Per Luke's request in bug 636296 comment 29. To recapitulate I am tracking a TenFourFox bug where the number of arguments in the argsobj is sometimes a ridiculously high number causing malloc() in NewArguments() to fail. The large number after analysis seemed to have come from args.nactual in jsinterpinlines.h. This problem did not occur in Mozilla 2.0 leading me to suspect bug 636296 part 4 because that part reduced the number of situations where that value was updated. Our current wallpaper is this

which does work but seems wrong. Is there blindly a better way?

I have attached the test case that we are using but it does not actually fail on Firefox 5 (it is from TED.com). Unfortunately this test case is not completely minimized (the HTML is but I can only get it to trigger with a specific minified Dojo that I am trying to reduce further). However we don't have mjit in TenFourFox only tracejit so it's possible that this is a situation that tracejit doesn't do right. I'm trying to see if I can make it fail with the supported browser.

If this is not a Firefox bug and it might not be is our putative solution correct? Is there a better way?

Firefox on OS X does not respond correctly to the AXPress action. This can be verified directly using the Accessibility Inspector from the Apple develop tools to inspect the close button of a Firefox window.

This is a failure of Firefox 1.5 to integrate itself with the OS X accessibility framework. It will break tools that depend on that framework in order to close Firefox windows. For instance it breaks Witch preference pane app which cannot close a firefox window.  It probably also breaks parts of the routine OS X accessibility support.

"CORE-76209","Style context caches removes elements from the middle of an array","Another fallout of profiling the colour table stress case (the style people must 
begin to hate me. :-) ) is that there is a nsVoidArray that is emptied one 
element at a time which causes alot of memmoves which degrades performance when 
pulling down a big style system.

If I understand it correctly StyleContextImpl's destructor 
calls StyleSetImpl::RemoveStyleContext which removes the style from a cache with 
the following code.

  nsVoidArray *pResults = nsnull
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(GetContexts(aKey&pResults)) && pResults) {
     PRUint32 nCountBefore = Count()
     if (nCountBefore > 0){

RemoveElement is slow since it requires moving at average half the array in 
memory. When done with all elements we get a nice O(n^2) algorithm.

0.5 seconds when leaving the colour table stress case.",121,"1"

I think we should round CSS border widths to the nearest device pixel in the

idea here is that we're solving this problem only for borders and not for
anything else -- since:
 1) for things like widths we want to ensure that 4 * 25% is 100% not a few
pixels less and
 2) we don't want consistency of heights for things handled by (1) since that
creates gaps like in bug 173051.

sample.config cross platform work

In an attempt to clean up the talos configuration world I've come up with this:

- entirely get rid of config.py
- move everything into sample.config
- normalize all paths in sample.config to be workable across platforms (ie a path of 'pageloader/chrome' will be correctly interpreted as 'pageloader\chrome' on windows)
- to handle the different counter options under different platforms created win_counters and unix_counters which are correctly used depending on the system
- add a --debug option and get that out of the config file

So as long as things are installed in the 'standard' locations you should be able to run talos across win/mac/linux using the same sample.config.

   Windows XP Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060815

Description:

On the Suspected Web Forgery popup if you tab out of the warning pop-up window visual focus is completely lost.  This happens when tabbing through the links on the grayed-out web page behind the security warning popup.


Steps to recreate:

1. Make sure the Google anti-phishing security option is set in the Firefox
security options.
    a. Open Firefox Tools Options and open Security page.
    b. Select Tell me if the site I'm using is a suspected forgery checkbox
    c. Select Check by asking [Google] about each site I visit radio button.
2. Open this web page URL in Firefox browser: 
http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html

- This results in the display of the Suspected Web Forgery pop-up.

3. Keep pressing the Tab key several times.  Focus moves to 
- the Get me out of here! button 
- then the Ignore this warning button 
- then the Send report button 
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Location field 
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Search field  
- then... where?  (no obvious visual focus showing anywhere)
- ... keep pressing Tab and eventually program focus returns to the Suspected
Web Forgery popup window links.

- It appears the program focus is tabbing through the links on the grayed-out
web page displayed behind the Suspected Web Forgery popup window.  None of
those focus changes can be seen visually.

Expected results:

1. The visual focus should be clear at all times. even when tabbing through the grayed-out page behind the security warning.  

Often items that are grayed out are not accessible through the keyboard. In this case the user should not be allowed to tab to items in the grayed-out page before a selection is made on the anti-phishing warning popup.",455,"1"

The first page loads fine but when it's about time for the refresh the
browser crashes.  This happens for both a debug and an optimized build.

The crash does not cause a core dump so I can't get a backtrace.  My gdb
is also acting up (it's complaining about a ptrace failure when the first
thread splits off) so I can't run it under a debugger either.

I'm running MkLinux (a PPC-based Linux implementation) on a Mac 8500/150.

Sure --- I've promised strict mode and breakpad CFI at the moment but once those are in the clear this would be satisfying to do.  But it's filed as a bug now so anyone with gumption should grab it.

---

The bigger cleanup I kept refraining from doing in the upvar2 work to keep the
patch only insanely big instead of super-insanely big is to get rid of almost
all the parameters to jsparse.cpp functions making most of them methods of
JSCompiler. This should speed up the recursive-descent parser.

Beyond this there are some cleanups to jsscan.h to use C++ canonical style. But
again the JSCompiler wants at least some inline helpers to forward calls on
itself to its tokenStream member to save typing and shorten lines full of
redundancy in jsparse.cpp.

To say a bit more all the C static functions that have the JSParser signature:

typedef JSParseNode *
JSParser(JSContext *cx JSTokenStream *ts JSTreeContext *tc)

become JSCompiler methods taking zero args. Any cx uses become free and need to
rename to context -- or better we rename JSCompiler::context -> cx. Similarly
for ts -> &tokenStream mutatis mutandis. The tc param needs to be a top of
tree context stack pointer in JSCompiler but that's easy to do too.

Hope this helps and actually wins. Zero params has to make a difference on
code perf as well as size even if we sometimes load this->cx or whatever. But
a second opinion is welcome.",198,"1"

The home page is still: http://bluweb.com/us/chouser/proj/mozhack/

Out of curiosity does anyone reading this know why the bookmark scheduled alert

When editing rich text in Gmail and typing characters with accents (such as √° or √º) on keyboards that require two keystrokes to do so (such as Dutch or U.S.) typing the accent mark starts find-as-you-type. This is really annoying as it can cause you to overwrite text you've just written (since find-as-you-type selects it) or make the text editing field lose focus (depending on the circumstances).

The second two are easy tweaks to make it check out to the right dir and also to include the version number in the checkout path so it will work properly in the face of updated sources.

I also think given how the CVSROOT thing worked out that we should allow specifying the CVSROOT to use via environment variable so that we can get a solution that doesn't require touching srcsrv.ini. We can just see if SRCSRV_ROOT is set in the environment and use that instead of whatever we find from CVS/Root. That way we can just specify it in the mozconfig and everything works.

1. Name clashes

We could quite easily get name clashes with existing attributes depending on
what element the current interface is exposed on. If somebody extends an already
existing input control there is a good chance that .value already exists. The
could also apply to f.x. isReadonly.

2. Using attributes

If somebody wants to implement the controls in pure javascript I've been told
that some browsers do not let you watch attribute changes so it would not be
possibly to implement .value.

To fix problem 2) we need to only use functions. To fix problem 1) I have two
possible solutions:
A) Use a context object like canvas does. That is have one
.getXFormsAccessors() function that returns a new object where the above
interface is implemented.

B) Prefix every function with f.x. form. So we would have .formIsReadonly().

I like A) best but the problem is that when I tried to implement it I hit some

I have a Thawte Personal Freemail certificate which has a certificate chain consisting of three certificates:

Thawte Personal Freemail CA (serial number 0x00)
  Thawte Personal Freemail Issuing CA (serial number 0x0D)
    Thawte Freemail Member (my cert serial 0xFCB65)

When I send a signed or signed/encrypted email the sent email does not contain the full certificate chain as it should -- instead it contains two copies of my cert (serial number 0xFCB65) and one copy of the Issuing CA cert (serial number 0x0D).

This has been reproduced with the nightly build 

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/nightly/2006-09-25-06-trunk/thunderbird-3.0a1.en-US.win32.zip

as well as the release versions of Thunderbird 1.5.0.7 on Linux Fedora Core 5 and 1.5.0.5 on Windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send yourself a signed email or a signed/encrypted email.
2. Save email to disk via Save as.
3. Use OpenSSL to verify the certificate contents:

For a signed-only email:

openssl smime -in email.eml -pk7out | openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -text -noout | grep -A 3 ^Certificate

For a signed/encrypted email first decrypt using

openssl smime -decrypt -in email.eml -recip mycert.pem -inkey mykey.pem
Actual Results:  
The cert with serial 0xFCB65 (mine) is included twice and the root cert with serial 0x0 is not included at all.

        Version: 3 (0x2)

"THUNDERBIRD-476836","(Activity Manager) %s should be added in plural-form messages","This a bug is related to plural-form messages especially those located in Activity Manager.

In Arabic locale (I don't know if this applies on other locales too) for some numbers (precisely for n = 0 1 or 2) the noun that succeeds the number doesn't need any preceding number because the meaning of the number is within the noun it self i.e. if you're saying 'two-days' (it is one word in Arabic) it makes a bit non-sense to say '2 two-days'. In order to solve that if we have a plural message (let's say '%s days') '%s' is removed for entries where n = 0 1 or 2.

Now the problem is that many plural messages doesn't contain a '%s' within (e.g. 'days=daydays' in mail/chrome/messenger/activity.properties) which means that the '%s' is externally added and the localizer can't remove the '%s' for n=012.

My request is to unify the structure of localized plural messages and make sure that all of them become as 'days=%s day%s days' instead of 'days=daydays'.


Besides some other messages need to have the plural-form too (like 'autoRetry=Trying again in %S seconds' in the same file).


Note: That bug is *not* related to the plural-form rules but to the format of plural messages.

Detailed Steps to Reproduce the Problem:  

1.	Install Windows 7
2.	Install Firefox from www.firefox.com
3.	Launch Firefox
4.	Dock it to the right of the screen using mouse 
5.	Minimize Firefox (using the minimize button or Winkey + M)

Note:  This behavior is not consistent with other Internet Browsers: Internet Explorer.

Tester/Developer Notes: 

Firefox was installed on a machine and launched.  The size of the window of Firefox was adjusted using the WinKey +M and then re-sized using the icon on the Superbar however Firefox did not resume it original position on the screen.

Al's Note: I don't see the Superbar (just gadgets) in the public build of Windows 7 so I was unable to verify this bug. Marking this for 1.9.1 by default but we should find out what version of Firefox was used and if we can get access to a more current Windows 7 build.",113,"1"

since aScheme seems to be an in parameter it should be const. but the scheme

"CORE-139243","xpconnect should not do JS rooting for wrapped natives","bug 112152 talks about improving threadsafety for wrapped JS objects and getting
rid of JS rooting there. That is kind of tough. But we can pretty easily kill
the need to do refcount based calls to add and remove JS roots for wrapped

Instead of rooting we can do timely marking. This is better because it avoids
the lock overhead inherent in the JS rooting call. And it only happens at GC
time rather than each time the refcount on the wrapped natives makes a 1->2 or
2->1 transition.

We might see some measureable improvement in DOM manipulation benchmarks.

The Image Properties Window does not tell what type of image it is.  This can be
a problem when checking the images on bugzilla.

For example:
Go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view
Right click on the image and select properties.
Using the properties window there is no valid way to determine what type of
image it is (aka gif png bmp etc...)  You will notice the location field has
the value http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view 
Because of this you cannot determine the type from the URL of the image.

Thus for cases like this either an Image Type: or a Type: or a File Type
field would be useful to indicate what type of image it is.

----------------------
Here's one suggested layout of where to place the new field:

Location:
Width:
Height:
Size of File:
File Type:
Alternatate text:

---------------------
A suggested formatting of the File Type value could be as follows (note it is
similar to the Size of File field).

EXTENSION (Description)
GIF (Graphics Interlaced Format)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
BMP (Bitmap)
JPGJPEG (Joint Photographic ? Group?)

Searching a website (like google) with the search sidebar yields results.  The
sidebar has a next button that shows the next results.  Say you push it until
the results shown are numbers 61-80.  Now you do another search from the
sidebar and it shows results 1-20.  If you push next it SHOULD show you numbers
21-40 however it shows you numbers 81-100.  The count should be reset with each
new search.

1.Search using google in the search sidebar for boogers
2.Press next
3.Search using google in the search sidebar for boogers are nice to eat
4.Press next

Expected Results:  It should have shown pages 21-50 according to the google.src

The HTTP ACCEPT header is not preserved when after a GET redirect. That leads that the second GET is not using the original HTTP ACCEPT header but is reset to the standard.

This is a really important feature for the proper implementation of RESTful architectures. I'm currently developing some RESTful prototypes and this feature is a must when dealing with aliasing of resources for instance in order to access resources by their ID or any other resource key field (as its unique name). The problem is that the http accept header in particular is very important to determine the proper format to de-reference to the resource to (as when using Ruby on Rails respond_to in order to determine the content-type to respond with).

Draft patch requiring feedback for further progress:

- js_FunctionClass doesn't have any JSSLOT_* values which is odd
  because it has JSCLASS_IS_PRIVATE|JSCLASS_HAS_RESERVED_SLOTS(2).  Is this
  an XPConnect thing?  I see this comment:

    /*
     * Reserve two slots in all function objects for XPConnect.  Note that
     * this does not bloat every instance only those on which reserved slots
     * are set and those on which ad-hoc properties are defined.

- The following function names are based on the equivalent functions for
  Arrays.  Better names should be used but I don't know what they are because
  I'm still not sure what the dslots hold for Function and Call objects.

  getFunctionCapacity()
  addressOfFunctionElement()
  setFunctionElement()
  getFunctionElements() // are the elements upvars?  what are upvars?

  getCallCapacity()
  getCallElements()     // getCallArgsAndVars()?

- For js_ArgumentsClass we have getters/setters with names like
  getArgsLength().  I wonder if that should become getArgumentsLength().  The
  rationale would be that we use the full Arguments when talking about the

  non-Arguments arguments (eg. getCallArgsAndVars() if we go with that name).",448,"1"

TESTCASE: Recursive embedding

I was playing around with Gran Paradiso 3.0a6rc2 and discovered a something
about how Firefox deals with embedding that related to this bug:

You can typically only have 2 levels of embedding (ie. an iframe in an iframe).
 This seems to be the case with   and .  However if
you have an  that points to the original document and has a 1px border
Firefox will get caught in a recursive loop and bloat until the user decides to
force quit or the system can no longer take the load.

Here is the offending tag that causes the recursion assuming the containing
document is called index.html:


The results I experienced on my system were that firefox took 50% of my cpu
usage (100% of 1 core) and bloated to 350MB after about 30 minutes of watching
task manager before I got bored and forced quit.  Firefox probably would have
been more than happy to munch away at more of my ram had I not stopped it.

Note:  This only affects Firefox 3.0-based builds as far as I can tell. 
Firefox 2.0.0.4 only allows for a single level of recursion (ie. one layer of
embedding within the parent layer of embedding).  I saw this on both GP 3.0a6
rc2 and the latest nightly trunk from June 29 2007.

I have attached a test case that simulates what I saw.  The test case cannot be run through bugzilla.  It must be saved and run locally.  Alternatively you can copy the following code into an empty file called testcase.html and run it that way.

v1 + mixed content tests reenable

This is cause for mixed content tests (bug 452401) intermittent failures.

nsDocLoader maps request info by request (nsIRequest) address in its mRequestInfoHash hash table. When a request address get recycled and reused for another request (not unlikely to happen) existing info for already dead request is reused.

In nsDocLoader::OnProgress there is a condition 'if (!info->mUploading && (nsInt64(0) == info->mCurrentProgress) && (nsInt64(0) == info->mMaxProgress))' that have to pass only when we get the first OnProgress notify from a request (i.e. when progress of a request is 0) to prevent multiple StateChange notifications to upper levels. 

When existing request info is reused the condition doesn't pass even ones.

This OnProgress notification is critical for the security UI. When it doesn't get it for a request that request got ignored by security UI and we may occasionally get fully secure state for actual mixed content page.

Solution is to remove the request info from the hash table when we get OnStopRequest.",39,"1"

When a download is completed Camino should post a Growl
notification. If you register the notifications
then the UI for turning it on and off and customizing it is in Growl.

1) This can be done without any new UI in Camino.
2) It's not slow.

Bug #282185 applies to Firefox.

"CORE-337723","Use of non-scriptable interfaces in scriptable interfaces","While trying to use xpidl for generating Java interfaces for JavaXPCOM I ran into issues where scriptable interfaces inherit from or use non-scriptable interfaces.  For JavaXPCOM I only expose scriptable interfaces (exceptions made for nsIAppShell).  But this makes it very hard when using xpidl since it doesn't always know whether a given interface is scriptable.

For now I get around this by generating the Java interfaces with a utility based around nsIInterfaceInfoManager which has all the information to determine how to write out all interfaces.  But using xpidl would be more ideal (bug 333618) so it would be good to fix these interfaces.

Here is the current list of grievances:

* imgIDecoderObserver inherits from non-scriptable imgIContainerObserver.
* nsIScriptSecurityManager inherits from non-scriptable nsIXPCSecurityManager.
* nsIWindowCreator2 inherits from non-scriptable nsIWindowCreator.
* An nsIJMVManager method returns non-scriptable nsIPrincipal.

"BUGZILLA-274365","More easy way to search Bugzilla - generic Product/Component and Resolution/Status for search by users","According to Product/Component restructure many duplicate bugs on same problem
but different product could be closed as DUP.
For example many of Thunderbird bugs could be closed as same problem as
mai&news bug because common Product=Core/Component=Mail&News:sub-component was
introduced.
However this has caused other duplicate bugs.
 Many users don't care CORE etc.
 Many users search Product=Thunderbird instead of Product=Core
 if he/she uses Thunderbird.
Bug 274237 is an examle.
> 274237 : If first line of msg is '--' entire message is detected as a sig and
quoting problems are introduced
Many DUPed bugs have similar symptom in summary and this bug could be easily
found as DUP by reporter himself by searching with summary=sig & -- 
if and only if Product=CORE is selected.

A way of generic search is required for non-developer users. 
Next is an example of categorization by bug reporter's point of view instead
developer's view.
 Product-Package-or-Unit:
   Mozilla Browser or Firefox Mail&News or Thunderbird
   Mozilla Composer or Standalone Composer and so on 
 Bug-Status:
   (a) Valid-open(Confirmed Not fixed yet)
   (b) Valid-open-or-DUP ((a) or FIXED-DUP)
   (c) Valid-open-or-DUP-or-fixed ((b) or FIXED-RESOLVED/VERIFIED recently)
   (d) May-valid-or-DUP-or-fixed
       ((c) or UNCONFIRMED or WONTFIX or INVALID recently)
 On search above is expanded to appropriate Product/Component or Relution/Status
 automatically.

Categrization in search is different in each search but predefined
categorization will be useful for initial bug search.
I think it will be a way to reduce duplicate bugs.
(I think (d) in above example is usually required)
It can be pre-defined set of saved search initially and is sufficient for
Browser(Firefox and Mozilla) and Mail(Thundeird and Mozilla) only initially
although HTML/JavaScript/ServerSideScript is better as generic search in future. 

In addition to above pre-defined bug-list heading should be more kind to users.
Since default header is designed for program owner is it not approprite for
initial duplicated bug search(owner name is not needed for user).
My customization example is as follows 
  IDLast Changed DateResolutionStatusCompSummary(full)
Although headers can be easily customized initial setting for non-developer is
preferable because developers have sufficient knowledge on bugzilla but usual
users are usually not and many of bugzilla.mozilla.org users are usual users
bug reporters.

Third some limitation on number of search result is required.
If number of hits is very large it takes very long time in both searching and
listing of results.
This causes frustration of uers. Result listing of 10000 is meaningless for users.
Reporting hit count only is better if number of hits exceeds a limit.
This will also reduce server's workload.",88,"1"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U SunOS sun4u en-US rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20030711

CERT_DecodeGeneralName fails if generalName is EDIPartyName.
Specifically the first call to sec_asn1d_confirm_identifier() fails
because the template has set expect_tag_modifiers to 0x80 while the
found_tag_modifiers are 0xa0.

Within the context of GeneralName EDIPartyName is an implicitly tagged
SEQUENCE. ASN.1 dictates that implicitly tagged types are primitive or
constructed depending on the underlying type. Since the underlying type
is SEQUENCE in this case the implictly tagged type should be constructed.

I think CERT_EDIPartyNameTemplate needs to have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED included
in its kind so that it expects 0xa0 and not 0x80 for tag_modifiers.
[and it continues to expect 0x05 as the tag_number of course]

I have not tried the X400Address but I suspect it has exactly the same
issue since it is also an implicitly tagged SEQUENCE and its template
does not have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED as part of its kind.

I took a look at:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.3/SecurityNssAsn1-11/nssDER/Source/nameTemplates.cpp
and it has both EDIPartyName and X400Address marked as CONSTRUCTED.

I also looked at the test certs that can be gotten to from
http://csrc.nist.gov/pki/testing/x509paths.html
and I couldn't see any obvious test cases which used EDIPartyName

Same thing goes for image dimensions. It is only AFTER you upload the image that you see that your image needs to be a certain width and a certain height.

icon.png should be something recognizably in the style of the theme to let the user quickly pick it out of a list.

Instead judging by old releases we decided to mostly sort-of use new-mail-alert.png and then haven't really. For qute and gnomestripe we use a generic straight-on closed envelope rather than the perspective very older-Qute-styled opened envelope that they use for new-mail-alert.png and for pinstripe we use the Reload button from Firefox 1.5 which is a particularly horrible choice.

We should either redo all three new-mail-alert.pngs so that they are strongly and recognizably in the style of the current themes and use them for all three preview.pngs or decide that they were a bad choice switch to something like the Write icon and switch the preview.pngs.

For the preview.pngs we need to do three things:

* ensure that they are of the current theme not a past version (qute) or another theme (gnomestripe since it's just a copy of qute's)

* ensure that they don't display icons that we plan on removing from the toolbar

* ensure that they don't trip over bug 509242 by making them all less than 220px wide: currently the pinstripe image is particularly badly horizontally compressed",56,"1"

navigator.xul.

Other possibilities: Make the linktoolbar an XPI that can be installed after the
fact or even make it an XPI that can be optionally installed as part of a
mozilla installation (ie a separate component).

I should add that I don't *want* this to happen but I'm filing this bug anyway

stay in just because drivers are so busy that they forgot. If you have a problem

"RELEASE_ENGINEERING-469680","Provide directory link immediately on try submission","There's a very common try server use case that goes:

 - Add a patch to a bug
 - Try server that patch for people to test
 - Once the builds are done comment on the bug with the directory link so that people can fetch that build

What complicates this process is that while the try server is churning on the patch the builds directory ( https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/?C=MO=D ) shows no sign of it.  This means that the submitter has to poll from time to time seeing if there's a directory so that they can comment in the bug and close the loop.  And typically as soon as (say) the Mac build is done they'll scoop up the directory post it in the bug and say something like Builds still underway but they should appear here...  Bugs like bug 430942 are all about this use case.

I suspect that we can know the directory they will land in the second they are submitted.  I propose one of two things:

1) Create the directory immediately.  Yes it may be empty for a while and in the case of a failed build might be permanently empty but so what?  They're cheap they're cleaned up in 30 days and it gives us a live link target right away.

If you have javascript enabled but you have java disabled certain websites can
invoke full java capability via a malicious javascript.  This appears to be
the scheme utilized at the linked URL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Sun JRE 5.0 Update 3
2. Install the latest Deer Park alpha 1 trunk
3. Copy NPJava11.dll NPJava11.dll NPJava12.dll NPJava13.dll NPJava14.dll
NPJava32.dll NPJPI150_03.dll and NPOJI610.dll from C:\Program
Files\Java\jre1.5.0_03\bin to your Deer Park plugins directory
4. Launch Deer Park
5. Under Tools-->Options disable both Javascript and Java
6. Visit http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292455917.html
7. Notice that Java does not launch (i.e. no icon in the XP system tray)
8. Now go back to Tools-->Options and enable only Javascript (you can also
enable but disable common annoyances if you like - it will not make a
difference) but leave Java disabled.
9. Once again visit http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292455917.html
10. This time you should notice that Java has launced because the Java icon
appears in the XP system tray!
Actual Results:  
Firefox preference for Java is circumvented by the website and full-blow Java
support is enabled.

Expected Results:  
No website should be capable of circumventing firefox preferences and enabling
ANY features that the user has intentionally disabled - especially Java!

1. Move argument references into a separate chunk of memory allocated by LirBuffer._allocator (thus guaranteeing same lifetime as LIR).  This makes the LInsC fixed sized.

2. Drop LInsC.argc since it is redundant with CallInfo and not needed for fast traversal of LirBuffer anymore.  For such a small field (4 bits max) its a waste to use up a whole redundant field.

There is also redundancy between the opcode and CallInfo._argtypes but I think that's worth preserving so that the opcode by itself indicates the type of the call result.  (Although one could argue that type checking arguments requires decoding argtypes anwyay).",20,"0"

Build Identifier: 

MenuHelpersX::CreateTruncatedCocoaLabel (in widget/src/cocoa/nsMenuX.mm) will truncate the label text of menus and menuitems if they are above a certain length. They do this via the TruncateThemeText carbon call (deprecated as of OS X 10.5). Apart from being deprecated it appears that this call is unnecessary.

In a xulrunner build I have locally -- the actual app has some menu items with fairly long names especially in some locales -- I've commented out the call to ::TruncateThemeText and cranked the resolution down to see what happens. It seems that Cocoa is smart enough to shorten menuitem labels and menu labels automatically -- via an ellipsis at the end of the label or mid-label -- if working with a screen resolution too small to fit everything in appropriately. No explicit calls to ::TruncateThemeText are necessary and in fact for me they're harmful.

So it seems like CreateTruncatedCocoaLabel could be eliminated and calls made to it replaced with a call that converts the nsString label to an NSString* directly. I don't know enough about upstream dev practices to suggest a patch myself though.

Thanks!

"CORE-95590","FTP: SYST limitations (problems w/ ftp.microsoft.com)","Mozilla should rely very little if at all on the SYST command. SYST 
might be useful but mozilla appears right now to use it only to decide 
how to parse listings and SYST is no good for that.

Consider ftp.microsoft.com. It identifies itself as a Windows NT server
so mozilla would assume a dos-style listing. However the server
actually returns a unix-style listing. Now you can change this server's
list style by issuing a SITE DIRSTYLE command but you have to know that
exists and you have to deal with that command's possible failure. SYST 
isn't very useful here.

One approach is consider a whole bunch of special cases after a SYST. 
This is what lynx does but it's quite complicated. Another approach is 
to ignore SYST entirely. The squid proxy does this.

I rather like the squid way. Analyzing the list results directly seems 
far more robust.

"TOOLKIT-406445","Notification button callback/popup doesn't know which button was clicked","For bug 393120 we want to be able to have to active notificationbox elements each with an active notification each capable of displaying a popup. Our issue is that if you use the popup-based notification directly then the popup has no information at all as to why it is being shown while if you use the callback then although you know which notification's button was pressed you don't know where that button is so that you can't position your popup relative to it.

I've been trying to think of some options. For instance if document.popupNode was set to the button while the popup is being opened then we could use document.getBindingParent to find the notification and notifcationbox. Another possibility is to specify the popup as a XUL element which in our case would be part of our notificationbox xbl. Another idea I had was to clone the popup and append it as a child of the button and use type=menu. I mention this because the popup doesn't behave like a normal menubutton although it resembles one. (I discovered one workaround for this was not to put the popup in a popupset.)

"MAILNEWS_CORE-237095","Wrong token counts when re-training against msgs already marked as junk / not junk","While doing some tests on the new junk mail controls I discovered a problem
with our token accounting which comes up when a user blows away training.dat and
re-trains against good/bad messages that have already been classified. 

Steps:
1) Remove your training.dat and decide you want to retrain. This will become
very common with the new junk controls which perform best if you retrain.

2) Try to retrain your filters against ham and spam that have already been
classified.

We end up calling nsBayesianFilter::observeMessage
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/extensions/bayesian-spam-filter/src/nsBayesianFilter.cpp#787)
which gets the current classification and the new classification provided by the
user when they choose Mark as Junk / Mark as Not Junk for re-training.

This method examines the current classification and removes the tokens for this
message from the appropriate training set. We then add the tokens for the
message to the appropriate training set based on the new classification. 

Consider the case where the old classification == the new classification in
conjunction with a user who has just removed his training.dat file for
retraining. This user selects a bunch of messages already marked as junk and
marks them as junk again for re-training purposes. The first message has its
tokens added to the junk training set. Lets say it contained a word like
'Viagra'. The next junk message first removes itself from the training set. Lets
say this 2nd message also contains the word Viagra. We have one token for viagra
with a token count of one from our first message. By removing the tokens for the
2nd message we end up removing the Viagra token. Then the 2nd message tokens get
added back in. Leaving us with a Viagra token with a total message occurrence
count of 1. But it should be 2!!

Extrapolate this scenario out over the course of retraining against already
classified messages and we'll end up with counts of 1 for any tokens shared
amongst the messages! Oh no!",63,"1"

A decision based on quality isn't I feel limited to QA especially given that webdev and publishers will have a better sense of how ready this is still this bug tracks whether the decision to push into Beta/production has been made.

Test Plan: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Kubla:Test_Plan

As of right now I've completed the URL testing on those listed at: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Kubla:Deployment:UrlsToCheck as well as completed a fair amount of ad-hoc testing.

Remaining items are to:

1) More thoroughly test the publishing side of Kubla itself I appreciate any and all help in testing this as it's a little outside my usual purview as a web-tester.  I can give it a good top-down testing but publishing refinements would likely best originate from the folks who will actually be using this  (This is obviously covered by its Beta period.)
2) Run a link checker that isn't fettered by LDAP auth as Xenu seems to be (clouserw can probably help me with this)
3) Figure out--perhaps on the test plan page itself or just on the Kubla wiki somewhere--what it takes to ship to Beta/production decision-wise how many/what kinds of open bugs will we accept when rolling this out?

I don't really know how we want to track dependencies the query is easy enough (since it's all in the same component) and the bug list small enough that I think we can keep on top by simple queries.

I have a web page I'm trying to view which consists of some invalid HTML.  It is basically a series of several hundred tables with each table containing a couple of other tables.  Some of the  tags are not terminated with a .  This means that eventually the DOM reaches 128 nodes deep (rather than 10-12 as was intended by whoever wrote the code to view the page).  It turns out that Firefox is pruning the DOM at a depth of 128.  The page displays fine in Konqueror and IE but is pruned on Firefox.

This is not likely to be the best way to handle this situation even though I realize this was probably intentional to avoid layouts bringing the browser to its knees.

Perhaps the max number of levels should be raised to 1024 or lifted entirely?  Or child nodes added as siblings beyond a certain depth so that at least the info doesn't actually disappear?

One problem that I can see in the menu code is that keep a
ref to 'gDefaultRootMenu' around which just happens
to be the first menubar we create. However if that menubar
gets destroyed then we delete all its menu items (the
nsMenu code releases its MenuRefs) but we don't remove
those deleted MenuRefs from their parent menu bar In
addition it seems that the parent menu is not holding refs
to submenus (as you might expect).

So the garbage that I am seeing on 9 is related to the

removed from their parent menubar. I verified this by
inserting a new dummy menu into this menu bar.

happen.

where %1 and %2 are substitued for ordinal.name.XXX and day.XXX.name we can only get one form while at least two (or more for languages other than Polish) are needed.

For example:

recurNthWeek=%1$S %2$S miesiaca

for number 1 gives us:

Mon: Pierwszy poniedzialek miesiaca - CORRECT
Tue: Pierwszy wtorek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Wed: Pierwszy sroda miesiaca - INCORRECT (should be: Pierwsza sroda miesiaca)
Thu: Pierwszy czwartek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Fri: Pierwszy piatek miesiaca  - CORRECT
Sat: Pierwszy sobota miesiaca - INCORRECT (should be: Pierwsza sobota miesiaca)
Sun: Pierwszy niedziela miesiaca - INCORRECT (should be: Pierwsza niedziela miesiaca)

Currently if you want to insert an image you have to mouse down and click on don't use alternate text.  I've probably had to do this hundreds of times.  I asked in the forum about was there a way to set this as the default and all I got was nasty flack from someone carrying on about how I disliked blind people and what I wanted violated some standard.

The problem here is that Lightning's iMIP support must move information from the mime parser (an nsISimpleMimeConverter) to the messageWindow UI display. We currently use the ObserverService to implement that. However if the user opens multiple iMIP messages then our calendar information can get associated with the incorrect message window or fail to be associated at all. We could better solve this problem if we had some way to coordinate what messageWindow (or what message) will be displaying the contents of the mime code we are currently parsing.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Lightning (0.3 or higher) onto Thunderbird
2. Email yourself two iMIP messages (ones with Calendar events attached in text/caelndar mime format)
3. Open a second three pane thunderbird window
4. Select both messages and note how Lightning's iMIP bar will show for one window not the other vice versa. 
5. Add the events to your calendars and note that sometimes the event added is not the event that was displayed.

Actual Results:  
iMIP Bar not always displayed
Event to be added to calendar is not the event displayed by the HTML Mime rendering in the message.

Expected Results:  
iMIP bar is always displayed
Correct event is always added to the calendar

There have been several ideas on how to fix this.
1. dmose and mscott talked about using the msgHeaderSink::securityInfo attribute. This attribute would be renamed and changed into a HashArray so that any mime handler could use that as a hook to store valid information that other parts of the code could query and use (in much the same way as SMIME uses it).
2. (Perhaps in addition to step 1) We could also extend nsISimpleMimeConverter so that it has access to the Message URL. From the message URL the nsISimpleMimeConverter could work through the interfaces to get the messageWindow and therefore the msgHeaderSink in order to access this new object described in idea 1. This is also very akin to the way SMIME does this please reference: http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mailnews/mime/src/mimecms.cpp#453 to line 492.",21,"0"

I'm working on a mime content handler (packaged as a thunderbird extension) which needs to call mime_create(content_type hdrs opts).
The problem is that mailnews doesn't expose this method through nsIMimeObjectClassAccess.h

When I statically link mime_s.a with the extenstion I can call mime_create but I get an object that has wrong superclass (children have wrong superclass too).

I have a patch for mailnews module which exposes mime_create().
Would it be possible to integrate it in future thunderbird releases ?

So... Stepping through this in the debugger I see...

case 1...
nsCOMPtr wrapper(dont_AddRef(
    XPCWrappedNative::GetNewOrUsed(ccx cholder aScope iface nsnull)))

This works right. It goes through...

const already_AddRefed
dont_AddRef( T* aRawPtr )

...and... uses the nsCOMPtr ctor:

nsCOMPtr( const already_AddRefed& aSmartPtr )

(where 'T' is XPCWrappedNative).

case 2...
nsCOMPtr wrapper(dont_AddRef(
    XPCWrappedNative::GetNewOrUsed(ccx cholder aScope iface nsnull)))

This does *not* work as expected. It goes through...

const already_AddRefed
dont_AddRef( T* aRawPtr )

...but.. uses the nsCOMPtr ctor:

nsCOMPtr( T* aRawPtr )

So that an *extra* reference is silently added.

I assume it is doing this because the dont_AddRef it typed as 'XPCNativeWrapper' 
but the nsCOMPtr is typed to a class that is a base class of that class but
not an exact match.

Is this something that will only bite in the case where we are dealing with
a return value? If it did this with getter_AddRefs and 'out' pointer then we 
would be in much pain.

Nevertheless this is not pretty.

Especially bad since we are still without understanding why case 1 will not
even build on Mac (when the nsCOMPtr is actually used).

Any insight anyone?

John.

We were finally able to isolate the behavior to a few lines of html and javascript (see the welcome.jsp discussed later). The faulty behavior occurs more often when the complexity of the page increases however the welcome.jsp demonstrates the problem quite well if you let it run for a while. After the welcome.jsp is loaded the javascript will load the return_to_welcome.jsp which is identical but it redirects back to welcome.jsp. When the resource loading goes bad it will throw up an alert saying it cannot find the clock widget. The clock widget is a widget provided by dojo. We are using dojo 0.4.

We added logging to the javascript and this is displayed on the page when resource loading goes bad:

You can run the example at:

http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-ex ... elcome.jsp

If you want I can tar up the war file or even the complete tomcat.

The logging clearly shows that the onLoad event is fired *BEFORE* all the javascript has been loaded. The issue is most easily reproducible on windows (we used both win2k and xp in a VM) but we've also seen it on OSX. However for the example code provided we could only make it happen on windows. All runs fine in FF2 or IE6+. We used a clean FF3 with no plugins.

BTW it is key to use a jsp and *not* static HTML or else the browser figures out that it can cache the entire page and the issue will not surface. Sometimes the issue will issue on the first load sometimes it will take a few minutes..

Another maybe related issue is that we sometimes see that CSS is not loaded. I also actually see this quite often when I go to www.cnn.com with ff3.

BTW in FF2 you can actually see the clock widget on the welcome.jsp not so in ff3.

You can actually see from the bad results (the first set) that the dj_load_init() method is triggerd TWICE before the end of the inline script is run. Looking closely you can see that the DomContentLoaded event and the window onload event both fired prematurely.

In addtion the the dj_load_init() method is only registered as a listener for DomContentLoaded -- not the window.onload event.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
We found the smallest amount of html/javascript that still demonstrates the behavior to make it easier to understand the issue. The downside is that it happens less frequently. To reproduce just load up 
http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-examples/ff3/welcome.jsp
and see it alternating between this page and the return_to_welcome.jsp page. 

After a while an alert pops up saying Could not find Clock!!! This is when the onLoad event has fired prematurely.

Actual Results:  
You get the alert and our logging output appears on the screen

The problem seems to be most prevalent on windows. We can send you server side code on request.

This issue is causing major havoc on our site which is heavily web2.0. And when the javascript loading breaks it leaves the site pretty much broken. We see this issue in ff3 only (tested ff2+ IE6/7 Safari).

If a select form field is resized to 1 using javascript then resized to >1 it
does not expand the select box size correctly (it still behaves as a pull-down).

On the other hand if the select form field is resized to 5 using javascript
first it expands the select box correctly (and it while thereafter regardless
of being resized to 1 later).

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the test URL.

The title says it all really. It appears that sorting Firefox extensions by
popularity yields results based on downloads per week. I can see no good reason
for this. The listings would be far more stable if total downloads were used as
the metric. (I would imagine that for most extensions download numbers do not
increase linearly with time and so we have extensions significantly jumping
about from day to day.)

On a related note the use of the word popular is slightly ambiguous because
it is not explitly clear what it refers to on u.m.o. It should be clarified that
it refers to download numbers.

This suggestion isn't strictly correct since T61 actually uses escape sequences

We should:
  1. Allow T61String to be treated as ISO8859-1 (optionally?)

confirm by clicking Continue which I did.  On the next web page I clicked the
radio button that allowed me to view a diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft
and cutter head.

A popup window was displayed with the message:  Click here to get plugin 

So I clicked as directed to start installing the Java 2 plugin for Windows.

The installation ran to completion.  Afterward I once again tried to view the
diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  I exited Mozilla and restarted the
browser at which point I received an audible bell and an error message about
needing to restart to allow something to complete installation.  So I rebooted
my computer and restarted Mozilla--no error now.  I revisited www3.sears.com and
tried once more to view the drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  Well obviously the install didn't work.

I viewed the installed Mozilla Plugins (Help -> About Plugins) and noticed that
Mozilla did _not_ list a Java plugin.

However if I open the Windows ME control panel and invoke the Add/Remove
Programs applet I see Java 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition v1.3.0._01
listed as an installed app.

"DIRECTORY-485690","LDAP SSL connections with clientauth sometimes use wrong credentials","Created attachment 369808
Patch v1 for LDAP C SDK

This problem is seen in client programs that use SSL clientauth and that 
use different credentials (client certificates) on different connections 
to the same server during the same process lifetime.  It is also seen in 
programs that use clientauth on some connections to a server but not on 
other connections to the same server during the same process lifetime.  

This is seen most commonly is test clients that are trying to simulate
different users but it may also be seen in servers that are trying to 
replicate different data sets to a remote server with a different client
credential for each different data set.  

The problem is that after one connection has been established between 
the client and the server using some (or no) credential all subsequent
connections to the same server may use the same credential (or same absent
credential) even if the client has called ldapssl_enable_clientauth 
specifying different credentials to be used for each subsequent connection.

Here is an explanation.  SSL remembers (caches) information about 
previously established sessions with remote clients and servers and 
reuses that information from old sessions whenever possible to minimize the 
expensive computational overhead of establishing new sessions with each new
connection.  When a new connection is made if the server says Let's reuse
the session we last used then the most recent session from that socket's
cache will be used even if that previous session was established using 
different credentials than the client now wishes to use.

NSS's SSL client library supports the use of multiple separate named caches 
to allow the sessions associated with one set of credentials to be remembered 
separately from the sessions associated with other sets of credentials.  
So a client program that uses credentials for Alice with some sockets and 
uses credentials for Bob with other sockets can have separate caches for Alice and Bob.  If the connections for Alice are configured to use Alice's 
cache and Bob's connections use Bob's cache all confusion over different 
credentials can be eliminated.  

When a program (or thread) uses a socket for which it has not configured an explicitly named socket then NSS uses a default unnamed cache for that 
socket.  There is only one default unnamed cache.  If multiple threads
trying to act as separate users do not specify explicitly named caches for
their respective users' identities then the separate users will end up 
using a common set of credentials from the common cache resulting in 
confusion.  

It may be reasonable for all LDAP connections that do NOT use client auth 
to share a common cache because each connections that uses no client auth 
typically is (re)authenticated using some other method such as simple name
and password authentication.  But it is not reasonable for client auth 
connections to share a cache with connections that use no client auth.

That is the problem experienced with the LDAP C SDK.  The LDAP C SDK never 
explicitly names a cache to be used with any SSL socket so all SSL sockets
share the common unnamed cache with the resulting identity confusion.  

A named cache is implicitly created the first time its name is configured 
to be used by a socket.  Cache entries have a lifetime after which they 
expire.  When all the cache entries for a named cache have expired the 
cache disappears.  So it's very easy to use named caches.  You just give
the name to the SSL socket before doing the first handshake on that socket
and SSL does the rest.  

I have attempted to modify the LDAP C SDK to do that to configure each 
SSL socket that will be used with a client certificate to use a cache with 
the same name as the nickname of the cert to be used.  I have attached 
to this bug an untested patch that I believe will solve the problem.  

I would like one of the LDAP C SDK cognoscenti (you know who you are :) to 
test this patch and see if it does indeed satisfactorily solve the problem 
for them.",126,"1"

"CORE-505959","ExtractCurrentFrame should not create an imgContainer","Now that bug 753 has landed we have an imgIContainer method ExtractCurrentFrame which creates a new imgIContainer with 1 internal frame sourced from the currently active frame within the original container and cropped to the desired size. This is currently only used by borderImage which more or less just extracts part of the frame calculates some rectangles and coordinates and draws it.

In my decode-on-draw work (bug 435296) I do quite a bit of re-architecting in imgContainer. The design philosophy is that imgContainer should map an encoded image (like a jpeg or png) to decoded frames storing the source data from decode-on-draw or discard-redecode if necessary. This works great most of the time but the one case where it doesn't is ExtractCurrentFrame because there's no source data and no mimetype. The patch currently kludges things to pass in an empty mimetype and do some special handling but this ideally should go away.

Thus I propose that we make a different class called something like imgFrameContainer (anyone have a better name?) which of course also implements imgIContainer and has slimmed down internals for more or less just wrapping a single frame. This separates the two uses and doesn't publicly expose any 'frame-ish' datatype which joe would be against.

I'll probably start work on this soon after bug 435296 lands.

Hi guys

Not sure if it's because of JavaScript or something else but the map does
properly show up on Internet Explorer so I would assume that it should show up
with mozilla right?

It looks like there is much javascript and it could also be that the server
detects a non IE browser and doesn't send the same data. I didn't check that
since I don't have the tools to do it.

The page is in French so if you have some French people working on your team
you may want to ask them to check this out (comments will be in French too in
case you wanted to read them...).

It was present in older versions of Mozilla dissappeared then reappeared when
bug 142986 was solved. That is it exists with RC2 2002051008 but not older
2002050706 build.

If a folder of bookmarks is copied and pasted somewhere else in all the
arborescence of the folder (copy and/or original arborescence) bunches of
separators will be added at the end of the subfolders that originally contained
separators.

I created an attachement in bug 142986 that I'll repost here later. I also gave
there an extreme example: After a few hours of use of Mozilla a folder that
originally had 3 subfolders 11 bookmarks and 2 separators had 510 supplementary
separators at the end.

Only folders that had separators before the copy paste action will present this
issue. This leads to the quick and dirty workaround : delete all you separators
and this bug won't hit you.

 * Project: Webform (third-party module)
 * Versions: 5.x 6.x
 * Date: 2009-June-03
 * Security risk: Moderately critical
 * Exploitable from: Remote
 * Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------

The Webform module provides a node type which is typically used to enable
site visitors to fill in questionnaires contact or request/registration
forms surveys polls or other forms on a Drupal site. When displaying the
results of Webform submissions the module does not properly filter user
entered data leading to a cross-site scripting [1] (XSS) vulnerability on
sites with a specific configuration of input formats that would normally be
safe. Such an attack carried out against a sufficiently privileged user may
lead a malicious user to gain administrator access to the site.
-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED ---------------------------------------------------

 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-2.7
 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.7

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Webform
module there is nothing you need to do.
-------- SOLUTION ------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 5.x upgrade to Webform 5.x-2.7 [2].
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 6.x upgrade to Webform 6.x-2.7 [3].
This affects SFx and QMO

Fewer expensive QI calls in critical places. More direct typing increases code clarity.

Notes:
1. data for both rss summary and web page access is stored in the message body allowing toggling yet body will be smaller.
2. message body size should now be cut in half or more on former web page only feeds unnecessary double storing.
3. iframe src is loaded only when web page mode is selected.
4. remove inline css not the way to do it some comments in Bug 363154 #c28
5. pref added for preferred mode with View - Show Rss Summary checkbox.
6. pref added for opening an rss item (anything with content-base in header actually) in new window or inline on threadpane double click/enter set with Message - Open Rss/News Message radio prefs.
7. an alert is shown when trying to select an unavailable mode for old feed items.

TODO:
1. get per folder pref fz:quickMode from feeds.rdf before using global pref.  ideally Tb should allow adding folder based properties
and support inheritance from parent folders in a simple mechanism but that is beyond this scope.
2. localization .dtd entries.
3. need to figure out how to reset some vars in a new message window if changed in main 3pane.

If I create frames with the DOM API calls and append them to a Frameset they
are not visible.  There are different forms of this problem depending on whether
the file is saved as .html or .xhtml. In a .html file I can cause the frames to
display content if I .setAttribute(cols**) after I append the new frames.
In .xhtml this doesn't work.

message XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected:
. Line Number 181 Column 5: .. (reported 
A greater set of 
- entity definitions in conjunction with 
- script tags with file references
leading to XML mismatched tag message

text is sometimes showing random junk e.g. out of Entity definitions)

looks like a buffer overrun error: vanishing 
- when some Entity declarations killed or 
- scripts wirh external file references are killed

source using xhtml-math-svg/xhtml-math-svg.dtd

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Additional Information is holding a nearly minimum XML file to reproduce
the error
2. start the file NotMismatched.xml (the file checked with W3C so far as
possible is not mismatched and - without SVG - running under firefox)
3. to disappear: take away first or last half of the Entities for greek
uppercase letters or (alternatively) all script tags with external references

Actual Results:

1. XML mismatched tag message often with crazy additional messages

"THUNDERBIRD-474701","gloda global search on toolbar folder display refactoring mega-bug","Falling out of bug 452281.  This will add a new search entry in the the default mail toolbar intended to provide a better search experience than the existing quick search.

The existing quick search could just be reused however it will be easier to add new search entry code specific to the behaviour we want.  Also this will leave the old quick search entry untouched such that people could bring it back.

---

With the removal of several buttons from the default mail toolbar ( bug 474523 ) the new search entry should take up a larger amount of horizontal space.  Likely twice the size of the current quick search entry.  It's placement can be the same as the quick search entry.  The emptytext should describe what the search entry is for.

On the right hand side we should be showing a search icon similar to what firefox uses for it's search input entry.

$emptytext = Search messages ( + keyboard_ accelerator + )

  [ $emptytext                                # ]

When a person enters some search text the search icon should change to be a |> go arrow button that is clickable to start the search this button can be triggered from pressing enter as well.

  [ bugzilla                                 |> ]

In the same space as the go button we should provide a clear button that removes the search terms from the search entry after the search has been performed.

  [ bugzilla                                (x) ]

When a search is started from the main mail tab it will always open a new tab.  This the search entry should always be empty from the main tab.  When in a search results tab changing the search input and searching again does not open the results in a new tab.  (we may want to add in a ctrl-enter command that does this)  If the tab is changed from one search result to another the search entry contents should change to match the tab search parameters.",155,"1"

"NSS-70992","nss 3.2 will not build on BSD/OS 4.2","Here's a set of patches that allows the NSS 3.2 release to be compiled
on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

Thanks for your attention.

"CORE-70489","[BeOS] window objects leak","Current BeOS build leaks many window objects.
I created a patch to fix it.

*** HOW TO REPRODUCE **
Here is the sitiations that the leak occurs.

  Case A1. close a dialog by pushing 'close' or  'ok' button : nsWindow object and
                nsWindowBeOS(=BWindow) always leaks.
  Case A2. close a top-level-window by Selecting Menubar->File->Close : nsWindow 
                object and nsWindowBeOS(=BWindow) always leaks.

Here is some sitiations that the leak NOT occurs.

  Case B1. close a dialog by pushing a tiny box (BeOS specific) on upper-left corner 
                of the dialog window : no leak
  Case B2. close a top-level-window by pushing a tiny box (BeOS specific) on 
                upper-left corner of the window : no leak

#BWindow leak can be viewed by watching threads.

*** CAUSE OF THE LEAK ***
In Case A1&A2 nsWindow object was not deleted because it has a BeOS native object 
which holds a reference count to the nsWindow object. The BeOS native 
object (nsWindowBeOS) inherites nsIWidgetStore which actually ADDREF/RELEASE 
nsWindow object.

*** WHAT I DONE IN THE PATCH ***
What I done is to change nsIWidgetStore not to hold a reference count to nsWindow. 
So the leak will not occur anymore. And nsIWidgetStore should only be used for 
nsWindow's internal object from now on.

*** WHAT I DONE IN THE PATCH PART TWO ***
Along with that I modified nsWindowBeOS::QuitRequested() to not return 'true'.
If the function returns 'true' it means that app_server will delete the nsWindowBeOS 
object soon maybe before nsWindow kills it.
I think nsWindowBeOS object should not die where its owner(nsWindow object) 
don't know so nsWindowBeOS should not kill itself by returning 'true' on QuitRequested() 
but tell nsWindow to 'kill me' and wait for a while.

Also I found a leak in nsWindow::DispatchMouseEvent() and fix it.

In any case DS is running into the following case :

They are installing a single CA cert with a nickname of Certificate Manager.
The nickname conflicts with an existing cert of a different subject.

Therefore the CERT_AddTempCertToPerm call fails . However the exported
function CERT_ImportCerts still returns SECSuccess . It even returns a pointer
to a CERTCertificate in my test - but one without a slot set (ie. not a
permanent cert even though keepCerts = PR_TRUE was passed in).

I believe the correct behavior is to return SECFailure in this case. However
there is some added complexity because the function can import more than one
cert. So do we report an error if any cert failed to install in the chain ?

This is defined in XForms 1.1 spec but currently implemented in formsPlayer and XSmiles 1.0 support.  I recommend tht Mozilla also implement this as it is near impossible to define bindings that work with many existing cross-referenced instances.  For example a shopping cart that has an instance that represents the catalog and another that represents the order.  What would be ideal is just to have references to the product in the catalog from the order.  Take for example this bind's calculate:
  <xforms:bind nodeset=items/item/description 
     calculate=instance('inst_catalog')/product[@productId =       
                  current()/../@product]/description />  

This current() function is also implemented for XSLT.

Krishna we'll need your input on this the guidelines for making recommendations are on http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_web_services_guidelines. Following that is a reach out by the evangelism team to try to get the vendor to support protocol handlers.

Once that happens Axel will take over in reviewing the actual implementation which will need to change the gecko.handlerService.* entries in te/browser/chrome/browser-region/region.properties.

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 2.0.0.9

This has happened multiple times now:  The same message appears twice in my inbox (inbox on IMAP server not local inbox).  Also some messages don't appear in my inbox but if I do a Search the Search does find the message and says it is in the inbox but then if I go to the inbox it definitely does not appear in the list.

I know this is a bug because if I use Rebuild Index on the inbox folder the duplicates disappear and the messages failing to appear then appear.  Rebuild Index fixes the problem... until it happens again some time later.

I am using IMAP and I am keeping the messages on the IMAP server so that I can access them from 2 different computers (both using Thunderbird).   I have the Offline Messages option enabled for all folders.   This combination of IMAP and Offline Messages is probably where the bug is -- I imagine this bug doesn't occur if using POP.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce this bug I expect that you must be doing what I am:  using IMAP and leaving the messages on the server (NOT downloading them to your local inbox folder).  i.e. the bug occurs with the inbox folder on the IMAP server and probably not with the local inbox folder.   Also I have the Offline Messages thing enabled for all folders that is probably also required to reproduce this bug.
Actual Results:  
Messages appearing twice in the list in inbox and some messages not appearing at all but discoverable via Search.

Right now if an xpcshell unit tests hangs (and this is not at all uncommon if you're writing/debugging necko/httpd tests) runxpcshelltests.py just sits there and if you control-C it it drops dead.   One side-effect of this is that you do not get to see ANY stdout/stderr from the test so you have no idea where the test is hanging.

I'm attaching a patch that makes runxpcshelltests.py propagate SIGINT to the unit test being run so that we now get the stdout/stderr up to the point where the program hung (in the logfile at least: IMHO it would also be nice if runxpcshelltests either dumped stderr/stdout if a test fails or at least printed out the location of the log file which one now has to wade through the source to discover.

this was tested on moz 0.9.8 but it's my understanding that it exists in later
builds too: some languages (hebrew arabic and others) are written right to
left so the command 

windowdialogwizardpage {
direction: rtl
 }

needs to be added to the file intl.css in the folder locale/ab-CD/global in the
language pack ab-CD.jar file (ab-CD replaced with the language and country codes
of course). this causes the interface to be aligned to the right when the pack
is activated. 

problem: columns content like the columns in the mail/news client or the
address book or the bookmarks manager remaine aligned to the left with their
content positioned as if the UI is still aligned to the left with only the
column headers aligned to the right. e.g.: in the mail client the subject
header is at the right but the subject column is at the left.

expected result: columns should flip order and be aligned to the right like the
headers.

 * Vulnerability: Cross site scripting

------------DESCRIPTION------------

The Content Construction Kit (CCK) allows certain privileged users to add
custom fields to content types using a web browser.

Some field labels and content-type names are displayed without appropriate
filtering in the administrative interface. Malicious users with the administer
content permission are able to exploit this issue and insert arbitrary HTML and
script code into pages. Such a cross site scripting attack (XSS) may lead to the
malicious user gaining full administrative access.

This is only an issue if you need any role separation between administrators
and users with the administer content permission.

------------VERSIONS AFFECTED------------

 * CCK for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-1.10

 * CCK for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.0 (including all RC releases)

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed CCK module
there is nothing you need to do.

------------SOLUTION------------

Install the latest version:

 * For Drupal 5.x install CCK 5.x-1.10 [ http://drupal.org/node/330570 ]

 * For Drupal 6.x install CCK 6.x-2.0 [ http://drupal.org/node/330573 ]

See also the CCK project page [ http://drupal.org/project/cck ].

------------REPORTED BY------------

Info from kin:

A quick look in lxr leads me to believe that your little code snippet assumes
that 'document' is a XUL Document. You guys aren't using XUL in the embedding
world right?

It looks like an nsXULCommandDispatcher is automatically created in the Init()
method of all nsXULDocuments which I believe is what you get when you do a
document.commandDispatcher ...  and nsXULCommandDispatcher defines methods for
getting/setting the focused element (document.commandDispatcher.focusedElement)

the nsPIDOMWindow interface.

This is a Firefox spinoff of the SeaMonkey bug 196871.

When right-clicking a link to a file (such as one of the files on the page I
supplied in the URL field) and choosing Save Link to Disk Firefox does not send
the current page as the referrer as it does when clicking the link normally.
This is a problem on sites such as the one linked to since they perform a check
on the referrer to make sure it is coming from within their own site. In this
case Firefox downloads an HTML error message rather than the real file.

The API change in bug 170722 lets us send a referrer when saving a file and we
should leverage that in Firefox. I have a patch.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a site that authenticates downloads based on the HTTP referrer.
2. Right click a link Save Link to Disk.

# patch -p0 -R -i testopia/patch-3.0
# wget testopia-2.0.tar.gz
# tar xzvf testopia-2.0.tar.gz

instead of being blocked as an invalid IDN. Although this character has dodgy space-like rendering in the current Mozilla rendering code and is therefore a display-spoofing risk it is neither ignored nor prohibited in the current NAMEPREP rules designed to prevent these problems since the ignore/exclude lists in NAMEPREP do not address characters not in Unicode 3.2.  

Fortunately this particular character is currently caught be the hand-rolled ad-hoc IDN dodgy-display-character blacklist and is displayed as Punycode. However it would be better if the IDN code was strictly RFC-compliant with regard to characters not in Unicode 3.2 and that this name was thus treated as invalid during the IDN processing removing the need to catch it as a special case at display time.

Although this particular case is not a serious security problem _in itself_ it does suggest that the current IDN processing code is still not watertight and therefore that there may be other unknown IDN spoofing or other security problems lurking which are still not addressed by the current code.",3731,"1"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 fr rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

We have developed an XPCOM Add-On which is being used by many of our customers
for some while now. Our component uses the ‚ÄúnsIXMLHttpRequest‚Äù object to upload a certain amount of data using POST method.

Since NS_XMLHTTPREQUEST_CONTRACTID has changed with Firefox 3 calls to do_CreateInstance were not working anymore with Gecko SDK 1.8 (our pointer was NULL and error the code was NS_ERROR_NO_INTERFACE).

So we upgraded to latest version (gecko sdk 1.9 built from the official firefox 3 source code). Everything seems ok since we are now able to instanciate successfully our object in Firefox 3.
Yet as soon as call OpenRequest method of that object we get an error.

Here is what the code looks like:

 nsCOMPtr pXMLHttpRequest = NULL
 ...
 pXMLHttpRequest = do_CreateInstance(NS_XMLHTTPREQUEST_CONTRACTID 

 ... (here we just check that rv is OK)

 const nsAString
 nsDependentCString	myUrl = nsDependentCString(url)
 const nsDependentCString
 rv = pXMLHttpRequest->OpenRequest(myPostString myUrl PR_FALSE emptyStr emptyStr)
 ...

We can compile and run this code but when we call OpenRequest() rv is set to 0xc1f30001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED) and we're not able anymore to send any data.
Yet the result of do_CreateInstance() looks OK and our url (char *) is correctly initialized (it is printed in a logfile a few lines earlier).

Moreover we made a simple test by calling Abort() method which returns with no error so we assume pXMLHttpRequest is a valid pointer.

This code was working with Firefox 2. Is it a regression ?

Thanks in advance

"CORE-370952","Fix the reflow functions in nsPresShell","The current system of having four different ways to enter frame reflow (including three which as almost identical) is completely ridiculous.

There should be one path to reflow frames and insert content.  That path should deal with all special cases.

InitialReflow is bad because it assumes there will be a root content node when it is called and breaks if there isn't (for example bug 370812). All the things it needs to do should be moved elsewhere.  (We might need some sort of to replace some calls to InitialReflow().)

Proposed changes:

In general all reflows should go through ProcessReflowCommands.

The following are the changes needed to make all reflows go through ProcessReflowCommands.

Fixing InitialReflow:
1. The root frame (the viewport) is constructed upon initialization of the PresShell.
2. The frame constructor should deal with any special frame construction handling needed for inserting/removing the root content of the document.
3. The frame constructor should notify the presshell when it creates a root scroll frame so that the presshell can register the appropriate listeners.
4. Content notifications shouldn't be suppressed before the initial reflow.
5. Reflow requests shouldn't be suppressed before the initial reflow.
6. The frame constructor should notify the presshell the first time it costructs a non-root frame so that the presshell can start the paint suppression timer.
OR
6. The content sink should notify the presshell at some point during the document load.
7. nsDocumentViewer should unconditionally SetVisibleArea.
8. If there is already a root content node in nsPresShell::Init force frame construction to occur.
9. Replace InitialReflow with a method to start the paint suppression timer.

Essentially the idea is that the initial reflow shouldn't be a special case since there's nothing that makes it fundamentally different from any other reflow.  This part's a bit complicated but I think it's significantly better than what we have now.

Fixing ResizeReflow:
ResizeReflow() simply sets the size of the viewport in the prescontext sets a resize reflow notification on the root frame and possibly flushes reflow.

Fixing StyleChangeReflow:
StyleChangeReflow() simply sets a style change notification on the root frame and possibly flushes reflow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To correct the behaviour of parseIRCURL() the regular expression at line 880 of
the file mentioned above should be changed from: 

        ary = rest.match (/^\/([^\\?\s\/]*)?\/?([^\?]*)?(\?.*)?$/)

to the following: 

        ary = rest.match (/^\/([^\s\cG:]*)?([^\?]*)?(\?.*)?$/)

___________________________________________________________________________


While on the topic of this function it is perhaps also worth changing the
following lines:

887        rv.target = (ary[1]) ? 
888        unescape(ary[1]).toLowerCase().replace(\n \\n): 
889        var params = (ary[2]) ? ary[2].toLowerCase() : 
890        var query = (ary[3]) ? ary[3] : 

to:

887        rv.target = unescape(ary[1]).toLowerCase().replace(\n \\n)
889        var params = ary[2].toLowerCase()
890        var query = ary[3]

If a match isn't made for the contents of capturing brackets then an empty
string is returned. Therefore this change will produce the exact same results
with less code. 

___________________________________________________________________________


Spaces should also not be allowed in a URL so \s characters in lines like the
following should be removed: 

894        rv.isnick =
895            (params.search (/\s*isnick\s*|\s*isnick\s*$/) != -1)

Changing to: 

894        rv.isnick = (params.search (/isnick|isnick$/) != -1)

The same should be done for the regular expressions on lines 904 913 916.

The current RSS Readers in en-US are Bloglines My Yahoo Google.

We want to ship a good set of defaults for Welsh and will work towards that in three stages.

First the localization team and Stas (Stas Malolepszy) will look at the market for the language and come up with a good candidates. Dewy we'll need your input on this the guidelines for making recommendations are on http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_web_services_guidelines. After we decided on a particular RSS reader Stas will contact the owner and ask for permission. undefined we'll likely need your help to at least get the contact information.

Once we have a specification on what the set of RSS readers for Welsh should look like the localization team and Axel will work on an implementation on that. This should happen by the localization team creating and attaching patches for the desired changes and requesting review from Axel. After a successful review the localization team will land them. If you're not feeling comfortable with creating those changes ask Axel to help out.

Please don't commit any modifications in l10n/cy/browser/chrome/browser-region/region.properties to the cvs repository without a patch reviewed by Axel Stas or someone else appointed by Stas/SethB. The data here is sensitive to users and our search partners thus the extra care here.",110,"1"

Suggested placement: under Known Issues. I'm not sure if -remote should be under

linux/unix users who care about it.

Suggested wording (or at least a start):

firefox -remote (mozilla-xremote-client) no longer works on urls containing
commas and is deprecated. Use firefox /url/ instead: it will automatically use
any currently running firefox to open the url according to the tab preferences.
firefox -new-window /url/ will open the url in a new window. There is no

I upgrade from 2.18.4 to Bugzilla 2.20.1 last week and now i have a problem with the new ssl behavior.

We use http/https for connections from intranet and block http via firewall from internet only https is allowed. But we have customers who need to connect with http (didn't accept self signed certificates in proxy configuration) so this customer ip is special configured in the firewall to accept connects with http. 

Until the upgrade all work fine but now i can connect the login page with https and if you submit the login data the submit is send with http that is blocked by the firewall.

I've try parameter sslbase and ssl with several combinations but nothing works. Either it switch at submit from https to http (ssl=never) or i will be redirected to https even if i start the connection with http (ssl=always or auth).

The right behavior for ssl force redirection = never should be that i connect with http and stay at http and if i connect with https i stay at https.

There was a similar bug in 2.16.x if i remember correct.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.connect via https (parameters sslbase=https://bugzilla.mydomain.com/ssl=never)
2.fill out login data and submit

Actual Results:  
get redirected to http

stay at https",1359,"1"

1. This may be the diff information but it's not at all readable.

"TOOLKIT-445049","Preference value types are not validated (or converted) before being set","If you have a preference of type int it allows you to set the value to the string for example if it is on a radiogroup radio buttons only take string values so selecting a radio button will set the preference value to a string rather than int.
I can see this being a problem on radiogroups and menulists but not sure if on anything else.
This probably also affects preferences of different types (bool perhaps) and should look at converting the aValue to the correct type for those ones.",19,"0"

proposed fix

Thunderbird's view-source should also show the status bar (which has nice line numbers and such). Was fixed for seamonkey in bug 401947 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=286885&action=diff

Fixing the terrible indenting while I'm at it (cvsblame is quite useless for the affected code anyways).

We would like to include two new aggregators in our l10n providing a better user-experience since their UI is available in Basque:
- Netvibes[1]
- Alesti[2]

At the moment we have these (in the mentioned order):
1. Bloglines
2. My Yahoo
3. Google Reader

I think this order would be better:
1. Netvibes
2. Alesti
3. Bloglines
4. Google Reader
5. My Yahoo

The first two because they're in Basque and are popularly used. Bloglines is widely used too so I think it's good to have it in third place followed by Google Reader. Yahoo is the less famous one.

Axel has told me we need approval from Alesti --I suppose Netvibes has already given its approval for other cases-- so I've emailed them to info@alesti.org (waiting for an answer).

This is not 100% reproducabe but can almost always be reproduced on the page in the URL field after several reloads.
I could not create a local testcase which would reproduce the problem.

This apparently regressed in 3 stages:
* Until 2006-01-12 everything was fine
* Starting from 2006-01-13 the text became aligned to the left instead of to the right but was still fully visible. A checkin which might be relevat is bug 51767
* Starting from 2006-02-22 (when bug 299065 landed) the text became shifted to the right and partially cut-off.
* Starting from 2006-03-16 (landing of bug 192767 bug 96394 and bug 318116) this also seems to affect the nearby button which is pushed to the next line.

1) A representative of the CA must confirm that all the data in this bug is correct and that the correct certificate(s) have been attached. They must also specify what OS they would like to use to perform the verification below.

2) A Mozilla representative creates a test build of NSS with the new certificate(s) and attaches nssckbi.dll to this bug. A representative of the CA must download this drop it into a copy of Firefox and/or Thunderbird on the OS in question and confirm (by adding a comment here) that the certificate(s) have been correctly imported and that websites work correctly.

3) The Mozilla representative checks the certificate(s) into the NSS store and marks the bug RESOLVED FIXED.

considered to be highly politically incorrect (and even more so everywhere
else). Please please use millimeters instead! I know that Postscript is
horribly rooted on the awful inch (72 pt) internally but please spare the poor
end users from such shameful ignorance about contemporary measurements. Don't
export Americas failure to introduce the metric system into the rest of the
world. (1 pt = 25.4/72 mm)

Also for the paper size in the same menu you write DIN A4 DIN A3 etc.
DIN is just the name of the German standards body which has specified this
format just like almost any other standards organization on this planet. To make
it culturally a bit more neutral please write ISO A4 ISO A3 etc. instead.
The international paper size system has been specified in the international
standard ISO 216 since at least the early 1970s.

Also considering that ISO A4 is worldwide the most widely used laser printer
format (only the US and Canada use a different format awfully even one that
doesn't enjoy a sqrt(2) width/height ratio) it would seem appropriate to list
ISO A4 at the first position of the paper selection menu and make it the default
setting. After all around 94% of the world population use ISO A4 and only
North Americans haven't learned to appreciate it's advantages yet. Don't punish
the rest for this.

More information on A4 paper:

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html

If you really think that A4 paper and millimeters are too shocking for the
average American then you can make the Flintstone alternatives the default

illustrates this:

Then after that we realized that although we don't need things like tag-body.gif which Composer shows when you enter the Show icons for all HTML tags mode that we don't have  shows tag-anchor.gif even in the normal view so Insert - Named Anchor would have... probably shown a broken image icon or maybe just nothing so we added mail/components/compose/content/icons/tag-anchor.gif.

Then smileys moved to the theme and (here's where my archaeology breaks down) whatever it was that was letting us find editor/content/ things in messenger.jar rather than comm.jar was removed and we went back to packaging all of editor/ui/composer/content/icons/ (or maybe we never changed anywhere other than on the aviary branch) so now we're just jarring up something which nothing can access since there's no .manifest saying to either look for content editor there or to overlay any editor/content/ URI with anything from there.

(Doing some restriction of what composer bits and bobs we package wouldn't be a bad thing but copying the files is the wrong approach: we should either ifdef editor/ui/jar.mn (particularly reasonable given the way we already do ifdef editor/ui/locales/jar.mn) or do what we do with mailnews/jar.mn ifdeffing the whole thing and jarring what we want with absolute paths from a file in mail/ instead.)",6,"0"

patch

The attached patch deCOMtaminates and devirtualizes nsICSSParser.  The COM interface class nsICSSParser becomes a pointer-like wrapper class nsCSSParser which allows us to continue hiding all the implementation details in CSSParserImpl (which still exists but has no virtual methods anymore).  Also responsibility for recycling parser objects now rests with nsCSSParser.cpp rather than nsCSSLoader.cpp.  The bulk of nsCSSParser.cpp did not have to change at all.  The contents of nsCSSLoader.h have been folded into nsCSSLoader.cpp as nothing else needs to see them anymore.

From an external perspective most uses of nsICSSParser change from

   nsCOMPtr cssParser
   rv = cssLoader->GetParserFor(nsnull getter_AddRefs(cssParser))
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)
   rv = cssParser->ParseWhatever(...)
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)
   cssLoader->RecycleParser(cssParser)

to

   nsCSSParser cssParser(cssLoader)
   NS_ENSURE_TRUE(cssParser NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)
   rv = cssParser.ParseWhatever(...)
   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv)

If you don't have a nsICSSLoader object handy you can just construct the parser object with no arguments and it'll still participate in the recycling scheme.",133,"1"

A few theories off the top of my head:
* too many slaves on one master is making Buildbot lose some
* the new vlan is configured in such a way that it's causing this
* the new slaves somehow have a different version of buildbot that's busted in some way

Given that this problem hasn't shown up until the new vlan existed and has only happened on the new slaves it seems likely that it's option #2 or #3. We should do a buildbot version comparison on a few new slaves vs old to look at that possibility and rope in IT to look at the vlan config.",7,"0"

As you all know bug 452610 made CalDAV-sched an user settable option disabled by default.  The problem is that means free/busy lookups are now disabled by default.  This results in a loss of critical functionality.

If we  leave the default setting we no longer get free/busy lookups.  This is something that worked in the previous release (0.8)

OTOH we get free/busy lookups if we enable the caldav scheduling option but we lose the ability to send invitations.  This is because the e-mail invitation is no longer generated and the caldav-sched invitation is not functional for our server (Bedework 3.4.1.1).

I consider this to be a regression since a critical feature (free/busy lookups) is no longer available.

When an automated test needs to temporarily replace a standard XPCOM component
with a mock implementation four steps are required:
 * Preserve the original factory
 * Register the mock factory
 * Unregister the mock factory
 * Restore the original factory

See this implemented in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/tests/browser/browser_bug471962.js#104

Currently there is at least one test that doesn't restore the original factory:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/tests/chrome/test_bug_412360.xul

It would be useful to have a shared component to handle these steps usable
from all the JavaScript-based testing frameworks.

The object would register the factory on construction then unregister it
when its dispose() method is explicitly called. For example:



var mockObject = {
  QueryInterface: function() { ... }
  ...
}

var registerer = new MockObjectRegisterer(mockObject contractID ...)
try {
  ...call the functions that need the mock object...
} finally {

Mozilla loads Usenet group indexfiles (.msf) to memory when browsing group.
Naturally memory load increases amount of how large index is. Unfortunately
Mozilla 'forgets' to unload group indexfile when moving to next group that
results huge memory consumption especially when reading large groups.

In worst case one group indexfile takes ~10MB of diskspace resulting 100MB
memory usage after reading 10 groups. Memory usage returns to normal level only
after *ALL* mozilla windows have been closed. 

As you can see in screenshot mozilla takes ~120MB of memory and ~120MB of VM
after ~10 groups none of them are binarygroups. This bug leads to severe

Hi!

I was trying to setup a bz 2.22 importxml script to receive bugs using sendmail I did this for previous versions one hundred times so I'm sure sendmail configuration was ok and permissions too.

After some debug I isolated the problem to something similar we had before in previous bugzilla versions: the path problem.

Executing importxml with sendmail user (daemon) from the path of bugzilla worked fine but when executed as daemon from any other folder it always failed with this message:
> Can't find param named user_verify_class at 
> /opt/testbugzilla/mozilla/webtools/bugzilla/Bugzilla/Config.pm line 171.

> BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at 
> /opt/testbugzilla/mozilla/webtools/bugzilla/importxml.pl line 78.

After debugging importxml and finding out that the way to setup $::path on importxml.pl was working as expected I went to config.pm to see why the hell config.pm was not knowing his path.

Well the problem is that the parameters are loaded with a loop that iterates over: glob $libpath/Bugzilla/Config/*.pm 
Beign libpath defined at line 55 of Config.pm as .

So this is the fix I found and I suppouse it's a good one for everyone please let me know:

$ diff Bugzilla/Config.pm /tmp/bugzilla-2.22.1/Bugzilla/
5664d55
<
< # Because when bugs are imported libpath . makes impossible for
< # the importxml.pl to load the parameters the next line check if
< # $::path which is defined by importxml exist if so then libpath
< # gets $::path value.

My two cents for the monster :-).

"NSS-201259","NSS_GetClientAuthData does not work with limited usage certs","NSS_GetClientAuthData is the default callback provided by NSS to select a client
authentication certificate. Applications that don't want to write extra code for
client auth can choose to use it. It is unknown how many shipping products use it.
However nearly all of the NSS command-line tools use it.

The problem is that this function searches for client auth certificates by
nickname. It does not check the cert usage. If dual-key certs are deployed
there are multiple certificates matching the nickname. There is a 50% chance
that the callback will pick the encryption cert instead of the SSL client auth cert.

This happened to me while I was developing tests for smartcards - the test
picked the encryption cert on the smartcard and the SSL server refused it
(inadequate key usage).

There are two code paths in this default cert callback :
1) Searches by nickname provided in the void* argument
2) Searches in a list of the nicknames of all user certs that mach the list of
valid CAs provided by the server

Both code paths use PK11_FindCertFromNickname which does not take a usage
therefore they both have this problem.

The fix is to filter certs. The function CERT_FindUserCertByUsage can help for
the first case. In the second case we may need to build a list of certs by
subject and filter by usage ourselves.",1,"0"

I guess in bonsai's case it should be us-ascii http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3023#section-3.1. Different bug though I'd need someone with bonsai knowledge to tell.

bug 258465 Comment #100 Rimas Kudelis  2006-09-25 05:31:07 PDT

Anyone want to try this feed for testing: http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.php ? It
consists of three items and should generate new duplicates every five minutes
(so make sure you update often enough).

The catch here is: Every five minutes the feed changes its HTTP response code
from 200 (OK) to Error 503 (server failure). When simulating a failure it
doesn't present the user with any entries at all and this seems like enough to
trigger the duplication when the entries are back after five minutes.

You can see the colorized sourcecode of the file here:
http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.phps .

bug 258465 Comment #101 Dan Wing  2006-09-25 09:38:48 PDT

I am able to duplicate the problem using the test feed at
http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.php using Thunderbird 1.5.0.7.  I configured a new
RSS News & Blogs account that checks for new articles every 2 minutes and
contains only this test feed.

bug 258465 Comment #102 Magnus Melin  2006-09-25 11:29:22 PDT

I also get duplicate items for that feed (using Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux
i686 en-US rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060925 Thunderbird/2.0b1pre ID:2006092503)

bug 451737 Comment #3 From  Unknown W. Brackets   2008-08-24 14:58:34 PDT 

Well this is because of invalidateItems().  You see how it works is this
step-by-step as I understand:

1. Feed added to Thunderbird.

2. On first check:
   a. every item is parsed.
   b. one by one added to the datastore (with valid and stored arcs.)

3. On next and subsequent checks:
   a. valid is unasserted for each item in datastore.
   b. items are added back into the datastore (by setting valid.)
   c. duplicates are checked for by existance in datastore with stored set.
   d. items that still don't have valid are removed.

So what's happening (easier to reproduce with a feed that alternates between
503/empty and 200/not empty) is that it gets the empty list clears all the
items out:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/thunderbird/source/mail/extensions/newsblog/content/feed-parser.js#117

And then flushes it (3d above.)  Next time it checks its duplicate cache is
entirely empty and so it assumes all items are new.

To fix this I think the following might help:

1. AFAICT Feed seems to expect that a 503 will call onerror instead of onload
but I'm sure it doesn't check the status code.  A good place might be in
onDownloaded or here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mail/extensions/newsblog/content/Feed.js#357

2. The clearing I mentioned (invalidateItems call) happens even if the feed is
entirely empty.  I assume this is done to not store things indefinitely so not
clearing it for an empty feed would help.

3. Feeds can very - they might come from load balanced servers future items
may be removed (bringing back older ones) etc.  It would probably solve *a
lot* of duplication problems to simply do expiration by date (e.g. wait a day
or a week.)  I'm not sure what's best there though... doing it immediately
seems clearly brittle to me.

I thought I'd make this comment in case it helps.  I'm not familiar with the
code really at all but if anyone can confirm my understanding a bit (top
level) I'm happy to submit a patch (just have to figure out mercurial...)

I won't have time to test and write solution #3 above in the next week (I'm a
busy guy like most) but #1 and #2 are very easy.

That'd work for 503 errors and we should probably do it but it won't solve
the problem for other cases of intermittent feed items that don't register an
HTTP failure which I've noticed in a variety of feeds (particularly Google
News ones).

Hmm that seems problematic given that feeds can be legitimately empty.

(In reply to comment #5)
> In other words it never looks at the actual messages to determine uniqueness

Indeed and another solution to this problem might be to also check actual
messages although that has its own problems since users can delete messages
after reading them and we don't want those messages to reappear.  Forumzilla
used to do an additional check like this but I'm not sure it was worth it.

Also reproducible in 20080821225349 Thunderbird/3.0b1pre. The two hints that
the feed fetch is bad are the error response and the feed content having 0

specify what OS they would like to use to perform the verification below.

2) A Mozilla representative creates a test build of NSS with the new

I have an XHTML page with SVG in it which contains a group of image elements.

Via JavaScript a user action triggers an XmlHttpRequest request to a server 
which returns a new group of image elements to be displayed (they are all 
JPEGs).

The result of the request is an SVG document.  The javascript grabs the new 
group of image elements and replaces the existing images group in the DOM 
using replaceChild.

The new image elements appear in the DOM (using DOM Inspector) and I can right 
click on them and see the JPEG's details - but they won't display.  This is 
irrespective of whether I use suspend/unsuspenRedraw or forceRedraw.

See the additional information for the code and sample SVG.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Javascript - send XmlHttpRequest for new group of SVG image elements
2. Convert result into XML node
3. Replace existing image group with new one

Actual Results:  
New images should be displayed on screen

Expected Results:  
New image did not display but were loaded successfully into the DOM

"CORE-493160","Modify nsWaveDecoder to use mozilla::Mutex/CondVar","PRMonitor is dying out so code using it should be upgraded to the new mozilla:: synchronization.  It's probably worthwhile to also substitute a mutex+condvar for the monitor.  There are two main reasons:

 (1) Current code uses nsAutoMonitor.Exit/Enter extensively and these functions have been deprecated.  They're not available on mozilla::MonitorAutoEnter.

 (2) Mutex is non-recursive whereas Monitor is recursive.  This means that when Monitor.Exit() is called there's no guarantee you've actually unlocked it.  For this code that's just asking for a nasty performance bug (or deadlock) and non-recursive acquisition therefore must be an implicit invariant.  Mutex makes this an *explicit* invariant.

I don't mind doing the rewrite as it should hopefully be relatively easy.

I think that all across Silme when working with l10nobjects 'path' is the full path to the file except for the FileClient.write_object class method.

"CORE-408076","out of bounds read in BMP decoder can lead to information disclosure","Full credit goes to Michael Skladnikiewicz who reported this to security@mozilla.org in an email with subject Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11 3.0b2pre and prior Remote Information Disclosure. His initial email is quoted below.
-------------------------------------------

Hi

(credit: Gynvael Coldwind // Vexillium with help from udevd and porneL
(I didn't know about  D))

OK Here is how it goes.

Firefox has a problem in handling 8bit BMP files.
The BMP format has a field in the BITMAPINFOHEADER named biClrUsed the
field says how many colors does the palette contain. If this field is 0
then 256 color pallet is used. When this field is not 0 the palette has
the given number of colors.

Now this is how it goes in Firefox:
1. Firefox allocates 256 * sizeof(RGB) for the palette
2. It copies the biClrUsed colors from the BMP file

Well what is missing is:
1a. memset(pallete 0 256 * sizeof(RGB)
The palette still contains old data from the heap.

Now we take a BMP file sized 256x1x8 with biClrUser = 0 and fill the
bitmap with gradient from 0 to 255:
00 01 02 03 04 05 ... and so on

When displayed the BMP file looks chaotic and in fact it contains the
palette copied to the screen.

Here is where HTML 5.0 comes in and . You can imagine the
rest... But I'll write it anyway. You can create a HTML/javascript that
copies the image from img to a canvas and then gets it data and for
example using a form posts it to some remote server.

This has been tested and it works. There is a PoC exploit in the bottom.

The harvested data contains mainly trash but there are also parts of
other websites parts of java scripts even parts of favorites. Well if
there are also cookies and passwords in heap then they are also reachable.

I've attached also the scripts and the leak.bmp bitmap.

This will be posted on bugtraq as soon as a fixed version of FireFox is
released.

Please check also Thunderbird for this issue (I didn't check).

Best regards
Looking forward to Your reply

Bookmarks sidebar context menu items are disabled after loading bookmark on the backround from the sidebar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground = true so the bookmark is loaded on the backround when it's opened on new tab.
2. Open the bookmarks sidebar and open any bookmark on new tab.
3. Open the context menu for any other bookmark except for the one you just loaded.
Actual Results:  
Menu items items in the context menu are disabled and will remain disabled for all bookmarks until bookmarks sidebar loose it's focus.


On step 3 if you open the context menu for the same bookmark you loaded on step 2 menu items are not initially disabled.",110,"1"
"CORE-326714","GNOME/GTK icon code is extremely slow","N.B.: Most people don't use builds with the code that this bug is complaining about -- it's not enabled in release builds since --disable-gnomeui defaults to doing a configure test for the version and the build machines don't *currently* have that version although that could change in the future.  But it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions.

The GNOME icon code in modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/gtk/ is really really slow.  I've described this on IRC in the past and some people had useful suggestions.  On my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds *per icon*.  This is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has OK and Cancel buttons (since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time).  But it's a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file: URL in any displayed bookmarks -- if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file: URLs in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi-second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open.

Using some printf(!) timing since profiling of things involving X server etc. can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsIconChannel::InitWithGnome seem to be:
 * the call to gnome_icon_lookup typically around 300ms
 * the g_object_unref of the icon theme (odd) typically around 50ms
 * the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot -- sometimes it's almost instantaneous sometimes it's near 50ms sometimes in between

When I brought this up on IRC a bunch of people had suggestions for improving the last part but that's actually not the bulk of the time.

I don't think Mozilla should ship this code in official builds until these problems are resolved.",2,"0"

during the Talkback build and symbol delivery.  The build ID in master.ini is set to -server on the maya builds (which are not using the prebuilt Talkback archive) and the symbols are not uploaded.  The build ID is set correctly on the cb-xserve01 builds (using the prebuilt Talkback archive) but the symbols are not uploaded for those either.

This bug also seems to affect any other trunk build that uses Tinderbox.  I checked Thunderbird on Mac and Linux and those build logs are filled with the same message.

config/build_number no longer exists on the trunk since bug 383167.  Tinderbox' post-mozilla.rel.pl was updated in that bug to be able to pick up the build ID.  However Talkback was never updated and is still looks for config/build_number.  The Talkback Makefile has this line:

FC_BUILD        = $(shell cat $(DEPTH)/config/build_number)

Either the Talkback Makefile should be updated to know where to get the build ID (and new prebuilt packages generated for everyone using them) or (perhaps easier) Tinderbox should be updated to pass the build ID in to Talkback whenever calling any of its Makefiles.  This looks like it would be a matter of adding FC_BUILD overrides on the make command line to:

"CORE-461031","Investigate mobile responsiveness problems caused by not returning to the event loop","Vlad wrote an instrumentation patch to see why Fennec running on VMs has serious responsiveness issues while loading heavy pages such as CNN.com. Part of his patch works by basically doing setTimout(0) and watching to see how long it takes before the setTimeouts fire. On a VM he saw a lot of setTimeouts firing at regular intervals followed by a massive slowdown (on the order of one second).

In a test run he saw the following event being handled:

{BM(44)BM(10)ES(94)BM(103)BM(7)BM(54)BM(18)BM(37)BM(33)BM(11)BM(17)BM(10)BM(21)BM(62)BM(20)BM(16)BM(20)BM(7)BM(40)BM(17)BM(92)RP4(676)-E(0xb1a53de0676)}

To translate: we're calling BuildModel a ton of times during the same event without ever returning to the event loop. The sum of all of the BuildModel calls is quite a lot and could explain the loss of responsiveness.

I realized that what this probably means is that we're executing a script with many calls to document.write() each of which calls into nsParser::BuildModel. In this case the parser won't ever interrupt (and even when it's done parsing we won't get all the way back out to the event loop). We could verify this by adding a printf around nsParser::ResumeParse to make sure that we're not sticking around in ResumeParse forever but actually entering and exiting the parser code.",9,"0"

As the canvas tag is not a standard anyway may I suggest the addition of a drawString method with parameters for font type size and string. 

In order to achieve usability canvas really requires an equivalent prototype method however the established prototype functions take immense amounts of clocktime and significantly (and unnessessarily) slow down the canvas. The current lack of standard in canvas makes it possible to include a drawString method before it is too late thus adding new possibilities to the object.

At least further down in nsXULDocument::OnStreamComplete() there is a call to nsScriptLoader::ShouldExecuteScript() this must be the one preventing me from running a script from file:///.

This does not happend if the user is already in the database (has already logon

At the top of the web page at http://www.kokudzu.com/ is a leaf pattern produced by a GIF file.  The area around the leaves is transparent in the pattern so the background yellow color shows through.  In print preview (with background pattern print enabled) the background yellow is visible through the transparent areas which is as it should be.  When printed the leaves are squashed vertically and the transparent areas print as white instead of yellow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.kokudzu.com/ to view the home page.
2. Do File/Page Setup and make sure Print Background is checked.
3. Do File/Print Preview.  Note that area around leaves at to of page is yellow.
4. Send to printer or print to PDF if you have it.
Actual Results:  
Examine the print and note that the area around the leaves is white and the leaves are squashed to fit inside the border of the title area.

Expected Results:  
The print should match the print preview: Yellow around the leaves unsquashed leaves.

The white-print problem also occurs in IE 7 so the handling of transparent areas must be a general browser problem.

upload {

}

upload[mozType|type=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI] {
  -moz-binding: url('chrome://xforms/content/xforms.xml#xformswidget-upload')

---- CUT ---

Problem is that f.x. range has a lot of datatypes that it supports (see bug 316354). So with our current design we would need a specific binding for each (and would still not support user defined types). That's not a good solution.

This means we need a method to find the primitive datatype that a datatype is derived by restrition from. I've tried to stay at a distance from XML Schema so I do not know 1) if that's possible at all and 2) how expensive that will be.

Assuming that its possible I see two solutions:
1) Continue along the same path and use two attribute to bind via CSS:
A @type (as we do now) and a @baseType. @baseType should then be set to the primitive datatype the @type is derived by restriction from.

2) Have the basetype check in the C++ part of f.x. range
We could then find the basetype and set the @type attribute to that instead or invalid if it's unsupported. A problem could be if somebody wanted to do a range for an abitrary data type (although this is invalid per the spec).

(another solution could be to push the responsability to the UI control but I'm not keen on that)

Assuming that we can figure out the basetype I'm for solution 1).",331,"1"

I have just downloaded latest version of manfield and noticed that it uses different rendering engine for font rendering which actually makes fonts look ugly and difficult to read (see attachments). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Manfield
2. Open i.e. http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/
3. It affects all pages every time.
Actual Results:  
Fonts are rendered incorrectly doesn't look consistent with GNOME.

Expected Results:  
Consistent font rendering - if I like mac os style of font rendering I would like to see Firefox using it too. Version 2.0.0.7 works fine but newest Manfield doesn't.

It's already pretty much too late but I thought you'd like to know about a 
chrome makefile shortcut Bill Law did a while back. It makes listing all the 
chrome files in
the makefile easier. It's optional -- you've been doing it the other way after 
all -- but you have to use at least part of this system to get the manifest.rdf 
stuff right. 

This is all in rules.m(a)k. It's a shortcut is all. So instead of 

install:: 
  $(MAKE_INSTALL) file1 $(DIST)\bin\chrome\$(THEME)\navigator\skin 
  $(MAKE_INSTALL) file2 $(DIST)\bin\chrome\$(THEME)\navigator\skin 

clobber:: 
  $(RM) $(DIST)\bin\chrome\$(THEME)\navigator\skin\file1 
  $(RM) $(DIST)\bin\chrome\$(THEME)\navigator\skin\file2 

You can define the directories and then just list the files maybe like 

CHROME_DIR=$(THEME) 
CHROME_SKIN_DIR=navigator\skin 
CHROME_SKIN = .\file1 .\file2 

it just turns out to be a lot easier (one bother -- you have to prepend .\ to 
each file on the Windows makefile while on the Unix makefile you just use the 
naked file
name). Some people are using this scheme. Most aren't. It'd be better if we all 
used one of course. Personally I've been gravitating toward the CHROME

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5

When Java is not installed on my system the javascript window.java returns an object instead of being undefined.

Also window.java.lang is an object when it should be undefined.

This issue occurs for Firefox 1.5+ on WinXP.

The danger here is that if you then access window.java.lang.System then the javascript interpretor will crash.

In Firefox 1.0 window.java is undefined as expected.

This bug is related to bug # 347587

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall java
2. Have a javascript in your web page that prints out the value of typeof window.java
3.
Actual Results:  
window.java returns an object even though java is not installed

Expected Results:  
window.java should be undefined",280,"1"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9a3pre) Gecko/20070319 Minefield/3.0a3pre

The performance of Array.join() is very poor for large arrays. This can be massively improved by re-defining Array.prototype.join as in the attached test case. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached fastjoin.html in Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Two timings are reported via alert boxes one with the standard join and one with the proposed replacement join. The time for the replacement join is much quicker.

Expected Results:  
Ideally the standard Array.join() operation would be at least as quick as the replacement either by adopting it directly or some equivalent or better approach.

IE6 runs the test case in near zero time - I reckon they must implement Array.join() natively it is fantastically quick.

Firefox normal a.join() is about the same as var str='' for (var n=0n<a.lengthn++) str+=a[n]

This can easily be bettered even at the javascript level using the attached code but is still much slower than IE6. We don't like things that run better in IE (and there are not many of them)...",360,"1"

Running the firefox Bash script on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) crashes with the following error message:

  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security
  Reason: Incompatible library version: Security requires version 9.0.0 or later but libsqlite3.dylib provides version 1.0.0

This is because the shell script alters DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH such that the libsqlite3.dylib file in the Firefox directory takes precedence over the one in /usr/lib and the Firefox version is incompatible with Snow Leopard.

Executing the firefox-bin binary directly does not cause this problem since the default DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is being used.

See http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=432894 for some comments about this.  It affects users trying to start the Profile Manager and Selenium-RC.

mentioning any text on the page or so.
The bug I've found appeared in Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1 only all prior
versions works fine. 
The aim of that page is to provide web access to our University library's
catalogue. When you open the page you'll see the yellow square with several
fields and buttons. There is only one text field (for entering the search
phrase). Enter something there for example physics and press Ok button. In
Mozilla 0.9.9 and earlier versions and Internet Explorer you'll receive a list
of books which titles contains physics. In Mozilla 1.0 RC1 the form submits
new page loads but it contains no books info it's just the same as the page
what you see before submission (pay attention to the text just under the yellow
square in English it should looks like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was:
'. As one can suppose after submitting a form this should be
like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was physics' but in 1.0RC1 we actually
have '0 mathes found. Your query was:  ').
My little test shows that the difference between information sent on submission
in 0.9.9 and 1.0RC1 is that 0.9.9 sends 'ssub1=find' name-value pair when 'Ok'
button is pressed ('Ok' button is actually an image and has an OnClick event
document.forms[0].submit()) but 1.0RC1 does'nt. Maybe a server script
'prim.jsp' relies on this pair and when there is no filed named 'ssub1' in a

When a sidebar (such as bookmarks or history) is active any popup windows

sidebar would normally be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate bookmarks
2. Restart Firebird
3. Go to a site that opens a popup window

Actual Results:  
A spacer is displayed on the left side of the popup window.  This is better than
the old behavior of displaying the whole sidebar but it shouldn't be displaying
anything.

"CORE-334588","fontname and fontsize in printing.properties used inconsistently for header and footer","Steps to reproduce (in en-US and most other locales):

1. Start/restart your browser.
1. Set your default serif font to something very distinctive.
2. Print any document.
3. Print again.

Expected results:
Header and footer stay the same.

Actual results:
The header and footer use Times the first time you print and your default serif font the second time you print.

This would be relatively easy to fix the issue is that the localization is loaded after the font is set.  However I doubt having it localized is actually useful.  Apparently at least a few of the localizations have translated the word serif which almost certainly does not give a useful result.

A list of how CVS locales' fontname differed from the en-US serif (the rest had fontname=serif the default serif font):
de: Uppercased
fi: Translated
he: Translated
hy-AM: Not sure
ko: Not sure
mk: Not sure
pl: Translated
ru: Not sure
sq: Uppercased

In the attached test case an SVG image is contained within a frame with an explicitly-specified frame border. When the image initially renders a spurious horizontal line is present. Scrolling the image causes it to become covered in horizontal lines.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached test.html
2. Click the button Click Me.
3. A popup window appears with two frames in which frame1 contains another Click Me button. click this.
4. An SVG image appears in frame 2.
5. Scroll the image up and down.
Actual Results:  
After step 4 the SVG image has a spurious horizontal line.
After step 5 the SVG image is covered in horizontal lines.


Expected Results:  
The SVG should not have any horizontal lines on it.

Essential to the test case are

(i) Use of a popup window (OK if frameset.html is loaded directly)
(ii) Use of an explicitly-specified frame border (OK with default border)
(iii) Loading the SVG in frame 2 from an on-click event in frame 1 (OK if loaded by specifying src=frame2.html in the frameset).

They can just read the slot directly.  Happily this change does not conflict with Igor's patch in bug 511425.

* In fact I don't think block_{getset}Property can be called except with tinyids so tighten the runtime check for JSVAL_IS_INT(idval) to an assertion.

Hi All

   I install and maintain a lot of Firefox for my customer base.  I carry
multiple extensions and themes with me on a CDROM disk.  

   Currently I have to drag them one at a time into themes and/or extensions
to install them.  If I select multiple files and themes and drag them into
Firefox none of the themes/extension will install correctly. 

    Would you consider fixing this for me?

Many thanks

1) At least one of the refimages used this week has production (not staging) ssh keys on it. We're not sure how this happened but this needs to be fixed as a new unverified slave should not be able to access production systems. (Also this caused last night's testing to fail out in staging because of mismatched keys.)

2) There have been a series of recent changes to ref images for puppet/opsi. Not all of these showed up as expected. Its unclear which ref images have which of these changes.


From talking with Phong it seems there are different copies of the refimages being used for cloning. Phong correct me if I missed anything but as best as I can remember you said there are:

2 x xp talos ref image
2 x vista talos ref image
2 x 10.4 talos ref image
2 x 10.5 talos ref image
2 x 10.5 build/unittest mini ref image
1 x 10.5 build/unittest xserve ref image
1 x linux talos ref image


Phong: 

1) for the refimages where there are multiple copies can you diff to see which ones have out-of-sync versions? If they are identical copies can you bring one online? If you find any diff can you bring *both* online so we can login to both machines figure out whats going on and try to detangle the differences?

2) for any refimages where there is only one copy can you bring it online so we can verify what keys are installed?",13,"0"

I have tried firefox 3.5 final version today. It starts up very very slow(almost morethen two minutes). I have a very powerfull machine at work (Q6600 with 4 GB Ram). HEre is what i have done to resolve the issues

- Cleared all the cache (also from ie just in case as i read somewhere that ie cache can also have an impact on startup)
- disable update check for all three things
- Tried to compact the data base by Vacuum command
and finally when things didnt go well I removed the profile fodler from Documents and settings (removed mozilla folder)
Even after doing all the things above i still have a very slow startup of firefox for the first time(after reboot) subsequent startups are fine (3-4)secs. I have also been experimenting with earlier releases beta 234 rc1 the problem started after beta 4 as far as i can remember.

Sorry I can't find a suitable component/target to report this problem.  So
I just pick 'browser'.

I found under the bin/ directory there're 538 files and 1013 directories.
(I got the mozilla by downloading a daily mozilla-win32.zip and unzip it.)
There must be a lot of empty directories under the bin directory.  Why are
they needed?  Isn't there any better arrangement of the directories?  For
example I found that bin\chrome\classic\skin directory (and all its
subdirectoris) mirrored the directory structure in bin\chrome\classic.jar
but the former are empty.  Are they really needed?

It looks like the result messages of referred operations (child requests) get rebuilt with just the message ID message type errno matched DN and error message.  At that point we lose any server response controls including password policy controls.

Bug 231705 might be referring to this it talks about the page control but I believe it's a more generic issue since the page cookie comes back in a control in the the search result.  But since I haven't tested with the page control I wont assume it's the same.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050409 Firefox/1.0+

In mozilla\toolkit\components\satchel\src\nsFormHistory.cpp:
Line 790: delete (PRUnichar *) matchingValues[i]

but while filling matchingValues with values we actually call:
AppendElement->InsertElementAt:
nsVoidArray.cpp (InsertElementAt):
394   if (oldCount >= GetArraySize())
395   {
396     if (!GrowArrayBy(1))
397       return PR_FALSE
398   }
Then we go to GrowArrayBy which calls nsAutoVoidArray::SizeTo which
calls...nsVoidArray::SizeTo

in nsVoidArray::SizeTo we have:
186     char* bytes = (char *) PR_Realloc(mImplSIZEOF_IMPL(aSize))
-or-
214     char* bytes = (char *) PR_Malloc(SIZEOF_IMPL(aSize))

Which uses malloc and realloc which come from the malloc family after all.

AFAIK this is a very easy fix: just change delete matchingValues[i] to
free(matchingValues[i])

describe the new and removed header files.

1. Two new header files are added in NSS 3.10: pk11pub.h
and pk11priv.h which contain the public and private
functions declared in the original pk11func.h header.
pk11func.h in NSS 3.10 simply includes pk11pub.h and
pk11priv.h.

2. Three headers are removed in NSS 3.10: secutil.h
zconf.h and zlib.h.  These headers are from NSS's
cmd directory and should not have been exported.
Note that the Solaris SUNWtlsd package never exported
these three headers.",818,"1"
"CORE-119335","nsXMLContentSerializer::AppendTextData() causes assertion in nsDependentString::Rebind()","I've been seeing this the last few weeks with a trunk build ...

Sometimes when saving an HTML doc in composer I see several assertions like:

###!!! ASSERTION: nsDependentString must wrap only null-terminated strings: '!*a
EndPtr' file ..\..\dist/include/string\nsDependentString.h line 86
###!!! Break: at file ..\..\dist/include/string\nsDependentString.h line 86

The assertion seems to be triggered by the following code in
nsXMLContentSerializer::AppendTextData():


    if (frag->Is2b()) {
      AppendToString(nsDependentString(frag->Get2b()+aStartOffset length)
                     aStr
                     aTranslateEntities
                     aIncrColumn)
    }
    else {
      AppendToString(NS_ConvertASCIItoUCS2(frag->Get1b()+aStartOffset length)
                     aStr
                     aTranslateEntities
                     aIncrColumn)
    }

The 1b and 2b pointers in the text fragment are not null terminated so you may
want to use something other than a Dependent string or make a local copy of the
fragment contents and null terminate it before using the dependent string.

Here's the partial stack trace that shows how I'm hitting the assertion:

When I use the GoogleBar with the search term highlighting turned on it prints each word of the search query as a button on the toolbar. As these buttons extend beyond the edge of the viewable screen the UI extends in an attempt to fit the extended length. However when the window is maximized this causes the scrollbar to move past the edge of the viewable screen. It also causes problems with divs that have relative placement. They start to bounce between their normal position and the position they would be if the screen were wide enough to hold the entire UI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using a toolbar extension cause the items on the toolbar to overflow
2. Observe how the UI extends past the end of the viewable screen.
3. Watch certain divs begin to bounce.

Actual Results:  
Bad Webpage and UI rendering

Expected Results:  
Toolbar buttons cut off gracefully The UI doesn't extend past the edge of the viewable screen and relatively placed divs don't bounce.

"CORE_GRAVEYARD-402726","Allow to view cert on SSL protocol errors","https://kuix.de:8444/ is a site with the following properties:

- it uses a cert that specifies an OCSP responder
  but you probably can't reach that server
  because it's located inside the Red Hat intranet
  (and it's a test server so it's occasionally down)

- the server will require a client cert or it will reject the 
  connection (I'm sure you don't have a good client cert).


This is a nice test case to trigger a SSL protocol error which produces an error page in Firefox.

When you see the error page do this:
- click the icon left to the URL bad
- click more
- notice that no cert information is shown

Expected behavior:
The server's cert should be shown because it has one.


There are two different test cases which depend on the following preference:
edit/prefs/advanced/encryption/validation/
  When an OCSP server connection fails treat the cert as invalid


Test case A: NOT checked (default)
  Connect to https://kuix.de:8444
  Firefox will allow the connection (OCSP doesn't matter) 
  but the server will reject the connection (no client cert)

Test case B CHECKED
  Connect to https://kuix.de:8444
  Firefox will cancel the connection (OCSP server failure)


It turns out in both test cases page info does not list the cert.
It turns out we need different fixes to make them both work.

To fix B we need a fix to browser's UI code.
The minimal ssl status we provide in such a scenarios does not contain cipher information so some JS code is throwing an exception.

To fix A in addition we must change PSM to always provide the minimal SSL status object even if the ssl cert can be verified because the SSL code may terminate the connection early (because the server disconnects) and therefore our usual place to set the SSL status object will not be reached.",14,"0"

The dirty rect given to the plugin comes from rounding the app-unit dirty rect
out to pixels.  The reason why the app unit dirty rect is not pixel aligned is
because nsDisplayClip::Paint for the nsSubDocumentFrame intersects the
unsnapped clip rect with the dirty rect.

I don't yet know why the dirty rect is larger than the surface when there is
no rotation involved.
 
Perhaps a similar situation may have been possible before the fix for bug
430450 but the rounding out of the dirty rect in that fix makes this
situation much more likely.",4,"0"

According to Margaret Chan if f you are building with debug enabled
then this problem doesn't occur. 

I've done a bit of research on this (and will continue to look at it).

Now if we remove the following from the
...mozilla/security/nss/lib/freebl/Makefile (at about line 164):
 
-ifdef USE_64
-# this builds for Sparc v9a pure 64-bit architecture
-    MPI_SRCS += mpi_sparc.c
-    ASFILES   = mpv_sparcv9.s montmulfv9.s
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY -DMP_USING_MONT_MULF
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_USE_UINT_DIGIT
-#   MPI_SRCS += mpv_sparc.c
-# removed -xdepend from the following line
-    SOLARIS_FLAGS = -fast -xO5 -xrestrict=%all -xchip=ultra -xarch=v9a -KPIC
-mt
-    SOLARIS_AS_FLAGS = -xarch=v9a -K PIC
-else
-# this builds for Sparc v8+a hybrid architecture 64-bit registers 32-bit ABI

-    SOLARIS_AS_FLAGS = -xarch=v8plusa -K PIC
-#   ASM_SUFFIX = .S
-endif

and do:

% gmake clean
% gmake

those symbols are picked up from ...mozilla/security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c

In mpi.c each of the routines for the unresolved symbols is surronded by:

#if !defined(MP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY) 
... 
#endif
 
So if we don't remove those lines from the .../freebl/Makefile then 
MP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY is apparently being defined but the assembly file
isn't. Still investigating this.

Now obviously we would prefer to use the specially crafted assembler 
routine rather than the generic .c routines for performance reasons.",147,"1"

The reason for this is that DropIndexes makes no allowance for the idea that it 
may ever have to drop a PRIMARY key. To do so requires this syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP PRIMARY KEY

Perusal of the code in DropIndexes shows that it can only produce the following 
syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP INDEX PRIMARY

There are two approaches to fixing this: either fix DropIndexes so that it 
handles PRIMARY key drops properly or just add the above line with the correct 
syntax in place of the DropIndexes call. The former is 'better' the latter 
is 'faster'... and at this particular moment with 2.18 release so near speed

We want to ship a good set of defaults for Bulgarian and will work towards that in three stages.

First the localization team and Mic (Michal Berman) will look at the market for the language and come up with a good candidates. Ogi we'll need your input on this the guidelines for making recommendations are on http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_web_services_guidelines. After we decided on a particular RSS reader Mic will contact the owner and ask for permission. undefined we'll likely need your help to at least get the contact information.

Once we have a specification on what the set of RSS readers for Bulgarian should look like the localization team and Axel will work on an implementation on that. This should happen by the localization team creating and attaching patches for the desired changes and requesting review from Axel. After a successful review the localization team will land them. If you're not feeling comfortable with creating those changes ask Axel to help out.

Please don't commit any modifications in l10n/bg/browser/chrome/browser-region/region.properties to the cvs repository without a patch reviewed by Axel or someone else appointed by Mic. The data here is sensitive to users and our search partners thus the extra care here.

We are at present investigating the possibility of deploying Firefox as Internet browser in our organisation.

For such a deployment to be successful we need to be able to control the software's behaviour in a number of aspects. More precisely as for both practical and security reasons we have to be able to control the installed version of the software and its plugins and addons any software update and / or installation has to managed internally and distributed centrally. It should not be possible for a user to bypass this process.

The best solution we could find to block a user from installing unauthorized addons is to modify the fileIsItemPackage(file) function in the nsExtensionManager.js script by removing the xpi and jar extensions. This has the desired result as the addon installation is not proposed even if a xpi file exists in the extensions folder.

However we have noticed that simply copying the directory containing an already installed addon from another computer into the extensions folder results in the addon being available in Firefox without any further action. Normally a standard user will not be able to copy to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\extensions but he does have access to %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d8mn5o2t.default\extensions which has the same effect: 

What measures can you propose to block this taking into account that Firefox's profile manager allows a user to create a new profile and thereby bypass any change in permissions that we could apply to the %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d8mn5o2t.default\extensions  folder?

I look forward to your reply and thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

Leak Log

Thunderbird is just about to have leak and bloat boxes on trunk. At the moment these will definitely go orange due to reference count shutdown leaks within Lightning. These do not occur when just Thunderbird is running.

As when we integrate Thunderbird + Lightning on the builds this will make the tinderboxes go orange I think we should try and fix these.

These occur with a basic profile (no calendars defined on startup) and without actually opening a calendar tab.

More information on the profile and how to run the tests can be found here:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Memory_Bloat_and_Leak_Tests

We may need to investigate trace-malloc leaks as well but seeing as they will be affected by these then I suggest we clear these off first.

There may be some related bugs e.g. Bug 426973 - Sunbird leaking on shutdown but I wanted one specifically for tracking what would block Lightning integrating with TB.

"CORE-14676","dlopen() bug in FreeBSD 3.x causes problems with components also impacts Purify on Solaris.","FreeBSD 3.x has a bug in its implementation of dlopen().  If the same C++ symbol
is exported from multiple libraries opened with dlopen() every library picks up
the version of the symbol present in the *first* library opened with dlopen.
See  for details on this
FreeBSD bug.

This bug naturally wreaks havoc on Mozilla components both bug 6323 and bug
13154 seem to have been due to it though in each case it's been specifically
fixed (or perhaps worked around) by declaring offending symbols static.
However there is enough copy&pasted code in Mozilla that tracking down every
multiply-defined symbol seems an impossible task.  (I don't currently have any
specific behavioral bugs that can be tracked to this though now that these two
bugs have been fixed so QA can probably take a break on this one.)

The behavior of dlopen() has been changed in FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT I think this
is why neither of the above two bugs were apparently present on 4.0-CURRENT
machines.

The correct workaround for this bug I think is to force Mozilla to be compiled
with --enable-low-fat on FreeBSD.  This flag strips all symbols except the four
that are required for components (and are opened with dlsym()) from the
component binaries.

Note that on FreeBSD versions prior to 3.3 (or 4.0-CURRENT) you'll want to
apply the fix described in bug 14241 to --enable-low-fat or dlopen() will spew
huge amounts of debugging information.",209,"1"

Description: when the interface is aligned to the right e.g. when using a RTL
language (like hebrew or arabic) navigating the menues in the main menu of any
component of Mozilla (Navigator Messenger etc.) is reversed. pressing the right
arrow on the keyboard moves to the next menu to the left and pressing the left

1. aligning the interface to the right: add these lines to the file intl.css in
the locale\en-US\global in the en-US.jar file (the language pack file in the
chrome folder):

windowdialogwizardpage {

(1) The tips of the arrows are drawn at an angle that's JUST different than 45 degrees.  This causes some odd antialiasing: at normal size the arrow tips appear to change angle halfway through and the points are a bit thick.  Because there's so little room to define these shapes I'd suggest making the small icons use 45 degree angles for the tips and leave the large icons as-is.
(2) The backs of the arrow stems look chopped off at normal size.  On the large icons these backs have a light column of pixels inside a dark edge that's just a bit lighter than the top/bottom edges.  On the small icons the effect is subtle the light column (especially on the current right arrow) is almost impossible to see as different and the dark column appears noticeably lighter than the top/bottom edges.  Because of this the arrows don't look closed.  I suggest changing the small icons to make the back column of pixels be as dark as the top/bottom rows to make the edge more defined.  Perhaps the light column inside the dark edge could be lightened as well but I'm not as sure on that one.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008050115 Minefield/3.0pre

The XForms 1.1 spec defines several new XPath functions that rely on an 'object' type as a parameter or return value. The intent is to allow the author to pass any of the XPath data types (boolean number string nodeset) as well as return any type. The 'Choose' function is an example: http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#fn-choose

The closet thing to an object is txINodeset since you can get a number string or boolean result from a Nodeset. However txXPCOMExtensionFunctionCall::evaluate looks at the type of the parameter and calls evaluateToNodeset/Boolean/String/etc. If the type of the parameter is declared to be txINodeset but the evaluation results in anything other than a nodeset NS_ERROR_XSLT_NODESET_EXPECTED is returned.

We need another type that can be anything just to get around the checking done by the various EvaluateTo methods. Note that the evaluation happens before the call to the XForms XPath processor so there is no way to work around the issue in the XForms code.

The libpng update seems to have added |#define PNG_NO_WRITE_FILTER| to modules/libimg/png/mozpngconf.h so it looks like this is probably expected if I'm understanding that right.

Our nsIImageEncoder interface doesn't support specifying row filters so this seems fine... I do wonder how the 1/2/2 values were getting set before -- were those the values or were we picking up initialized data?

  I first loop in the childNodes of the tbody and remove some of the rows. The

After talking with joduinn this morning we'd like to hook up Armen's single Win64 builder to production-master and have it build nightly builds on trunk. By doing this we can iterate on the toolchain as required trigger builds as required and generate builds and logs for developers to use as we go.

Making the user font faces available to the pango-provided PangoFcFontMap

between multiple FcConfig's to avoid fonts being used outside the document (or

possible to filter out foreign user font faces between the PangoFcFontMap and
pango_itemize within gfxPangoFontGroup but keeping the faces other users of

A better approach would be to refactor the gfxPangoFontGroup font selection.
Implementing a new PangoFcFontMap would be sufficient to enable user font face

Proposed patch

The strings for title and introduction text for the permission manager dialogs are always taken from mozilla/suite/common/permissions/permissionsManager.properties

While it's convenient for creating the default kinds of dialogs (install popup image) it requires non trivial work to create new permission manager dialogs (for extensions for instance).

Firefox already uses parameters for such dialogs.

As install (extensions) popup image and also cookies use that dialog without requiring parameters and for some internal uses (ones where you can edit permissionsManager.properties and bother localizers) it's convenient for them to be optional it's better to leave it as an optional parameter instead of requiring it as in FX.


I'm not making any other check than SM has today. It is it won't work today if you use another type than popup image or install and it won't work if you specify such type without providing title and text.

Unfortunately I don't have the revised and corrected version of
the standard to hand.

But on p. 5 clause 7.3 of the original GB 18030-2000 it states (in
Chinese):

From 0x90308130 to 0xE339FE39 altogether 1058400 code points correspond
to GB 13000's 16 supplementary planes...

If you look at the ICU specification bFirst=90 30 81 30 and
bLast=E3 32 9A 35 corresponds to:

83 groups (90..E2) of GB 18030:    83 x 10 x 1260 = 1045800 code points
 2 planes (E3 30..31) of GB 18030:       2 x 1260 =    2520 code points
25 rows   (E3 32 81..99) of GB 18030:        25 x 10 =  250 code points
 6 cells  (E3 32 9A 30..35) of GB 18030:                  6 code points
                                             Total    1048576 code points

And 1048576 code points = 16 x 66536 code points = 16 planes of 10646.

So GB 18030 and ICU agree. Start at 0x90308130 and lay out all the
rest of the Unicode supplementary code points in order.

Regardless of what you choose for the timezone preference from the options tab the event dialog creates an event in terms of the OS timezone. This can be a little confusing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set OS to Central time America/Chicago
2. Start Sunbird
3. Go to Options->Timezone Change timezone from America/Cancun to America/Phoenix
4. Create an Event on 5/22/2006 at 4PM in the Event dialog
5. When you click OK the event is saved to the calendar on 5/22/2006 at 2PM. 

If you check timeanddate.com you can see that on 5/22/2006 4PM Central Time == 5/22/2006 2PM Phoenix time.

Actual Results:  
Therefore the event dialog is creating the events in terms of the original OS timezone. 

This can be further verified by leaving the timezone preference set to America/Phoenix and closing sunbird. Change your OS timezone to America/New York start sunbird again and try the test case. Note that the event dialog now interprets your entry as though it is in New York time and converts it to Phoenix time in the views (i.e. the same test case above will cause an event on 5/22/2006 at 1PM to show up on the view).

Expected Results:  
The event dialog should create events with regard to the user's current timezone preference. 

For all verification on this defect I used the month view for display and timeanddate.com to double check the timezone calculations. 

Although this can be fixed by allowing the user the option to pick the timezone of an event from within the Event Dialog I think that even that timezone picker should default to whatever Timezone preference setting the user has currently selected in the options panel.",566,"1"

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.6a1 (20051213) and earlier

Fields in the query string of URIs are meant to be %-escaped. So the following mailto-URL works as expected when passed into TB from a browser (both IE and Mozilla):

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?to=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org and c&d@e.org)

Substituting the to by cc in the query string also still works:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?cc=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with cc to c&d@e.org)

However using bcc in the query string results in trouble:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org

This now gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

In other words TB forgets to unescape the BCC address(es) correctly. Note that leaving the addresses in the query string unescaped is not an option as the unescaped ampersand would prematurely terminate the to/cc/bcc field.  

Outlook behaves correctly in this respect i.e. treats all the above URIs correctly and on the same footing. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure TB as default mail application for IE or Mozilla
2. Enter mailto URL mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org into browser address field or click on a link with this URL 
3. Observe addresses shown in TB mail composer window - the BCC addresses will not be unescaped.

Actual Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

Expected Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c&d@e.org

This was first discovered in TB 1.0.7 but seems to be the same in the current trunk. Both Mozilla and IE were used as the browsers supplying the mailto-URI to TB. Mozilla in cooperation with Outlook handles the URIs correctly. The problem also occurs when the window.location property is set to the said mailto-URL in JavaScript in the browser.

"NSS-422859","libPKIX builds & validates chain to root not in the caller-provided anchor list","This bug was originally reported by Kai Engert in bug 406755 comment 37.

He reports that he called CERT_PKIXVerifyCert passing it a set of one or
more certificates to be used as explicit trust anchors and a policy OID
and a cert from a particular server.

He expected the function call to either 
a) succeed and return a chain that was anchored by one of the roots he 
supplied or 
b) fail
Instead he reports that it succeeded but the root CA cert that it returned
as being the matching trust anchor was NOT one of the certs he had passed 
in to the call but rather was one of NSS's built-in trusted root certs.

So it appears that NSS did not use the caller-supplied list of anchors 
to the exclusion of all the other usual trust anchors but merely in 
addition to the usual trust anchors.  

This is bad news for EV.  

I think we should try to reproduce this with vfychain or vfyserv.  
I will attempt to attach to this bug a zip file containing the certs 
sent by the server in the TLS handshake.  

I don't know exactly how many root CA certs Kai passed to CERT_PKIXVerifyCert
but I believe that one of them was the cert found at 
http://crt.comodoca.com/COMODOCertificationAuthority.crt
and the EV policy OID used with it was 1.3.6.1.4.1.6449.1.2.1.5.1

About the DNS resolve suppose the following case:
1. there are some (more than one) IP addresses which are mapped to the same host
name
2. only some of them is available
3. and only one is the true IP address
4. maybe this depands on what protocol we use...

We should try each IP adress until we find one which works and then remember
that returned address.

Should try them all but add an API to say return only this IP address entry
next time we ask then we return all addresses until we make a choice for some
reason.

That would be sufficient for both requirements: 1. Avoid DNS spoofinng 2. Get a
IP address which works

Note that we may want to cache these results per IP-address+protocol and not
only per IP-address.

v1 make sure event-driven indexing obeys offline requirements

davida sid0 and myself noted gloda getting angry about streaming some messages.  Cursory investigation showed that although the folder indexing logic avoids trying to index messages that are not available offline the event driven indexing code does not have the same qualms.

I am providing a patch that adds this check.  There is obviously some relationship between this change and the recent changes about what folders gloda should be indexing in and this logic should arguably be centralized with that logic more explicitly.  However we are going to drop the offline requirement for beta 2 so I think I can make a strong case for fixing this now and leaving the super elegant code for that change since this code will become moot.",0,"0"

less.dirty.diff

Split out from bug 646359. After some heavy debugging I realized that the reason why the original patch in attachment 495873 had caused bug 654419 was not what I said in bug 646359 comment 1 but that when encountering line breaks in preformatted text in nsBidiPresUtils::TraverseFrames we can create continuations and in that case we need to dirty the line. This is the last hunk of the patch.

On the other hand I think we were dirtying lines too often in ResolveParagraph (which covered up the fact that we weren't doing it when we should) so the rest of the patch moves the dirtying to points where we are changing or creating continuations.

However! the try run https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=4089c3ced4a8 shows that this breaks layout/reftests/text-overflow/xulscroll.html but that seems to be because of a separate bug which again was beeing hidden by the unnecessary dirtying.",8,"0"

"CORE-514110","nanojit: avoid getresv() because it has a redundant test","Created attachment 398068
patch

We see this pattern a lot in the Assembler:

    Reservation* resv = getresv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

getresv() is inlined so it becomes this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

In optimised builds the assert is removed:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

The r->used test should always succeed (if it doesn't there's a bug which
a debug build should catch).

This patch removes all occurrences of this idiom in Assembler.cpp and
Nativei386.cpp (but not the other back-ends) replacing them with this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv->used)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

thus avoiding the unnecessary test.  (A couple of the modified places didn't have the assertion but the code relied on resv->used being true.)

Furthermore I introduced resvUsed() which does the assert itself so now 
you actually see this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resvUsed(ins)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

I also changed other resv = getresv(ins)... if (resv) occurrences to 
resv = ins->resv()... if (resv->used) for consistency and readability.

I've run SS several times and am seeing a 0--3ms speedup.  I also checked 
the generated asm and it's several instructions fewer for each occurrence 
and so is a clear win in terms of code size.",15,"0"

Updating the attribute font-size of an SVG text element from within a zoom event handler can cause the image to disappear.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the attached test.html and test.svg in a directory.
2. Open test.html in Firefox
3. Click zoom out. 
Actual Results:  
The image disappears.

Expected Results:  
The image should be zoomed out.

In the test case the SVG is incorporated via  and the embed is dynamically re-sized to fit the zoomed image (by updating its height and width attributes to match SVGRoot.currentScale). In this scenario the image consistently disappears and never reappears until the document is reloaded.

However commenting out the dynamic resize of the embed creates another scenario where the image disappears on the first zoom out then reappears on the next zoom out then disappears again on the next zoom out and so on. There are comments in the HTML source about what to comment out.

Bizzarely adding a  just before the embed affects the behaviour of this latter scenario: the image then does not disappear.

Removing the line that re-sizes the text makes everything work.

Test case works fine in FF2.",68,"1"

Gmail More Actions drop down menu appears momentarily under left-most button when first viewing message listings. It appears this happens when first clicking on More Actions button for any item on left-hand side (Inbox Starred Sent Mail etc.).

Subsequent tries do not yield this bug. You must go to another item on the left hand side like Starred Sent Mail etc. including any user-defined labels. Each time you go to one of these and then click on the ‚ÄúMore Actions‚Äù button the drop down will first appear under the left-most button before shifting to where it should be.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.3b) Gecko/20021227

With bug 173825 a message folder size column was introduced to the folder pane.
Depending on the size of each folder it shows kb or MB. In that other bug
there is no obvious reason why a lowercase b is used for the unit Bytes. So
I think this was an accidental slip and it should be changed to KB.

Four reasons why I think this should be changed:
- It looks odd (see screenshot I'll attach)
- It is the same unit so why use different case?
- b is often used for bits not bytes but from the source I see here it
means bytes
- From lxr I see Mozilla always uses KB for kilobytes (e.g. in the message
pane where the user sees it simultaneously which is even more confusing...) so
it should be used here also for consistency.

(The uppercase K (used everywhere else) should be ok here because it stands
for a factor 1024 (as usual): there is a distinction (that at least some make)
between K for 1024 and (defined by the metric system) k for 1000.)

Although this bug is visible at the front end I chose the back end component
because the affected code seems to be pretty far inside mail. Feel free to
change if I'm wrong...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mail window with some big (> 1 MB) and some small (< 1 MB) message
folders visible
2. Make sure the Size column is shown in the folder pane (the left one)


Actual Results:  
Folder size is shown in kb and MB.

just to the left of that i a dropdown list that specifies which events to show

i would like to add an option that states:
All events visible in calendar.

why would this be good?
if you use the multiweek view and have one or two passed weeks in your view
there is no good way to have the events pane to show the events from those
weeks. choosing All Events is to much but choosing any other view does not
help much if you need the last few weeks events for reference.

We would like to have an extension to support rendering of Scripts

of ctl extension (in mozilla/extensions/ctl) by any unix implementation
that would like CTL thai support. 

Please see bug #84380 for more details.

Am attaching the configure Makefile diffs to build this extension in a
non-default manner.

the patch minimizes/eliminates any risk whatsoever of thai ctl rendering 
code affecting any non-unix non-intended platforms.

It is expected to be enabled using configure option :
--with-extensions=defaultctl.

In addition the hook that uses this piece of code will be enabled only 
under --enable-ctl.

This means that a *nix build that needs to generate thai presentation 
forms before rendering needs to :

use : configure --with-extensions=defaultctl --enable-ctl 

Unix builds that do not use the above mentioned flags are not expected to
be affected in any way.

Please review the diffs and let me know if you have any issues.

"CORE-76198","Threadpool optimistically kills worker threads","SUMMARY

The threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number 
of threads is greater than the minimun limit.  

The file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads.  During startup 
there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity.  For every file that 
is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool.  The file 
transport sets min and max number for the number of threads.  The current logic 
in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the 
limit. When the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any 
pending requests.  If there are none and there are more threads in the 
threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits.  

Because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool.  The file 
transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant 
threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are 
primarly needed for startup.

Another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any 
additional request that may come in.  

For example:

From a normal startup to ftp://ftp.netscape.com.org there are 73 new threads 
created and 72 threads deleted.  (This is completely insane) After putting a 5 
second wait there are only 13 new threads created and 12 deleted.  This removes 
60 thread creation/deletions.  

Going to http://www.mozilla.org creates 49 threads.  Adding a 5 second delay 
reduces this to creating only 6 threads.

Clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so 
that we don't get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start.

I am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time.  I ran some basic 
timing tests.  On a P3 dual 500 (windows 2k 128mb ram) it take only 2ms to 
create 10 threads. However this is not a accurate picture since creation of a 
thread doesn't really do much but schedules it.  I also looked at how long it 
takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running.  The data indicates 
that it takes longer as there are more threads.  With 3 threads present it 
takes on average 200 milliseconds from the time PR_CreateThread() is called to 
the time the user defined function is entered and does a printf().  Maybe 
somebody here has better knowledge of thread startup preformance.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.6) Gecko/20040413 Debian/1.6-5

This bug exists in mozilla-1.6 and probably all later at least 1.7.

--- Scenario ---
Before body.onload a script can use document.writeln() to insert stuff. The
interesting part is what happens if it inserts another script fx:



// document.writeln() generates the inserted script
document.writeln(alert('executing inserted script'))
alert('done inserting')


Eventually the user will see both dialogs. The interesting part is that it might
happen in any order (this is not the bug):
1) Deferred execution: In some cases the inserted script is deferred. The
inserting script executes to completion then the inserted script is executed.
2) Immediate execution: In other cases the inserted script is executed
*immediately*. The inserting script is really interrupted and a new thread is
started executing the inserted script.

In Mozilla's case it has the rule has traditionally been:
- If the inserted script is inline (as above) it is executed immediately.
- If the inserted script is external () it is
executed deferred.

I have tested the behaviour in all browsers since I rely on it and they all
behave differently.


--- The bug ---
The important property that I rely on is:
- When inserted script is executed immediately
- and it fails with a script error
- the inserting script will continue from where it was interrupted as if the
inserted script had exited normally.

It has always been that way in all browsers. Now except mozilla-1.6 and 1.7
(tested under Debian Linux and Windows XP SP1).

In mozilla-1.6+ when an inserted script is executed immediately and it fails
it also takes down the main thread the inserting script. The inserting script
is simply never re-entered.

It seems that the error handler is to greedy when cleaning up. It takes down the
stack of the inserted script which it should but apparently it also takes down
the stack of the inserting script which it should not.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd>

Teardown on script error is too greedy



var s = +no_such_function()+
document.writeln(s)
alert(main thread continuing)



Actual Results:  
JavaScript Console reports that no_such_function does not exist correct. Then
nothing happens.

Note that if you instead insert a  (an external
script that contains a script error) the dialog is shown.


Expected Results:  
After the inserted script has failed the main thread should continue showing
the alert().

Mozilla-1.5 and earlier does the expected as does every other browser I
currently test on: Netscape-4.8/Linux Opera-7.51/Linux Konqueror-3.2.2/Linux
Internet Explorer 4 5 5.5 and 6 on various Windows platforms.


There was a bug before 1.6: If an inserted script was executed immediately and
it had a script error it would not be reported to the JavaScript Console. This
is fixed in 1.6. I suspect the fix may have introduced the new brokenness.",72,"1"

Neil yes the code now limits the depth into the directories into which

So here's the bug and a proposed patch. I chose J as the letter for object signing because both O and S are already used and J occurs in both obJect as well as in Jar - where such a cert also tends to be used...

In addition I added a diagnostic message when an incorrect option is supplied - with the current version certutil -V will just fail silently (it won't produce any output).

Finally I'm not sure if any other cert usage (besides ObjectSigner) should be added too... for the sake of completeness these are the remaining ones:

    certUsageSSLServerWithStepUp = 2
    certUsageSSLCA = 3
    certUsageUserCertImport = 7
    certUsageVerifyCA = 8

Looks like a bug to me.  Tested with CVS 1.11 all actions
performed on the trunk:

Does what you'd expect -- checks in a dead revision and moves
the v file to the attic.

Note that a cvs commit here correctly reports Up-to-date check
failed for `foo'.

	RCS file: /home/erics/t2/Repos/p/Attic/foov
	retrieving revision 1.1
	retrieving revision 1.2

	foo already contains the differences between 1.1 and 1.2

Shouldn't it have reported a conflict?

Commits User 2's text as a new undead revision (ie. state=Exp)
but DOES NOT move the v file back out of the Attic thus
violating this constraint as documented in the manual node
Attic:
	[...] the rule is that the RCS file is stored in the
	attic if and only if the head revision on the trunk has
	state `dead'.

The reported inconsistency between cvs checkout and
cvs checkout -D now follows from this.

When dynamically setting the clip regions of a HTML element the element sometimes isn't shown completely. The change of the clipping regions is done by an interval to have some simple animation effect.

The problem seems to depend on garbage collection this way:
I create complex html:body content dynamically using javascript holding a lot of references to JavaScript objects and back to the DOM elements. I remove all those elements and create others again. Removing and recreating is one step. The clipping animation immidiately starts after such a step. The animation often
hang and is sometimes not rendered completely although the css properties are set correctly. Moving other windows over the incompletely rendered object shows that it's there but not fully redrawn.

My guess is that GC runs after the page recreation step pausing further execution and also timers or at least redrawing. If GC starts before the animation is finished and stops after the animation step in between is not rendered.

Most text editors will save a file by either:

- writing out a new copy then renaming it over top of the old one or
- renaming the old file to a backup name then writing out a new copy

In either case the name now addresses a new inode and this seems to make mozilla sad on OS X.  If I reload it claims that the file is not found.  If I go to the URL bar and press enter it finds it back again.

If I go Back then Forward then Reload it works properly.  This would seem to suggest that something is being cached that gets used during Reload but discarded during Back/Forward or using the URL bar.

It doesn't always happen -- for example if I try it on the first local page I visit it doesn't seem to reproduce.  But if I click a link to another local page replacing that second page will reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two local html files say one.html with an href to two.html
2. Load one.html
3. Click the link to two.html
4. Rename a file over top of two.html or save it in vi

Issues currently being worked on:

- pgsql connection timeout

2) priority jobs are not being processed correctly as a result of main monitor thread dying

Solutions being worked on:
1) separating monitor threads
2) debugging python pgsql and NFS to figure out why the monitor is crashing

Why this is taking so long:
- each new monitor loop takes a matter of hours to populate the database
- the problem is not reproducable on identical hardware with an identical codebase

Current strategy:
1) using a collector update to create simple uuid entries in a top-level directory in order to avoid having to do deep scans for new jobs
2) having the separate main monitor thread be responsible for processing just these new uuid entries and nothing else
3) remove need for priority job processing and queueing from having to do any scans

"MAILNEWS_CORE-472005","Bayes trait analysis sees keyword header which biases the evaluation","The bayesian filter tokenizer currently sees headers that are set by mailnews itself such as the keywords header. This causes some strange feedback effects particularly in the case of applying soft tags. Since the existance of the keyword itself is obviously a very strong indicator for soft tagging with that header then whether the header is present or not has a strong effect on the calculated trait match percent. This causes after-the-fact trait bayesian percentage calculations to differ dramatically in some cases from the cases where the filter is applied during normal message reciept which is very confusing.

It is actually worse than that. The most common time when you train with a keyword applied is when you are correcting a false positive. In that case the presence of the keyword in the message is an anti-indicator of the need for the keyword. This causes an oscillation in values as the keyword is removed if present or placed if absent on subsequent after-the-fact calculations.

I need to decide whether to hard-wire the tokenizer to ignore headers set by mailnews itself or implement some sort of interface to allow extensions to manipulate the tokenizer.",32,"1"

Problem first found when developing a Microsoft Access database.
There is a facility to email a list of people from the database. A process reads
every record puts all the email addresses into a variable (varEmail) and sends
the variable to the Email program with this VBA code:

DoCmd.SendObject acSendNoObject   varEmail

The default Email program will open and place all the addresses into the To
line. The user may then complete the email message and send.

This procedure should work with any MAPI compliant email program. It works well
with Outlook Outlook Express and Eudora.

However with Thunderbird Access returns and error message that there were Too
many message recipients. There are in fact about 150 addresses. I can cut and
paste the entire list into Thunderbird's address line it just will not accept
that many addresses from Access. Note: I did not actually send the message - not
wanting to upset all those users. I refer to an already logged bug - 113251
which may yet cause problems with too many recipients.

The process works with Thunderbird if there are not too many recipients eg 50

Also noted by another user: when cut/paste more than 200 addresses Thunderbird
responds with the following message:
The size of the message you are trying to send exceeds a temporary size limit
of the server. The message was not sent try to reduce the message size and try
again. The server responded: Too many recipients.

1.Issue the VBA code from the Access database

With Firefox running but minimized click on a URL in another application (e.g.
Apple Mail).  The active tab in Firefox will display the correct URL but all
text boxes ignore entry.  This includes the search tool's text field and text
boxes on the URL.  Firefox must be minimized to observe this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.  Minimize the window.
2. Open Apple Mail.  Find an email with a link.  Click on the link.
3. Bring Firefox back to normal then try to type in a textbox.

Actual Results:  
The textbox cannot be made active.  It doesn't matter whether the box is on the
webpage or on the toolbar (search tool for example).  Because it is not active
I can't type text in the textbox.  If more than one browser window is open and
minimized only the active (last accessed) window is affected.  All tabs in
the window are affected.

Expected Results:

I have noticed that the navigation history is not working properly for websites using Ajax tech such as Google's Gmail.

1) Open Firefox homepage: www.google.com
2) Click Gmail
3) search l:unread in Gmail

There are two problems :
1. The failure should not be ignored . Not having softokn3.chk generated means
that NSS applications such as Mozilla will not be able to enable FIPS mode a
feature wanted by the government. The fix for this is to remove the - from the
rule which causes the error to be ignored .
2. The signing script sign.cmd did not execute . It appears that because I'm
running under the 4OS2 shell the result is 'Unknown command d:' on my system
. This is the first time I run into any build problem related to 4OS2. I have a
fix which works regardless of the shell the user is in which is to invoke the
default OS/2 command interpreter cmd.exe directly to run the script.

If you paste a multiline string inside chatzilla the string will end up being displayed over some lines (\n is beeing converted to a real new line). This also ends up geting into the logfile (if you use it).

As I am a developer of PISG (http://pisg.sf.net) an analys tool for irc logs I think this format is somewhat broken as all other clients I have looked at does create multiplie timestamps (one for each row) whereas chatzilla just creates one for the first line.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just paste a multiline string for example this is line 1\nthis is line 2\nthis is line 3

Actual Results:  
something like:

[HH:mm]  this is line 1
this is line 2
this is line 3

Expected Results:  
something like:
