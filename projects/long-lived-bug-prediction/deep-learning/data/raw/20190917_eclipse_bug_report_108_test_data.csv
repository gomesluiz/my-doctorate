	Decorator seems to work properly if I exit Eclipse and restart

MichaelV (10/10/2001 12:10:18 PM)
	Could this be as simple as the change event not being fired for the project?

MichaelV (10/10/2001 1:15:19 PM)
	It could also be caused by Merging. This may explain why it goes away over a restart",161,"1"

properties and the error messages is too brittle for these tests which must 
run with different JRE's on different platforms.

I propose a change to the tests to test the error key (which wasn't previously 
available). Although testing the error key still means there is a reliance on 
Xerces not to change error keys error keys are meant to be more stable than 
error messages so this approach should prevent most future test failures. This 
change also removes the file system requirement as files will no longer store 
the resulting error messages.",0,"0"

"EQUINOX-159506","[ds] DS has no error logging","Build id: I20060926-0935

I have been playing around with using org.eclipse.equinox.ds within the org.eclipse.core.jobs bundle but was having great difficulty because it always seemed to fail silently.  I finally found that it is discarding all exceptions and warning messages because there is no LogService registered. This is in the class org.eclipse.equinox.ds.Log.  It seems that either:

1) The equinox.ds component should have a backup plan when the log service is not available such as writing to std err. Or

2) The framework should register an implementation of LogService that forwards to FrameworkLog.

Otherwise there will be no error reporting when org.eclipse.equinox.ds is used in conjunction with the org.eclipse.osgi runtime.",429,"1"

"CDT-231381","[LR parser] performance issues with LPG backtracking parser","The LR based C99 and C++ parsers now pass against all the DOM parser tests except gcc extension tests (booya!). 

Jason has put a lot of work into developing a custom extension to LPG called the trial/undo parser driver. At one point we believed that we needed this extension to successfully parse C++ however the design of the LR parsers has changed and this extension is no longer strictly needed. Still there are good reasons to keep it such as: 1) Jason was able to address some performance issues and 2) its a very powerful feature that we may find use for in the future.

There are issues with the trial/undo driver though such as: 1) I have found at least one bug that causes some parses to fail and 2) we are maintaining a derivative of LPG.

Right now I am using the regular backtracking parser driver that comes with LPG. However this parser driver has a bug that leads to bad performance (discussed in bug 191121). 

We need to discuss if we should use the trial/undo driver and address its bugs or use the backtracking driver and address its performance issues.",17,"0"

Missing icon in notification popup

I am just testing the latest head (1.100.0.v20151210-0541) from [1] (update install into a fresh Mars.1 Eclipse for Java Developers) and noticed that the Eclipse.org endpoint misses an icon in the notification popup (see screenshot).

"JETTY-470664","Registering multiple RequestLogHandler results in only one called","Jetty server 9.3.0 embedded. I create two RequestLogHandler objects add them to a HandlerCollection() and wire them into the server.

Expected behavior: Both handlers have their log(Request Response) method called on each request.

Actual behavior: Only the second handler has its log(Request Response) method called. The first handler is never invoked.

Worked with Jetty 9.2.0.

Excerpt of handler construction. The log method of logHandler is never called:

        HandlerCollection handlers = new HandlerCollection()

        for (HttpResourceBinding resource : resources) {
            handlers.addHandler(new ClassPathResourceHandler(resource.getBaseUri() resource.getClassPathResourceBase() resource.getWelcomeFiles()))
        }

        handlers.addHandler(createServletContext(theServlet parameters false filters queryStringFilter loginService http https))
        RequestLogHandler logHandler = createLogHandler(config)
        if (logHandler != null) {
            handlers.addHandler(logHandler)
        }

        RequestLogHandler statsRecorder = new RequestLogHandler()
        statsRecorder.setRequestLog(new StatsRecordingHandler(stats detailedRequestStats))
        handlers.addHandler(statsRecorder)

        // add handlers to Jetty
        StatisticsHandler statsHandler = new StatisticsHandler()
        statsHandler.setHandler(handlers)

        HandlerList rootHandlers = new HandlerList()
        if (theAdminServlet != null && config.isAdminEnabled()) {
            rootHandlers.addHandler(createServletContext(theAdminServlet adminParameters true adminFilters queryStringFilter loginService admin))

3) I have set up the compiler options such that I get an error against Bar.foo
because it hides the Bla.foo
4) I use the rollover on the quickfix for the problem
5) Eclipse hangs in this state:

The processing instruction target matching [xX][mM][lL] is not allowed.
Is whitespace at the beginning of the file a valid error?  If so it's a pretty bad message.  Maybe nothing we can do about it...

What I really think should be cleaned up are the error stack traces curently being printed to the log file.

The main one that seems to printed everytime there's any validation problem is:

"SPHINX-358131","[M2x IDE Integration] Make Xtend/Xpand/CheckJobs more robust against template file encoding mismatches","= Problem description =
Currently Xtend/Xpand/CheckJob don't make any assumptions about the encoding of the Xtend/Xpand/Check files they have to process. They just create and let the respective execution contexts use an instance of org.eclipse.xtend.expression.ResourceManagerDefaultImpl which in turn attempts to detect the encoding of Xtend/Xpand/Check files using org.eclipse.internal.xtend.util.internal.icu.CharsetDetector.CharsetDetector() and other things. The problem is that this doesn't work out well for Eclipse workspace files all the time. It occasionally causes Xtend/Xpand/Check files to be loaded with inappropriate encoding information and exceptions like this

video for item 1

Build ID: 3.4.0

Steps To Reproduce:
1) 

When I try to install/update different plugins I sometimes got errors which don't have almost any meaningful information. Error says that plugin is missing but I couln't find it in available plugins list because plugin id is given in error and plugins are listed by name in plugins list. Sometimes I manage to find it but not always.

Please check attached video1. 

2)

Managing software sites is a nightmare. How can I choose sites from URLS (especially Eclipse URLs which are almost the same)? See attached images. Maybe you can remove http:// stuff. Or use hierarchical packages like in JDT? So it will look like:

[-] http://
  [-] eclipse.org
    [+] modeling
    [+] technology
  [+] perforce.com
[+] ftp://
[+] file://

etc.


3)

I added Subversion update site for version 1.4 and site for 1.2 appeared later (image2.PNG). Why? This wasn't an issue in Eclipse 3.3.

4)

When I select sites in Available Software Sites and click ok and then go back to Available Software Sites editor I might have sites selected which are different from ones I selected in the 1st place.

More information:

It looks like EquinoxLaunchConfiguration doesn't take into account bundle versions when generating program arguments.  The getBundles(boolean) method iterates over 'fAllBundles' obtaining an IPluginModelBase for each plugin.  It then uses only the ID when calling LaunchConfigurationHelper.getBundleURL to generate the bundle URL losing the version information.

In the end the failure was as below. Given that the branding bundle org.eclipse.jdt for this build should have ended with 1400 I think that means the feature org.eclipse.jdt got swapped out as unchanged from previous build ... but ... believe it should have incremented due to change in pde.build. 

Immediate fix I believe is to touch the jdt feature to make sure it increments. 

The root problem may have been the exact timing of the pde.build commit ... not sure ... but since it was committed shortly after the 11:00 build it may not have appeared to be the latest change?

In the RequestException there's a RequestError with a list containing one FieldError. The field error lacks a message field and hence contains only:

If I double click an editable column to activate the edit mode and press TAB the cursor goes to the next column as expected.

"PLATFORM-31159","[resources] PathVariableManager not thread safe","Build id: 200302060800

Attached is a zip file of a plugin I have created.  It is a modified hello world
example plugin.  Load it into eclipse and click the button.  It exposes a bug in
the way PathVariableManager handles setValue calls.

The following is the run method from the action in the plugin.  The basic idea
is to have two threads modifying the same path variable.  They both add and then
immeadiately remove the variable.  If the PathVariableManager was thread safe
you would never get two add or two remove notifications in a row.  The listener
recognizes when two add or remove notifications occur and prints to the console.

	public void run(IAction action) {
		IWorkspace workspace= ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace()
		final IPathVariableManager manager
		if (workspace != null) {
			manager= workspace.getPathVariableManager()
			if (manager == null) {
				System.out.println(null manager)
				return
			}
		} else {
			System.out.println(null workspace)
			return
		}

		IPathVariableChangeListener listener= new IPathVariableChangeListener() {
			int lastState
			public void pathVariableChanged(IPathVariableChangeEvent event) {
				int type= event.getType()
				if (type == lastState && type != IPathVariableChangeEvent.VARIABLE_CHANGED) {
					if (type == IPathVariableChangeEvent.VARIABLE_CREATED) {
						System.out.println(Created twice in a row)
					} else {
						System.out.println(Deleted twice in a row)
					}
				}
				lastState= type
			}
		}
		Runnable r= new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				String property=foo
				IPath value= new Path(c:\\)
				long time= System.currentTimeMillis()
				while(System.currentTimeMillis() - time < 5000) {
					try {
						manager.setValue(property value)
						manager.setValue(property null)
					} catch (CoreException e) {
						e.printStackTrace()
					}
				}
				System.out.println(end runnable  + this)

"ORION-393984","Orion project layout an being able to make my own Orion drop","This bug is to discuss changes in the project folders layout and also what I call ability to make my own Orion drop.
And I think those two items are related.

First some cases:
1) I create my Orion-based app which consumes just a small set of Orion libs and UIs. I would like to have an easy way to pull what I need create my own drop and then keep it in sync with the latest Orion.
2) I would like to consume just the Orion editor. 
3) I would like to deploy Orion client code on Tomcat or run as node.js no OSGi see the node.js work from Mark

I would like to make work on this cases easier.

What I think would help is:
1) Orion projects should not be Eclipse plug-ins
2) To run such Orion code on Equinox we would need a special Eclipse plug-in that handles Jetty mappings
3) To run in other evns (Tomcat node.js) we would just need to create mappings (right now you need to ripped off the code from Eclipse plug-ins first)
4) At first I thought we should put all the client code into one repo but now I think we should make a repo per each micro-service we have (registry plugins commands etc. maybe the editor) and put the rest into one repo. I would also try to decouple auth and make it a separate framework.

These are just some initial thoughts. Any other thoughts?",699,"1"

Our git configuration (.git/config) has the branch.rebase and branch.master.rebase option set to preserve. The full stacktracke (see below) looks like you try to parse the value as bool which of course is not the case. The preserve option is a standard Git option on workking on CLI and it is also working in EGit/JGit.

Example model with a repeatable test case

If you import an RSARTE model which consists of fragments (.efx-files) and then open the resulting Papyrus .uml-model via a structure/container model which performs an element import (the standard construct in RSARTE) or package import then the repair stereotypes dialog comes repeatedly up proposing to migrate the profiles in the fragment/submodel (UML-RT and Documentation profiles) each time you open the model even if you perform the repair.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Import the RSARTE models in the attached project 
2) Start by opening the resulting StereotypeRepairBug model and navigate into its separate submodel (originating from the .efx fragment in RSARTE). This works fine without any sterotype repair dialog popping up.
3) Now open one of the container models (ContainerModel used element import and ContainerModel2 uses.
4) Navigate into the element/package import triggering lazy loading of the imported model (and its submodel).
5) The Repair Stereotype dialog now pops up proposing to migrate the UMLRealTime profile and the Documentation profile both related to the submodel/fragment.
6) Perform the migration and save the model.
7) Close the container model and open it up again navigating into the element/package import again.

"JDT-373788","Compilation errors when you create new JUnit test case","Build Identifier: M20110909-1335

When you create new JUnit test case called Test you receive compilation errors.

There is following generate class:

import static org.junit.Assert.*

import org.junit.Test


public class Test {

	@Test
	public void test() {
		fail(Not yet implemented)
	}

}

The error message: 
Cannot convert Test to Annotation (in the line with @Test)

It should be @org.junit.Test annotation used instead of @Test

I just pushed a new tiny plugin project to JDT/Core's git:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/tree/org.eclipse.jdt.annotation

This is supposed to be shipped together with the patch for bug 186342.
That bug is currently in its end game and if nothing bad is detected
during the next few days we will want to include this like in Friday's
warm-up build towards M4.

Could you please coordinate with Satyam and Srikanth the necessary steps
to include this bundle in the build as part of the jdt feature?

Is it just adding entries to feature.xml and jdtcore.map?
How must the entry to the map file be initialized to participate in
automatic tagging?

"ECLIPSELINK-221530","JPA LRG fails in initialization","The JPA tests were failing because we were processing an aggregate as if it were a class.

The code that was the problem is in MetadataProcessor.processAnnotations()

Before this change it was processing Embeddable accessors as well.  Depending on the order of processing this could cause an Embeddable accessor to dealt with as a class and not as an Embeddable.  This could cause us to avoid some of the processing of Embeddables.

Small example models with changes in a moved object

If a new element X was added to a model and X has descendants of its own then the default engine creates ADDs for X and each of its descendants in the comparison result. The structure merge viewer in turn provides a CascadingDifferencesFilter which is enabled by default and will hide all of these ADDs except the one for X. This seems to be a reasonable decision because the descendants are added to the model as part of X.

However this filter also applies to ADDs in objects that have been moved. For example if an EAttribute x has been moved from EClass A to EClass B and an EAnnotation has been added to x then you will only see that x was moved but not the addition of the EAnnotation -- until you disable the filter for cascading differences. In my opinion changes in moved objects should not be treated as cascading differences and therefore not hidden by default because they are unrelated to the move.",5,"0"

"CDT-100602","When a variable is declared volatile its format cannot be changed","Use case:
Declare a variable “volatile” in you C program:
“volatile unsigned int i”
Set a breakpoint where that variable is visible. 
When the breakpoint is hit open the Variable View. 
See the variable appear there. 
Using the context menu on that variable “Format / Hexadecimal” try to switch 
to Hex format. Note that the switch didn’t work. It works if the variable is 
declared without “volatile”.

Kind of patch:
I have a fix for this use case in our product. Since I don’t completely 
understand the whole component here is the way I fixed it in our product.

In the beginning of the function: 
org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core.cdi.SourceManager.toCDIType

after the line:
String typename = name.trim()

I added the lines:
if( typename.startsWith(volatile )){
typename = typename.replaceFirst(volatile )
	typename = typename.trim()
}

It is more a suggestion than a patch. Keep it mind that it only fixes the test 
case described and I don’t know if the fix still stands if variables of other 
types are declared volatile.",12,"0"

"RTSC-454930","Global uninitialized constructed objects do not show up in ROV","Global uninitialized constructed objects do not show up in ROV because of a bug in the ELF parser used by ROV. 

For example:

Semaphore_Struct semStruct              /* does not show up in ROV */

Semaphore_Struct semStruct = {0}        /* this shows up in ROV */

This is because ELF parser logic for populating Symbol Table has a missing  condition. The symbol will be added to internal symbol table of the parser if:

            /* If this is a data or program symbol... */
            if ((entry.st_info == SymbolTableEntry.LINKER_SYMBOL) ||
                (entry.st_info == SymbolTableEntry.DATA_SYMBOL) ||
                (entry.st_info == SymbolTableEntry.PROGRAM_SYMBOL)) {
 
….
                /* Add the symbol to the map. */
                symsByName.put(entry.name val)
 
where
        private static final char LINKER_SYMBOL = 16
        private static final char DATA_SYMBOL = 17
        private static final char PROGRAM_SYMBOL = 18


The entry in the ELF Symbol Table for a global uninitialized object looks like:

                  
                     0x2088
                     0x9442
                     semStruct
                     0x20002d30
                     0x1c
                     STB_GLOBAL
                     STT_COMMON
                     STV_HIDDEN
                     0xe
                     .bss
                  

where
 
                 STB_GLOBAL = 1
                 STT_COMMON = 5
 
And st_info is calculated using :
 
                 #define ELF32_ST_INFO(bt) (((b)<<4)+((t)&0xf))

So from the above ELF symbol table entry the value of st_info is 21 which is not equal to LINKER_SYMBOL (16) / DATA_SYMBOL (17) / PROGRAM_SYMBOL (18) which we check for in the ELF parser.

The ELF parser has to be updated to handle STT_COMMON types.",2,"0"

Snippet

HEAD (cocoa)

StyledText makes CTabFolder send same KeyDown event multiple times.

- Run the attached snippet
- Press Alt+PageDown
=> CTabFolder switches to next tab (good)
- Now click into the StyledText Page 1
- Press Alt+PageDown
=> CTabFolder does not switch any more but you can see on the console that the KeyDown filter has been called 6 times instead of once.

As you can see in the stack trace below
	CTabFolder.setSelection(int) line: 3264	
calls
	StyledText(Control).setVisible(boolean) line: 3570	
 which ends up calling
	StyledText(Composite).nextValidKeyView(int int) line: 845	
 which sends out the same KeyDown again.


This is a problem for the Fix 2 from bug 199499. Steps to reproduce the bug there: Open a plugin.xml editor. Alt+PageDown lets you switch between subtabs of the multi page editor. But when you get to a source page the keystroke does not work any more.

"TARGET_MANAGEMENT-162883","[shell updating] No prompt on Solaris local shell","Open RSE perspective on Solaris-motif.
Select Local system Shells > New Shell.
The shell output is printed correctly but no prompt is shown.
I'm using a tcsh shell locally.

When I type ls several times it works OK after command completion a prompt is shown about 70% of the tries the other 30% I see no prompt.
When I export the shell contents to a file I do see the prompt.

This looks related to bug 142953 and might be a problem with shell event handling. I consider this a major issue since it is very disturbing for the user not to see a shell prompt.

Connecting to a remote Linux host with a tcsh through ssh shows the following:
* Initially not all output is printed and no prompt is shown
* After pressing ENTER once the rest of the output is printed prompt is shown
* When typing ls a prompt is always shown
It looks like shell update event handling is timing dependent and fails on the (very fast) local shell but works on the (slower) remote shell.

snippet

Calling a browser-function from within an execute method causes some kind of infinity-loop and crashes the browser. See attached snippet to reproduce.

Note: This doesn't work trouble-free in SWT/Win7 either but it doesn't crash. I think it might be a valid usecase when execute is used to call a javascript function that in turn (indirectly) calls the browser-function.

  Reason:
  IWAT0008E Either the agent controller (RAServer.exe) is not started or the
  Java path is incorrect. See log for more details.

The RAServer's sericelog.log says:

"EQUINOX-391319","bundleContext.getBundle(0).stop() does not shut down the system","I start the framework (for my own equinox based application) with the options

-Declipse.application.launchDefault=false -Declipse.allowAppRelaunch=true

The first option ensures that no IApplication is started automatically. This works the main thread is indeed waiting and I have to launch my first IApplication manually (in some OSGi service component).

The second option ensures that Quote:

    the main thread will continue to wait for another application descriptor to be launched after the currently running application has quit. Stopping the system.bundle (i.e. the bundle with a bundle ID equal to zero) will force the main thread to stop waiting for another application to launch.

This however does not work. The main thread keeps on waiting forever after the first IApplication stopped and I called

bundleContext.getBundle(0).stop()

in the same OSGi service component. The main thread waiting forever means that the JVM does not terminate because this thread keeps on running. According to the debugger it is the only thread that remains running.

The only proof I have is that once I set this option to false everything works i.e. the main thread stops after the first IApplication quit and the framework stops after calling

bundleContext.getBundle(0).stop()

Unfortunately this will prevent me from launching another IApplication after my first IApplication quit.

"PLATFORM-21281","[CVS UI] CVS Use causes stack dump","Using GM6 on Win2K Jdk 1.4.0 Running CVSNT 1.11.1.3 (Latest download)
Create repository in cvsnt. Add repository to Eclipse. Share project and point 
to existing. Eclipse commit all files to create first version in repository.
Continue to work in Eclipse as normal. 
Using another tool (WinCVS and jCVS both do it) look at a file in the 
pository and make a change. Eclipse will now complain with the message
Resource is out of sync with the file system: /VCF/CVS/Root if you right 
click any resource in the navigators from now on.  A stack trace is also put 
in the log file (below).

Solving it would be really good. I cant use Eclipse right now in a team 
situation until its fixed as we share code.  Thoughts or workrounds would be 
good.  Cheers  Paul

Some users now have the mis-impression that the JDBC SQL Select query supports output parameters because one can set its parameter direction to Output.

A good indicator of which parameter direction values to display at least for ODA data set types is by checking an oda.design.ui.dataSource extension's dataSetUI.supportsInParameters and supportsOutParameters attributes.  

In other words if

"BUILDSHIP-500647","Gradle Tasks view: Use title capitalization for tooltips","I'm currently testing the Eclipse IDE for Java Devleopers Neon.1 RC3 package with Buildshop 1.0.18.

It would be great if Buildshop could follow the Eclipse UI Guidelines [1] some more for example by using title capitalization for its tooltips (see screenshot).

Also it's customary to drop superfluous articles. Hence

  Link with Exlorer Views

rather than

  Link with the explorer views

in analogy to the Package Explorer's

  Link with Editor

(I'm sure there are other UI Guideline violations so feel free to open an umbrella bug for this. -)

"EQUINOX-444534","Locale parsing of -nl parameter allows invalid values","The parsing of the -nl parameter value in EquinoxConfiguration is currently only tokenizing the value by _. This allows users to enter invalid locale formats which later might cause issues in the Eclipse framework for the new locale change services. (see Bug 434846).

IMHO the parsing should be more strict to avoid setting of invalid locale values as default since EquinoxConfiguration is calling Locale.setDefault().",5,"0"
"EQUINOX-333726","[prefs] EclipsePreferences#flush synchronization problems","Hi

I am using 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate with Sun Java 1.6.0_20 JDK installed. I have installed the latest Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers for Windows 64 Bit platform it is Helios.
I have installed the latest JPA Diagram Editor from its dedicated Eclipse page: http://wiki.eclipse.org/JPA_Diagram_Editor_Project.


Scenario to reproduce:
0. Create some project with JPA 1.0 facet.
1. Open a clear fresh diagram and create some entities.
2. Delete all entities as Java sources remove them from the diagram as well remove them from the persistence.xml descriptor as well just leave the  
 tag there.
3. Open a clear fresh diagram and create a new Inherited Entity.
4. The entity java source is OK but according to it the entity does not inherit the created mapped superclass.

Hint: This behaviour e.g. deleting everything and starting from the beginning seems to cause quite strange things to happen.",272,"1"

The problem is that when the validation loops inside CompositeEValidator#validate() (called by Diagnostication#validate()) and encounters an uninitialized AbstractDeclarativeValidator with an @ComposedChecks annotation then it will eventually create an instance of the validator referenced by the annotation. This is done using Guice which then also injects the EValidatorRegistrar into the register() method. This in turn then adds the new validator to the CompositeEValidator using CompositeEValidator#addValidator(). This modifies the contents field and then causes the exception in the loop of CompositeEValidator#validate().",47,"0"

Patch

Build ID: I20080617-2000

When calling to open CDOEditor *by using WorkbenchPage.openEditor()* more than one time over the same resource the editor is opened several times instead of focusing on the already opened resource.

This is because WorkbenchPage.editorManager is not able to determine that the editor is already opened. EditorManager.findEditors performs several stages to determine if an editor is already open. One of the stages is comparing EditorInput.

Our problem is that CDOEditorInput.equals() is not working properly.
Once I implemented it the EditorManager did his work fine :D

I considered that two CDOEditorInputs are equal if:
- The resourcePath is the same
- The repository of the resource is the same

Making view.equals() as a constraint of CDOEditorInput.equals() wouldn't make sense since the same resource could be opened in diferent views.

However we can set as a constraint that the Repository UUID of the resource in the editor inputs are the same. This way we guarantee that the resource is the same under the same repository. 

I'm not sure if we should use Repository name instead.

So for my purpose I need at least CDOEditorInput.equals() and CDOSessionImpl.equals() overriden. I don't mind about CDOViewImpl but I think having it implemented won't be bad for the project maybe someone needs it in the future :P


I attach a patch for CDOEditorInput CDOViewImpl and CDOSessionImpl.


Oh and **maybe** this way we dont need CDOEditor.open() and CDOEditor.find() anymore (you can use now WorkbenchPage.findEditor(EditorInput) and IDE.openEditor() or WorkbenchPage.openEditor(IEditorInput input String editorId)).",1,"0"

When you create a data set that have data set parameters and then edit the dataset with something that have nothing to do with the parameters (eg: you edit a computed column) and press OK BIRT says that the first parameter have no default value and asks if you want to leave it that way.

When you say you don't want to leave it that way BIRT automaticaly changes to the parameter screen and you try to edit the parameter only to see that it HAVE the default value and nothing is wrong. You press OK and everything is fine.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new report

2. Create a JDBC datasource and a dataset with a query that need at leat one parameter.

3. Create the parameter and link it to a report parameter

4. Confirm the data set creation

5. Edit the data set

6. Create a new computed column. It can have anything just create a computed column with type Integer and value 1

7. Try to press OK you will receive a message There is input parameter [param_1] with empty value. Do you wish to leave it empty?

8. Press Cancel you will be sent to the parameter screen. In the parameter screen it will say that Input parameter param_1 should have a non-empty default value.

"SIRIUS-496985","Size problem after drag'n'drop of a regions container","Unlike classical container when a regions container is drag'n'dropped from
a container to another one it loses is size.
In Sirius 4.0 the behavior is different between Horizontal Stack and Vertical Stack. In Horizontal Stack the regions container is auto-sized after the drag'n'drop. In Vertical Stack the regions container is auto-sized only in one direction and the regions are auto-sized (the same bug concerning size of regions as in bug 495046).

After fix of bug 495046 and of bug 495119 the behavior is similar in Horizontal Stack and Vertical Stack: the regions container is auto-sized after the drag'n'drop.
This is probably due to the layout specificity of the regions container (always in {-1 -1} the dimension is handled by its region children).

Steps to reproduce:
* Open VStackDiag with DnD (of https://git.eclipse.org/r/76180)
* Drag'n'drop cccc from aaaa in diagram
* KO: The new cccc container is auto-sized.",7,"0"

"JETTY-432321","jetty-start / Allow defining extra start directories for common configurations","A new command line (tentatively) called --extra-start-dir= will be available.
It will add a single extra start directory (can be used multiple times) to the lookup / search paths.
If it finds a start.ini it will also underlay that start.ini into the live start ini.
A special property ${start.basedir} will be available within the context of each start.ini to report the base directory pointing to that start.ini (kinda like ${project.basedir} for maven) available for use (optional / not required).
Each --extra-start-dir location's start.ini can optionally define their own --extra-start-dir to continue the tree if they so desire.
${jetty.home} and ${jetty.base} stay the same and are always required.

The effective start.ini will be merged as follows ...

Starting with ${jetty.home} a blank start.ini is created (note: ${jetty.home} is special and any start.ini present in that directory is ignored)
Each --extra-start-dir is walked in logical order and their start.ini entries are overlaid to the current start.ini
Finally the ${jetty.base}/start.ini is overlaid.

Said another way the start.ini resolution order is:
  1) ${jetty.home} - blank
  2) [0..n] extra-start-dir/start.ini
  3) ${jetty.base}/start.ini

Some logic:
  * Duplicate --module entries are ignored
  * Any property following the pattern [A-Za-z]+.*=.* is broken into key = value and duplicate key entries are overridden
  * All other entries in start.ini are taken as-is and appended (last entry wins)

Currently the start.jar is tracking where each start configuration comes from we will try to expose this information in the --list-config output.
We will also strive to expose the behavior in the --debug output to provide troubleshooting of a configuration.

The effective search order for content follows the same lookup order as start.ini
So that a lookup for modules or libs will follow be:
  1) ${jetty.home} relative search
  2) [0...n] extra-start-dir relative search
  3) ${jetty.base} relative search
  4) absolute path lookup
  5) ${user.dir} relative file (same logic as new File(String))",332,"1"

More information:
The current implementation of the Changelog plugin uses CVS internal classes to perform diffs.  First of all this is wrong because it should not be using internal classes but secondly it narrows the scope of the plugin to only support CVS.

I propose a patch I have been working on which uses Team Repository methods to get the changes for the project and to use common methods for determining the file diffs.  The patch is attached.  It has been split out of some changelog plugin work I have been doing to solve both the issue with removed files not showing up and trying to not use CVS internal classes.  With the patch SVN works and removed file support is added.  In addition the changelog entry is better formatted with removed entries first then new then all changed items.  To split out the removed file support would have meant rewriting the PrepareChangeLog code so I left it in this patch.",49,"0"

waitForDone() never returns if onExceptiononConnectionFailed when RedirectListener is running.

I noticed that my exchange wasn't getting called if the next request after a 301/302 redirect fails with onConnectionFailed() or onException(). Looks like RedirectListener disables deligating and then doesn't specifically re-enable it in these cases: HttpEventListenerWrapper ends up dropping the onExceptiononConnectionFailed() on the floor.

Here is an extract from a test case which can reproduce this:

bs.accept do |sock|
  sock.write HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\n
  sock.write Location: http://localhost:54929/no-exist\r\n

  sock.write An incomplete chunk

waitForDone() never returns in this case.

-> Result: in the XtextDocument method setInput the statement
aResource = resourceSet.createResource(uri) (line 99)
returns the generic registered resource factory XmiResourceFactory instead of the XtextResourceFactory although the latter one was registered.

When a custom tag includes other JSP file using the 'include' directive hyperlink of the custom tag opens the included JSP file instead of the custom tag file.

This happens because the location string of the custom tag is overwritten in the following method during processing the included JSP file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a JSP file 'taglibs.jsp' in the webapp root directory.


2. Create a custom tag file 'myfunc.tag' with the following line and place it into the /WEB-INF/tags directory.


3. Create another JSP file with the following line.

Here's the .ecore file which contains a simple model with one EClass and three EAttribute:
* pottyok_int: EInt
* sugar_long: ELong
* sugar_longObject: ELongObject
 https://gist.github.com/2358325

If the attribute value is 1 only the labda_int pattern is working.

```
pattern labda_int(L)= {
 Labda.pottyok_int(L1)
}

pattern labda_long(L)= {
 Labda.sugar_long(L1)
}

pattern labda_longObject(L)= {
 Labda.sugar_longObject(L1)
}
```

root cause:
   
    new Integer(1).equals(new Long(1)) == false

which is bad because the constant literal is parsed as an Integer.

Possible solutions:

Solution 1: 
  long literals (1L) + type checker warning
  
Solution 2:
 replacing Object.equals() comparisons with a more permissive custom implementation throughout Rete
 
Solution 3. The Lazy Way
Equating an integer literal with a long value should be flagged by the type checker once it is ready.
One can then work around it through XBase by
    Labda.sugar_long(LS)    
    check(S == 1)
Eventually as expression evaluation will be supported this could be replaced with
    Labda.sugar_long(L eval(1L) )    
Which will make it much more efficient actually (indexed lookup vs. case-by-case expression evaluation).

Solution 4. I love surprises
All integers input into EMF-IncQuery (either as model contewnts or query parameters) should be promoted to long. This is tedious to do error-prone as it is easy to miss one case has a slight impact on performance has surprising side effects (e.g. query results will always be long)... I don't like this that much.

Solution 5.
Uzi: maybe it is possible to replace constants with XBase constants that are translated into Java either by the XBaseInterpreter or the XBaseCompiler. When I will have some time I will look into this direction.
 (Though the type checker is a prerequisite for this as well... I mean no one will bother to spell out 1L be it an Xbase literal or a custom one unless the type checker discovers that 1 is not going to work.)",1357,"1"

Abstract:
---------
JPA Diagram Editor is disfunctional in Mars. There is a workaround though: use it with previous Graphit version.

"CDT-219424","[Parser] bindings for names resolved via using declarations","Here in short what we have:
For names that are resolved via using declarations the parser creates special bindings (CPPDelegate). The mechanism to do that is complex because the binding is supposed to implement the same interfaces as the original binding that was introduced by the using declaration. One of the few differences is that the getScope() on the delegate returns the scope where the using-declaration is found. This is used for the purpose of navigating from the name to the using-declaration.

An example:
namespace ns {
   class cl {}
}
using ns::cl
cl c // reference to cl

The problem with it:
For clients dealing with the binding for the reference to cl it will be surprising to find that the the parent scope of the binding is the translation
unit rather than the namespace ns. Furthermore getQualifiedName() on the binding will return ::cl rather than ns::cl. For a correct handling the client would need to check if the binding implements ICPPDelegate but is not a namespace alias and then use ICPPDelegate.getBinding() to find the namespace that contains the class definition.

To demonstrate that even the parser-code itself is affected I created a testcase:
namespace ns {
    class cl {}
    void func(cl c) {}
}
using ns::cl
void test() {
    ns::cl qualified
    cl unqualified
    func(qualified)
    func(unqualified)
}

Here the first call to func() can be resolved whereas the second one cannot
because the parentscope of unqualified resolves to the global scope rather
than the namespace.


While the benefit of this construct is questionable (Navigating to the definition would match better to what we do in the other cases especially for
using directives we don't go to the directive either) it certainly adds complexity to the parser- and the client-code.

I propose to remove the CPPDelegate and use the original binding in its place. That'd clean up some of the code and fixes at the minimum the one bug I demonstrated above.

"Z_ARCHIVED-78224","GLA does not read new log records during live monitoring if file modification date does not change","GLA does not read new log records during live monitoring if the application 
writing to the log file does not close the file.  One such application is the 
Apache server writing to its access log file.  Currently the GLA uses the file 
modification time to determine whether the file has changed since it reached 
the end of file.  But if the application does not close the file the 
modification time will not change.  A fix for this problem is to check the file 
size as well as the modification time.  If one of them has changed then open 
the file again and continue reading the file from the last bookmark.

Here is the code fix in the BufferedPeriodicReader.prepare() method in the 
SingleOSFileSensor class:

currentFileStat=new File(filename)
if (currentFileStat.lastModified()>lastModified || currentFileStat.length() != 
lastSize) {
	currentFile = new RandomAccessFile(filename r)

Indeed in a Java 5.0-based client application autoboxing of primitive boolean values can be expected to produce distinct Booleans (at least it seems to in the IBM implementation).

"QVTO-377320","QvtOperationalResourceImpl.save() not implemented","Build Identifier: 20120216-1857

It seems to be a gap that QVTo can happily be used to create model instances for every diligently implemented ecore metamodel either in standard XMI Format or even textual when using a fine component like EMFText while QVTo Transformations can not be used to create a QVTo transformation file.

On evolving metamodels it might be helpful to have a transformation that produced a statistic transformation. Or it might help to generate detailed identity transformations or hello world-ish construction transformations to quick start transformation development on your new metamodel.

For textually represented metamodels is is easy to convert an example file into an acceleo or JET2 template while it is tedious to write the corresponding *.qvto-Fragment. Generating it thru a transformation would help QVTo to get comparable on that issue to M2T.

Last but not least the presentation from Nicolas Rouquette http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/dc-12/special-events/pdf/Rouquette-QVTo.pdf seems to highlight on slide 11 that this feature is needed to reach full OMG QVTO compliance on level SyntaxExportable.

1. Try the following Hello World transformation

    result.entry := object qvto::expressions::EntryOperation {

    }
}
=============================================
2. Or try following copy transformation on any qvto file
=============================================
modeltype qvto uses http://www.eclipse.org/QVT/1.0.0/Operational

transformation QVToCopy( in qvtoIn : qvto out qvtoOut : qvto)

main()
{
    qvtoIn.rootObjects()[qvto::expressions::Module]->map theMap()
}

mapping qvto::expressions::Module::theMap() : qvto::expressions::Module
{
    init
    {
        result := self

"GEF-298063","SWTException occurs in Figure.setForegroundColor when accessed from different threads","Build Identifier: 3.6.0.v20091126-1931

This is a regression caused by fix for bugzilla ID 289391 by ahunter.

SWTException: Invalid thread access occurs when org.eclipse.draw2d.Figure.setForegroundColor(Color) is called from a thread other than main thread.

This method was changed from:
public void setForegroundColor(Color fg) {
	if (fgColor != null && fgColor.equals(fg)) 
		return
	fgColor = fg
	repaint()
}

to: 

public void setForegroundColor(Color fg) {
	if (fgColor != null && fgColor.equals(fg)) 
		return
   	if (Display.getDefault().getHighContrast()) {
   		fgColor = Display.getDefault().getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_WIDGET_FOREGROUND)
	} else {
		fgColor = fg
	}		
	repaint()
}

here the check for Display.getDefault().getHighContrast() causes a SWTException: Invalid thread access.

In order to maintain original functionality I propose this method should be modified to something like this or as you feel appropriate:

	public void setForegroundColor(Color fg) {
		if (fgColor != null && fgColor.equals(fg))
			return
		boolean getHighContrast = false
		try {
			getHighContrast = Display.getDefault().getHighContrast()
		} catch (SWTException e) {
			// handle SWT Exception here
		}
		if (getHighContrast) {
			fgColor = Display.getDefault().getSystemColor(
					SWT.COLOR_WIDGET_FOREGROUND)
		} else {
			fgColor = fg
		}
		repaint()
	}

This is critical defect and has led to loss of functionality in our product.

When done the mirroring app reports this:

Mirroring completed with warnings and/or errors. Please check log file for more
information.
Log file location: D:\Download\devtools\Eclipse\3.5-I-new\ws\.metadata\.log

But looking at the log (attached) there are neither warnings nor errors. There are only Info severity messages that some items to be mirrored had already existed in the target repository. This bears two areas for improvement:

1. The final message should not mention errors / warnings if there have 
   only info severities been logged.
2. The info severities should not carry a stack backtrace which just blows

"CDT-509320","new API for PersistentPTY didn't cause increase in dependency on PersistentPTY (can cause ClassNotFoundException)","The new API was added in o.e.cdt.core.native version 5.10 but as there is no dependency on it that requires 5.10 (o.e.cdt.core requires 5.7) OSGi resolver can choose an older version without the new API. The dependent plug-in is o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb.

Normally within CDT we don't pay much attention to dependency versions between plug-ins but o.e.cdt.core.native is a special case because LaunchBar and PTP update sites both publish them (circular dependency here between PTp + CDT and also between LaunchBar and CDT). The circular dependency is not in itself a problem (although annoying) but it does mean that those plug-ins need better management of version numbers.

To make matters more complicated the dependency from o.e.c.dsf.gdb to o.e.c.core.native is via a re-exported dependency in o.e.cdt.core. Therefore really o.e.cdt.core should have its version increased and o.e.c.dsf.gdb should depend on that increased version. Alternatively o.e.c.dsf.gdb can just start depending directing on o.e.cdt.core.native.

I am about to push a gerrit with these version requirements resolved. It is too late to fix this in 9.2 but as we plan on a 9.2.1 I think we should fix it in that version. 

This can cause the user effect of seeing some class not found errors (ClassNotFoundException) or similar because the wrong bundle is resolved although in practice the OSGi resolver got the correct one for me). Also for devs because of various issues with PDE resolvers sometime picking up target platform bundles instead of workspace bundles (fixed in Oxygen m4 AFAIK) you can get The import org.eclipse.cdt.utils.pty.PersistentPTY cannot be resolved even though it is right there in your workspace.

PS This is probably part of the reason that cdt.target referenced its own nightly build to pick up o.e.cdt.core.native because the cdt.target pulls in PTP and LaunchBar which re-publish our own build outputs.

The build issue of course should be solved by splitting the build. One for another day perhaps.

I think there is two things we need to do:

1- I will file a security issue against the oauth2_client module.
2- On our servers we can update php.ini:

I suggest we add a request_order directive with the following value:
 This directive determines which super global data (GPCE & S) should
 be registered into the super global array REQUEST. If so it also determines
 the order in which that data is registered. The values for this directive are
 specified in the same manner as the variables_order directive EXCEPT one.
 Leaving this value empty will cause PHP to use the value set in the
 variables_order directive. It does not mean it will leave the super globals
 array REQUEST empty.

 Production Value: GP

stale index data.  Basically after a certain point the indexer just ignores
requests and the file never gets reindexed.  I had to shutdown & restart eclipse
(closing/opening project didn't help) to get back the normal behaviour. 

It's easier if you start with a clean workspace or make sure you close all open
projects in your workspace.  This is to avoid filling the type cache with extra
symbols we're not interested in.

1. Create a new project (I used standard make C Project).

2. Create a file test.c with simple contents eg:

struct aa {
   int x
}

Note: don't bother with any includes above since this will add extra symbols we
don't care about right now.

3. Open the C/C++ Browsing perspective.

4. Select your project in the Projects view and (global) in the Namespaces
view.  You should see aa in the Types view.

5. Double-click the aa to open the file in the editor.

6. Now change the aa to ab and save the file.  You should see ab show up
in the Types view.

7. Repeat #6 changing the name to ac ad ae etc. and always saving
immediately after.  Do this rapidly and keep incrementing the sequence.

8. Eventually the type name will be stuck and will not be in sync with your
last edit of the file.

You can see what symbols are being picked up from the index by setting a
breakpoint in the IndexerTypesJob.addType(..) method.  When the indexer stops
updating you will see stale data here.

You can see where the index requests are being queued by setting a breakpoint in

When inspecting the .uml-files it looks like the stereotype applications are still stored in the original .uml-file where the element were created and they have not been moved along into the submodel.

If you instead create the element directly in the submodel then the stereotype application is stored in the .uml-file for that submodel.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create a UML-RT model
2) Create a Capsule1 and a Protocol1 in the root of this model
3) Create a Package1
4) Store the Package1 into its own submodel
5) Now drag-and-drop the Capsule1 into Package1
6) Do the same with Protocol1
7) Now open the Package1 submodel on its own
8) Observer how the Capsule1 and Protocol1 have lost their stereotype applications. The customization of the Protocol1 is of course alos not made revealing all the detailed internal elements of the protocol.

I am using Indigo SR2 here with M2E.  Under each Maven module there is a directory called target which is created during the build process.  M2E appropriately marks this directory's derived attribute as true.

Nonetheless validation still occurs in that directory.  Specifically XML validation...which presents warnings about various surefire test reports.

"CBI-465591","Change code organization of maven plugins","See bug 465458 for the origin of this one.

eclipse-cbi-plugin has direct dependency to Tycho so it should always be built against the latest Tycho-SNAPSHOT version. A new release of this plugin should be built after a new Tycho release against this latest release. The declaration of the Tycho plugin repository in the parent pom is confusing because it is only there for one of the module. I propose to move it to the eclipse-cbi-plugin's pom.

win mac and jar-signer plugins don't depends on Tycho. So it should not make any difference when one of them is to be released.

Each maven plugin is signed with the jar signer. As David explained in bug 465505 we have a chicken and egg problem. I propose to get rid of the usage of jar signer from the maven build and add a shell step in the Hudson build that will call the jarsigning webservice with curl. 

Finally I propose to break apart all of these plugins. It should be possible to build / test / release each of these plugins (eclipse-cbi and *signer) individually. They should have their own version number too.

"WTP_SERVERTOOLS-129686","Incorrect binding of JRE to J2EE runtime when setting up a server","This issue is somewhat related to bug 127794 and I am submitting as prompted by Konstantin:

Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-99)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-56 mixed mode sharing)


Upon opening up a new workspace Eclipse finds the correct default system JVM and uses it.  I then go into preferences and set the default project java compiler compliance to 5.0.

At this point I can create a Dynamic Web Project (haven't tried with other WTP project types) and I do get the proper choice of using the 5.0 config for the java facet--this is with NO servers configured and therefore no binding to a particular J2EE runtime.

The problem that I am running into occurs when I try to do the same thing after having setup a J2EE runtime (Tomcat 5.5 JBoss 4.0 Geronimo 1.0 tested). Upon opening the Dynamic Web Project wizard and getting to the second page (facet page) and clicking Show Runtimes I can see that the J2EE runtime has a JRE configured as 1.4 even tho Eclipse is indeed using the 1.5 JVM.  This happens always as long as there is a server defined in the global preferences.  It happens even if you explicitly choose the non-default EMPTY runtime on the first page of the wizard--I believe this to be an artifact of runtime loading/caching when the page is first displayed as if there is a server defined it will be the default value.

With Konstantin's advice I debugged through a running instance of the workbench while creating a few Dynamic Web Projects.  While stepping through the code in org.eclipse.jst.server.core.internal.RuntimeBridge::getRuntimeComponents() there is this code:

			IJavaRuntime javaRuntime = (IJavaRuntime) runtime.loadAdapter(IJavaRuntime.class null)
			if (javaRuntime != null) {
				if (timestamp != ((Runtime) runtime).getTimestamp()) {
					vmInstall = null
					jvmver = null
					timestamp = ((Runtime) runtime).getTimestamp()
				}
				if (vmInstall == null)
					vmInstall = javaRuntime.getVMInstall() 
				if (jvmver == null) {
					IVMInstall2 vmInstall2 = (IVMInstall2) vmInstall
					if (vmInstall2 != null)
						jvmver = vmInstall2.getJavaVersion()
				}
				IRuntimeComponentVersion rcv
				
				if (jvmver == null)
					rcv = RuntimeManager.getRuntimeComponentType(standard.jre).getVersion(1.4)
				else if (jvmver.startsWith(1.3))
					rcv = RuntimeManager.getRuntimeComponentType(standard.jre).getVersion(1.3)
				else if (jvmver.startsWith(1.5) || jvmver.startsWith(5.0))
					rcv = RuntimeManager.getRuntimeComponentType(standard.jre).getVersion(5.0)
				else if (jvmver.startsWith(1.6) || jvmver.startsWith(6.0))
					rcv = RuntimeManager.getRuntimeComponentType(standard.jre).getVersion(5.0)
				else // default || jvmver.startsWith(1.4))
					rcv = RuntimeManager.getRuntimeComponentType(standard.jre).getVersion(1.4)
				


vmInstall and vmInstall2 are the same instance and jvmver is assigned as null in BOTH cases because vmInstall2.getJavaVersion() returns null (even though looking at the in memory instance it appears to know that it is a 1.5 jvm).  The code at this points defaults to 1.4 and leaves it at that.

The new viewpoint mechanism seem to break this rule. If a diagram project is missing or is in error it is not possible to create a Papyrus model anymore (NPE).
This let me think that the diagram declaration is not in the diagram project itself but somewhere else. This is for me a regression as it breaks the extensible capability of Papyrus.

"GMF-RUNTIME-276511","Infinite loop caused by rounding error in RelativeToBorderLocator","Looks like following code in RelativeToBorderLocator.relocate(IFigure target) works incorrectly for zoom values different from 1:

Rectangle bounds = reference instanceof HandleBounds ? ((HandleBounds) reference).getHandleBounds().getCopy() : reference.getBounds().getCopy()	

reference.translateToAbsolute(bounds)
target.translateToRelative(bounds)

as a result bounds rectanlge will be translated first to absolute coordinates and then to a relative coordinates. 

In case both figures (reference and target) are enclosed into the ScalableFreeformLayeredPane figure (default figure used for displaying diagrams) then called ScalableFreeformLayeredPane.translateToParent()/.translateFromParent() will introduce unwanted rounding error (see Rectangle.performScale() implementaton). My suggestion is: do not translate bounds to absolute coordinates and back here but rather translate bounds to common parent figure and then back. Since common parent figure is ScalableFreeformLayeredPane in this case coordinates will not be scaled so there will be no rounding errors.

Way to show up this problem:
1. generate diagram (ecore example diagram) with validationEnabled=true  validationDecorators=true liveValidationUIFeedback=true GenDiagram options switched on.
2. Create new instance of this diagram introduce any validation errors associated with diagram element (in case of ecore diagram - set the name of the package represented on diagram to null).
3. Validate diagram -> error validation decorator will be added to the diagram figure and attached to the top-right diagram element corner.
4. Ensure animated zoom is enabled in diagram options.
5. Zoom in diagram editor.

As a result diagram editor will enter infinite loop. The reason of this loop is:

reference.translateToAbsolute(bounds)
target.translateToRelative(bounds)

calls will always increate the width of bounds object by 1 (as a result of rounding error) then decorator will be repositioned into the properly calculated place as a result the size of diagram will be recalculated and increased by 1.

"GEF-109245","Palette View does not refresh right when switching between editors.","If you switch editors between two GEF editors with different palettes (or one
that doesn't have any) and the perspective you are in doesn't currently show the
palette the palette view does not update correctly when you switch back to a
perspective that does have it.

Simple repro case:

1. In a clean Resouce perspective open palette and save this perspective as
Resource 2.
2. Now open a logic example GEF editor and a flow example. When looking at
the logic mode. Switch between them. The logic example has palette items the
flow doesn't. 
3. Stay on the logic example and switch to the original Resource perspective.
4. Now when the palette view isn't shown switch back to the flow example.
5. Switch back to the Resource 2 perspective now the flow example has the
logic examples Palette!!

This is true in any direction. In general the palette needs to be refreshed
when being unhidden and it doesn't seem to be. There doesn't seem to be a simple
external workaround for this.",48,"0"

The riena ProgressProviderBridge is responsible for the creation of a special IProgressMonitor for scheduled jobs/uiprocesses. The bridge needs to be registered as ProgressProvider of the JobManager-singleton.
The riena application replaces the original ProgressProvider of eclipse (ProgressManager) with the ProgressProviderBridge in the JobManager.
With Indigo (M5) the ProgressProviderBridge of riena is replaced again after registration.",0,"0"
"DALI_JPA_TOOLS-340175","JPA facet no longer exposes jpaPlatform to library provider enablement condition","There were some changes made to the JPA facet for Indigo the upshot of which the jpaPlatform variable is no longer being made available during library provider enablement condition evaluation.

This breaks adopters such as OEPE that depend on this variable to filter out inappropriate library providers and there doesn't appear to be a suitable replacement. 

Using validation to block the use of inappropriate library provider would have a significant impact on usability as the user would be presented with a number of library providers (many of which are invalid for the config) and it is possible that the library provider with highest priority (the one that gets selected by default) ends up not validating.

Here is how OEPE defines JPA library providers:

- added about.html
- put standard Equinox preferences for formatting and warnings
- added icons forled into binary build

Steps To Reproduce:
In 4.0.2 I now get a new dialog (snapshot attached) asking me to either Enter memory space and address or Enter Expression.

What makes it worse is that you can't control the appearance of the functionality (even if completely irrelevant even dangerous for your target) and that this is now the default option for the dialog.

I have a report where I set a background color (light green) in the 
masterpage.
In PDF output the background color is ok shared all over the page.
But in HTML format there appears a white border (left side top side right 
side) and in the bottom a big white area.
(see attachment birt.jpg)

How can I achieve that the whole webbpage appears in light green (like in PDF output) without any whiteborder?

I tried also to use the predefined CSS style 'report' and the background-color attribute. But it seems to have no effect neither.

Furter investigations have shown me that te predefined CSS-style 'report' leads into a style_0 in the reports HTML source.
So I did furter tests:

If I change e.g. the 'font-familiy' format within the 'report' style then I see an immediate effect on the font-family format within style_0 of the source of the HTML page.
But if I change the 'background-color' format within the 'report' style and preview my report nothing happens.
If I look into the HTML source again I expect to see a 'background-color:' format within style_0 but it is'nt there!?!
Why it is not there?

So how can I get rid of this white border arround my chart?

1. I tried using the masterpage backgound color --> no effect
2. I tried to use the predefined 'report' style background-color --> does not appear in style_0 and so it has no effect on the page neither

So any ideas?",404,"1"

- create a .txt file
- open it in both perspectives
- modify and close it in one
- there is no prompt to save
- close it in the other

This seems reasonable on the surface but can actually be quite confusing.

The expectation is that if I close an editor with unsaved changes it prompts me.
People often use this as a shortcut for hitting save: they expect to get prompted.

This is especially confusing if the other perspective has its editors hidden.
If so you don't find out about the unsaved changes until you try and exit.

While document sharing should work across perspectives it should still prompt to save
when closing an editor with unsaved changes.

When you export via Archive File the timestamp of all the files in the archive is set to the current time regardless of the local timestamp on disk. Likewise importing back from the archive via Existing Projects into Workspace sets the timestamp of all files to the time of import.

There's nothing broken by this behaviour but it is annoying from a development perspective. If someone sends me a zip of their projects everything is new and there is no quick or easy way to tell what has been recently changed. If you use zip files as a way to exchange information you really need a binary comparison tool in addition to Eclipse.

Is there any reason for this behaviour? If not please preserve timestamps on export and preferably import too. If there is a reason to keep the current behaviour this could be provided as an optional setting in the wizard.",233,"1"

IWorkbenchPage#hideView(IViewPart) does not always dispose of the given view any
more. I'll describe our findings regarding the failing PackageExplorerTests from
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests (started to fail in N20050723-0010). This is a major
semantic shift that may well affect other clients.

Our calling sequence in these tests is this:

IWorkbenchPage page= fWorkbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage()
fMyPart= page.showView(...id...)
...
page.hideView(fMyPart)
fMyPart.dispose()

Previously IWorkbenchPage#hideView(..) has disposed of all SWT resources
associated with the view part. The next invication of
IWorkbenchPage#showView(..) then created a new instance of the view. This is no
longer the case now. #showView(..) now sometimes returns an old instance of the
view part. This is maybe connected to bug 104991.

If you don't consider this change a bug in Platform/UI please advise on how
else we can programmatically close a view such that it is properly disposed and

"AJDT-250375","%updateURL can not be used in feature.xml","Build ID: 3.4.1

Steps To Reproduce:
During startup from a clean install AJDT eclipse Error Log warns of Feature references invalid site: org.eclipse.ajdt.source java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: %updateURL.

This is because the %updateURL is being used in features.xml I believe that you can not use the % substitution mechanism for that data element of features.xml (I don't know why this is but if you compare is against other features).


features/org.eclipse.ajdt.source_1.6.0.200809031144/feature.properties does not contain updateURL but features/org.eclipse.ajdt.source_1.6.0.200809031144/feature.xml references it.


features/org.eclipse.ajdt_1.6.0.200809031144/feature.properties DOES contain updateURL and
features/org.eclipse.ajdt_1.6.0.200809031144/feature.xml
references it but an error about %updateURL usage is still given.


Action Point:

Please remove all thought and notion of %updateURL and quote the full URL into features.xml instead.  The 2 features AJDT SDK provides are affected.

ITraceInformation.getTraceToSource(IStorage)
assumes that there is an IStorage for a derivedResource which typically is a .java file.

However when dealing with JARed files there are only IStorage-instances for non-Java-resources.

The impact is that trace files can not be loaded for JARed .java files. 

Possible solution 1:
introduce IJdtTraceInformation.getTraceToSource(ITypeRoot)

A TypeRoot represents an IClassFile or ICompilationUnit.

Possible solution 2:
ITraceInformation.getTraceToSource(IProject project URI javaFile)
this avoids the necessity of having an IStorage for .java files.

Possible solution 3:
Provide our own IStorage implementation for .java files. The interface is not so complex. Our IStorage2URIMapper would be affected too.

"PLATFORM-513883","e4 Depency injection fails if not running in an OSGi context","Created attachment 267343
the stacktrace

I'm currently in the process of setting up some swtbot-based tests for a RCP application and thanks to e4 dependency injection and e4 parts it is very easy to set up test cases that run with the plain junit runner (instead of launching full-blown Junit-Plug-in-Tests). That's really cool!

Nevertheless I stumble across the following bug: In some of my parts I have instances in which I want to inject values from an eclipse context. The creation of these instances is *not* under my control. To inject values in these objects I use the following method:

    // 
    ContextInjectionFactory.inject(myDiAwareInstance context)

This call fails if the test is executed as a standard junit test: 

java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
	at org.eclipse.e4.core.internal.di.InjectorImpl.findExtendedSupplier(InjectorImpl.java:603)
	[...]
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.eclipse.e4.core.internal.di.osgi.ProviderHelper.(ProviderHelper.java:40)
	... 59 more

The ProviderHelper class contains the following code that causes the problem:

	static {
		// in case if any extended object supplier changes clear the supplier cache
		BundleContext bundleContext = FrameworkUtil.getBundle(ProviderHelper.class).getBundleContext()
		[...]
		try {
			bundleContext.addServiceListener(new ServiceListener() {
				[...]
			} filter)
		} catch (InvalidSyntaxException e) {
			// should not happen - we tested the line above
			CoreLogger.logError(Invalid filter format in the provider helper e) //$NON-NLS-1$
		}
	}    

If the code is executed without an OSGi context  FrameworkUtil.getBundle returns null.

The code is called in class 'org.eclipse.e4.core.internal.di.InjectorImpl (line:603)':

			ExtendedObjectSupplier supplier
			try {
				// use qualified name to refer to a class that might be missing
				supplier = org.eclipse.e4.core.internal.di.osgi.ProviderHelper.findProvider(key defaultSupplier)
			} catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
				return null // OSGi framework not present
			}

The code already handles the case that the OSGi framework is not present - unfortunately the caught exception is not the one that is thrown in my case.  Is there a specific reason that only the NoClassDefFoundError is caught?",365,"1"

"GEF-27601","[Logic Example] Direct edit interferes somehow with IME","tordadt CMVC defect 21113: TVT - ko - Garbage characters in the node name (sev 
2).

Problem was reported during Korean TVT testing and reproduced on a normal 
Win2000 box set to use a Korean input locale.  The IME composes complex 
characters from simple ones as you type--i.e. the user types a sequence of 
letters like vmf and each letter typed replaces the existing char with a 
newer more complex char.  The sequence vmffhdn is supposed to produce 3
characters.

The way the composition is accomplished is the IME sends selection messages
to the OS text widget to select the character you just typed.  Then when you
press the next key the new character replaces the old one.

This works fine in SWT Text widgets (e.g. properties dialog) and normal 
StringCellEditors (e.g. properties view).  However it doesn't work in direct
edit (both the flow editor and the .logic sample are broken).

In direct edit when the user types a char a region off the end of the string
is bogusly selected.  Instead of replacing the last typed char each new char 
is appended to the string.

There's a flicker that looks as if the IME is selecting the proper char and 
then this selection is being whacked--but I'm guessing about that.",160,"1"

"MYLYN-166540","Task repositories cannot be used through an auth proxy","I work behind an authenticated proxy at work and at home I can either go through the proxy through my VPN or go straight to the internet.

I find that Mylar and Eclipse have trouble when I try to define an external URL (like the repo URL) when I'm behind the proxy.  It just says UnknownHostException: bugs.eclipse.org.  I've defined all of my proxy settings correctly I believe.  I have no trouble 

Before version 0.9.1 of Mylar I was at least able to have my Bugzilla repo defined while off the proxy (from home) but afterwards it could still sync even while on the proxy.  It was only JIRA that still failed to sync while on the proxy.

Now on version 0.9.1 I can't do anything with task repositories while on the proxy.  The settings won't validate and syncs fail with the UHE.

One thing that seems curious to me is that with 0.9.1 there are optionally separate proxy settings for each task repository which seems odd as you're still coming from the same place no matter where the repo is.  The proxy settings for each repo shouldn't be different.  The other curious thing is that it refers to the Install/Update settings (in the Preferences I assume).  In those settings you can set the proxy host/port but not the user/pwd.  If I don't have the Install/Update checkbox set then I can set the user/pwd for each repo (which is again redundant as that shouldn't change for each repo).

If I enter those proxy values while on the proxy it won't let me store them as I get No Bugzilla server found at url.

Also note that when I plug that same URL into my web browser it has no trouble getting there.

It almost seems like the URL validation is not done through HTTPClient in a way that is not using the proxy.",5,"0"

"GMF-TOOLING-191488","Generated providers cause early bundle loading","While debugging Bug 190353  I discovered that the generated providers cause GMF bundles to be loaded. This means that when one GMF diagram editor opens all other providers cause other GMF bundles to be started.

This is a critical issue since opening a GMF diagram causes N other GMF bundles to be loaded.

This is likely a known problem and a duplicate of Bug 149328  but this is now critical as we have three diagrams in the SDK: ecore gmfgraph and gmfmap (and even more if you include the samples).

The first step is to add the providers package to the list of packages that do not cause the plugin to load using the Eclipse-LazyStart exceptions list.

The second step is to add a check to the provides() method to make sure the provider's bundle has been started and is ACTIVE.

So far the offending providers are:

XXXIconProvider
XXXModelingAssistantProvider
XXXParserProvider
XXXShortcutsDecoratorProvider

I am attaching a patch to the GMFGraph editor as an example.",558,"1"

"MPC-316362","MPC considers all repositories when installing","When installing software through the MPC the MPC consults all known p2 repositories.  To be specific when you select a component from the market place the MPC first computes the URL (update site) for this component but then the install operation loads this URL plus ALL OTHER p2 repositories to determine the dependencies.  

For example I have 10 repositories listed in my Available Software sites and when I install a component through the market place all 10 repositories are first fetched and loaded.

This approach has a number of problems:

1. Performance.  The fact all repositories are first loaded means that all repositories must be reachable (or we timeout trying).  For example at EclipseCon where we sometimes have a dedicated server if we hosted a marketplace on that dedicated server it would not matter because clients would still attempt to reach the outside world for each install.  This also means that as clients start using both p2 and the MPC to install things they will begin to face serious performance hits.

2. Authenticity of what I'm installing.  If I list a URL for my component at the market place then I assume that this URL will be the one consulted when the component is installed. However if the same component is listed in more than one p2 repository then it's anybodies guess which repository will actually provide the component.",2,"0"

"QVTO-309762","Extending a transformation does not work together with disjuncts","Build Identifier: Build id: 20100218-1602 (Galileo SR2)

When extending a QVTo transformation (using extends) and the original transformation being extended uses disjuncts that refer to some mapping functions they seem to be resolved in the original transformation instead of the extended transformation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you have ecorecopy.qvto ecorecopy_extended.qvto and test.ecore (attachments).
2. Run the ecorecopy_extended transformation on test.ecore:
3. Notice the output on the console:
  ecorecopy_extended::EPackage::transEPackage()
  ecorecopy::EClass::transEClass()
  ecorecopy::EClass::transEClass()
4. As expected the transEPackage is from ecorecopy_extended. However I also included the transEClass in the extended version and it should have overwritten the one from ecorecopy but it doesn't. My entire transformation is much larger but the core problems shows here. I suspect it has something to with the disjuncts used in EClassifier:transEClassifier. Maybe somehow it is resolved locally in ecorecopy instead of the extended ecorecopy_extended?",1021,"1"

all requests result in a variaton of 
    ERROR   java.net.UnknownHostException: XXXX@XXXX.tu-berlin.de
if there was no ':' part of the uri - or - in 
    ERROR   java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: XXXX@XXXX.tu-berlin.de
if a ':' (colon) was given in the uri.


For us this mechanism alway tries to seperate serverpart and portpart of an uri if an colon is seen otherwise the whole part after protocol (://) and before local files-structure (the next '/' char) is interpreted as the servername regardless of any '@' char.  

This behaviour contradicts the description given in the BuckyBook p.38 ff..






By the way the uri
format=https://XXXX.tu-berlin.de/nexus/content/groups/public
gives ERROR   Unauthorized which is quite a correct error message. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up own Maven Repo with Authentication e.g. Nexus(http/https) with user+password required or Apache2 with basic auth populate with components
2. Write RMap with contacts to the Repo credentials directly or evaluating properties inserted into uri: https://username:secret@protected.maven.repo.org/repository/

Y : simple runnable verticle that includes A and logs out the number inside SomeObject class on start

It has been a lot of discussion around incubating and beta components e.g. see Bug 518696.

At least it must be decided regarding these three features:

1) The RSARTE migration feature
2) The textual UML-RT feature
3) The ELK related features

Currently in the RCP build 2 is included but not 1 and 3. The Oomph end-user setup file has not yet been updated for 1.0 so whenever it is updated it should be aligned with what is decided goes into the RCP. The Oomph tester setup file currently only have 2 included and not 1 and 3.

Both 1 and 2 are currently marked as beta (since it was concluded that components could be not be left in incubation). I guess we should be consistent and either include both 1 and 2 or none of them.

3 is third party features still incubation so it should probably just be decided that they will not go into the 1.0 release (and ELK has not been used during testing either so including it this late in the release cycle could probably impact the layout in possibly unsuspected ways e.g. as discussed in Bug 506265.",21,"0"

"SIRIUS-491251","Isolate the dependency on EMF Transaction in Sirius","Currently Sirius leaks its dependency on EMF Transaction (specifically the need for a TransactionalEditingDomain) to the EEF 1.6 runtime. However it should be possible to use the EEF 1.6 runtime even in non-Sirius contexts which do not use EMF Transaction.

We should encapsulate this dependency on the Sirius side. The only actual requirements we have on the EEF side are:
1. a mean to execute operations which will have side-effects on the underlying model in a way that integrates with the source context (e.g. the editor from which the current input was selected)
2. a mean to detect changes in the EMF model which were done outside of the properties view while it is showing parts of that model so that the view can react by refreshing itself and not show an out-of-date state.

Currently these are implemented using:
1. TransactionalEditingDomain.getCommandStack().execute(new RecordingCommand() {
     // The code to execute
   })
2. Registering a post-commit listener on the TED's ResourceSet.

Both mechanisms should be abstracted and the TED-specific implementation provided by the Sirius side so that EEF only deals with the abstraction.",12,"0"

"BIRT-202963","DVT33:TCT760: SVE Multiple issues in birt-24-4.html in DVT update","Anders Bohman at 2007.09.11.05.29.40 
There seems to be multiple issues in the birt-24-4.html file which is part of the WSW33ABD001 IES_3.3_DOC5_delta DVT update:

1) The IReportDesign object provides the methods listed in
There seems to be a missing link here unless it's inserted at runtime.

2) As the table illustrates you retrieve several types of report elements by name including any report element whose interface extends IReportElement.
There seems to be a missing table here unless the table references (and table) are inserted at runtime.

3) The only way to get an instance of any of these objects is by writing an onPrepare( ) event handler
Either there is a missing part of this sentence or just a missing period.

4) SimpleElementFactory has the methods listed in
There seems to be a missing link here unless it's inserted at runtime.

5) IAction is a wrapper for ActionHandle and IAction ontains a subset of the methods of ActionHandle.
I'm assuming that ontains should really be contains. Please update the file if so.

6) Table 24-14 lists all the simple API elements that you can access and where to get an instance of each.
There seems to be a missing table here unless the table references (and table) are inserted at runtime.

Subject: [cdt-dev] Pulling an if check out of the loop in PDOMSearchResult.computeContainedMatches()
 

In the following piece of code could the if (filename.equals(mfilename)) check be moved out into the outer loop using 
((PDOMSearchElement) elements[i]).getFileName() to populate mfileName? The inner loop would then be entered only for the required file? If not why not? 

        private Match[] computeContainedMatches(AbstractTextSearchResult result String filename) throws CoreException { 
                List list = new ArrayList() 
                Object[] elements = result.getElements() 
                for (int i = 0 i < elements.length ++i) { 
                        Match[] matches = result.getMatches(elements[i]) 
                        for (int j = 0 j < matches.length ++j) { 
                                if (matches[j] instanceof PDOMSearchMatch) { 
                                        String mfilename = ((PDOMSearchMatch)matches[j]).getFileName()

"PLATFORM-506166","Print Margin painted at the wrong position on Retina Mac with Font Monaco 11","DESCRIPTION:
On a Macbook Pro with Retina display and macOS Sierra with the (fixed width) font Monaco 11 the print margin is printed in the wrong position.

ANALYSIS:
The average character width for this configuration is 6.5 but org.eclipse.swt.graphics.FontMetrics.getAverageCharWidth() is an integer value so this gets rounded down. 
In org.eclipse.jface.text.MarginPainter.computeWidgetX() this rounded value is multiplied by the column number so fCachedWidgetX is 
(column number)/2 pixels too low.

PATCH (via gerrit):
Don't use org.eclipse.swt.graphics.FontMetrics.getAverageCharWidth() in org.eclipse.jface.text.MarginPainter.computeWidgetX() but use org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.textExtent(String) to measure the width of an appropriate string (similar to how it is done in the computation of the value for FontMetrics.getAverageCharWidth)",511,"1"

For 2.0 we do not support custom selection (ie. only what matches user

I found in the wiki the following suggestion:

 In case the JVM cannot find/load the native libraries try passing the java.library.path to the VM. Right click on the Kura_Emulator_Linux.launch select Run As | Run Configurations select the Arguments tab and add the system property to the VM Arguments. For example for a 64 bit Linux add:

-Djava.library.path=${workspace_loc}/kura/kura/org.eclipse.kura.linux/lib/linux/x86/linux64

Unfortunately I cannot find the folder 'org.eclipse.kura.linux'.
Would you have any idea to help me fix my issue?

"GEF-487274","Add support for rendering cubic B-spline connections.","As a prerequisite to visualizing GraphViz layout information (see bug #487253) we would need to support rendering cubic B-splines (as Graphviz provides layout information for connections as such). 

In general that could be achieved through GEF4 FX's Connection (and a spline-based IConnectionRouter implementation we would have to add). However currently the curve's points are interpreted as start end and waypoints whereas in this situation they would have to be interpreted as start end and control points. 

We should investigate whether we can generalize Connection to this extend. Maybe it would be sufficient to change the wording. In either case we would have to ensure that a transaction policy that manipulates the curve (e.g. FXBendConnectionPolicy) respects the interpretation of the router or only supports certain routers (e.g. only those that assume points are interpreted as waypoints). We will probably have to extend the IConnectionRouterInterface to provide information about.

If the Connection is capable of supporting both interpretations in addition to the currently waypoint-based bending of connections we could also think of supporting control-point based bending as well (through control-point handles instead of waypoint handles). We would either have to augment FXBendConnectionPolicy to this extend or provide an alternative and add some handle-based interaction policy that uses it.",26,"0"

However the new stylesheet gives text properties to the  tag (i.e. black

Following a plugin-install link isn't working for me.. Although it does drive
the page to the Plugins category the 'install' param collector doesn't appear
so I can't proceed. Perhaps some recent change caused the command to not be
associated with the 'installPlugin' URI binding?

Strangely the param collector does appear if you do this:
1. Go to /settings/settings.html#category=general
2. Go to
/settings/settings.html#category=pluginsinstallPlugin=http://mamacdon.github.com/outliner/outlinerPlugin.html
 (notice that the whole page doesn't reload it's just a hash change).

Somehow a soft load (hash change) activates the param collector. A hard load
does not.",0,"0"

Note that this is only a problem when you start a ripple. Restarting works from anywhere(any safe restart point) assuming you haven't wiped your integration repo in between the failure and the restart.

A possible solution may lie in the ivy resolver settings.

"Z_ARCHIVED-160564","Agent Controller with compatibilty layer does not reliably support repeated connection attempts","We've been getting a number of reliablity defects filed during our consuming product's system test using the new AC.  I have been running this down for several days and the good news is that I now have a readily reproducible test case showing the type of failure we've been encountering.  Hopefully it's the same problem.

I have no reason to assume that this is caused by the compatibility layer -- I only mention that we are connecting to the new AC using the org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect() method which uses the compatibility layer.

Attached is a plugin that you can drop into a TPTP workbench.  It adds a new menu called ACDiag with a menu item called Session Connect.  (There's also a button with the eclipse icon added that does the same thing.) Choosing this action you will be prompted for the hostname to connect to the number of times you want to connect & release and the number of milliseconds to sleep between connect attempts.  The connections are done in series with a sleep() call of the specified length between each release and subsequent connect call (unless you specify 0 for the pause time in which case no sleep call is made.)  The plugin opens a console window (called AC Session Console) to print its output.  It prints each successful connect & release call and if an exception is thrown it prints the stack trace.

Running this plugin with the new agent controller either locally or remotely and taking the default values for iterations (20) and pause time (0) we consistently fail to connect somewhere between the 3rd and 13th connection (in my testing.)  Once we fail to connect the first time all subsequent connection attempts also fail and the AC appears to stop responding to others requests as well (for example calls to org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.NodeImpl.getPropertyValues(String String) return null presumably because they are eating the exception on line 428.)  Recycling the workbench instance does not return the Agent Controller to a good state -- you have to restart it for it to be usable again.

I find different things logged in the serviceconfig.log file when these failures happen.  Sometimes it appears that the AC stops writing to the log during this failure situation.  Other times I see any of the following suspicious entries:

1) PC handleProcessEvents: Process has exited with status 259.
2) Error writing to socket while sending message to client
3) Received(174 bytes).
    Validated message of 174 bytes

"PLATFORM-202712","Shell.setMaximized() not honored on GTK if bounds is set afterwards","Build ID: I20070621-1340

Steps To Reproduce:
When subclassing ApplicationWindow or any Dialog from JFace the windows won't programatically maximize. The snippet below works as expected on OSX and Windows but does nothing on GTK.

I'm using Ubuntu 7.04 with Gnome 2.18.1 and Emerald. I've also been able to reproduce the error with different versions of Gnome and other window managers (metacity).

Snippet28 (Maximize Shell) works properly on the same setup though. So the error is either in JFace - or in my presumptions on how this should work.

More information:
import org.eclipse.jface.window.ApplicationWindow
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*

public class JFaceMaximizeSnippet extends ApplicationWindow {

	public JFaceMaximizeSnippet(Shell parentShell) {
		super(parentShell)
	}

	@Override
	protected Control createContents(Composite parent) {
		getShell().setMaximized(true)
		return parent
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		JFaceMaximizeSnippet window = new JFaceMaximizeSnippet(null)
		window.setBlockOnOpen(true)

"PLATFORM-87363","Regression: MenuDetect no longer opens new menus","Bug introduced Nov 5 2004.

Prior to change Control.showMenu did this:

boolean showMenu (int x int y) {
	Event event = new Event ()
	event.x = x
	event.y = y
	sendEvent (SWT.MenuDetect event)
	if (!event.doit) return true
	if (menu != null && !menu.isDisposed ()) {
		if (x != event.x || y != event.y) {
			menu.setLocation (event.x event.y)
		}
		menu.setVisible (true)
		return true
	}
	return false
}

If a menu was created during the MenuDetect listener notification the menu 
field was updated and the menu was set visible.

After Nov 5 2004 the method was moved to Widget and now looks like this:

boolean showMenu (Menu menu int x int y) {
	Event event = new Event ()
	event.x = x
	event.y = y
	sendEvent (SWT.MenuDetect event)
	if (!event.doit) return true
	if (menu != null && !menu.isDisposed ()) {
		if (x != event.x || y != event.y) {
			menu.setLocation (event.x event.y)
		}
		menu.setVisible (true)
		return true
	}
	return false
}

Since menu is just a local variable it is not updated when a menu is created 
in the MenuDetect event.

The following example demonstrates the problem:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display()
	final Shell shell = new Shell(display)
	shell.addListener(SWT.MenuDetect new Listener() {
		int count = 0
		public void handleEvent(Event event) {
			Menu menu = shell.getMenu()
			if (menu != null) menu.dispose()
			menu = new Menu(shell SWT.POP_UP)
			MenuItem item = new MenuItem(menu SWT.PUSH)
			item.setText(Menu  + count++)
			shell.setMenu(menu)
		}
	})
	shell.pack()
	shell.open()
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep()
	}
	display.dispose()

I do not see any right now and see inconsistencies with jgit and lot of complicated code which is happy to brake at first possible occasion.

So here are my issues with this code:
1) I do not see broken links because Eclipse can't see them (yet see bug 290318)
2) The iterator relies on workspace resource model which can be out-of-date to the file system.
3) It has to deal with Eclipse filters links etc which all do not exist in real file system.
4) I do not see where it's Eclipse resource model is really *needed*. For example if I simply replace ContainerTreeIterator with AdaptableFileTreeIterator and don't return any ContainerTreeIterator instances from AdaptableFileTreeIterator I still can work as before with staging view etc.",7,"0"

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Try typing in the filter field
2. Tree will try and update for each key press rather than delay 
3.


More information:
The ItemFilterDialog attempts to update the tree contents at every key stroke rather than waiting a second or so for the user to stop typing. This can be extremely annoying. I've recoded the listener to use a Job and an asyncExec. Each key stroke tells the job to wait 800 milliseconds before execution if the job is still waiting to run and another key stroke happens it resets the delay to 800. I've tested it and it performs much better on my system. The patch is enclosed.",7,"0"

[ ] Use 'bin' folder as default in new Java projects

The best way to describe why I would like this is to paste here a posting I 
just made to Eclipse Corner that describes how I work. You will notice that I 
have to do a couple of extra steps to get rid of the 'src' folder. I would just 
like to eliminate those extra steps. Here is the post:

When I run Eclipse I specify where I want my workspace to be i.e.
    C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe -data D:\Eclipse\target
So Eclipse stores all of my projects in D:\Eclipse\target even though
I am running it from C:\eclipse.

Of course the .java and .class files are all mixed together which I don't
like so when I create a Java project I tell Eclipse to create 'src' and 'bin'
folders. (Window -> Preferences -- Java  Use 'src' and 'bin' folders as 
default in new Java projects.)

Now for one final step which I do because I don't like the 'src' folder :
- First I delete the 'src' folder
- Then I modify the Properties of the Project (select project context menu ->
  Properties) and I also delete the 'src' folder from the Java Build Path -
  Source tab.
- After this I usually select Use the project as source folder in the
  Source tab (unless I want to have some other named source folders in the
  project (not 'src' ) in which case I just leave Use source folders
  contained in the project selected).

At this point I am ready to start adding packages to my project.
The compiler puts all of my .class files for the projet into the 'bin'
directory in:

More information:
This document contains guidelines for review of third party prerequisites specified by Eclipse projects. However in this document the word prerequisite is never used instead a non-standard abbrevation is used making this document somewhat difficult to read for native English speakers and extremely and unnecessarily difficult for non-native English speakers. Compounding the problem the abbreviation is used (incorrectly) as a gerund in one location.
I can understand that during the drafting and discussion of a guideline document the use of this type of abbreviation might facilitate discussions however in the final document to aid non-native English readers all such abbreviations should be removed and replaced with the fully spelled out word. This allow these readers to more quickly determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and allows machine translation systems to prepare more accurate summaries in a reader's native tongue.",756,"1"

The attached webex recordings show the following symptoms:

    When creating multiple data mappings editing any but the first entry makes the selection jump back to the first entry. You can make one change to any of the following data-mappings and upon setting the focus outside of the edited field (or tabbing out) the selection jumps back to the first element.
    The second symptom is much more critical: While creating multiple activities with the same number of data-mappings it was observed that sporadically the entire Data Flow properties page would display the data-mappings from another activity that had been edited before. The UUID in the second video shows this happening. This can lead to serious modelling mistakes for end-users.",0,"0"

The spawner creates a new program group by calling

the call to kill is replaced by killpg to destroy the whole process group.

"PLATFORM-275197","[CommonNavigator] NullPointerException - Working set actions don't appear in CNF client","Build ID: I20090430-2300

Steps To Reproduce:
While restoring the selection with the CNF the WorkingSetRootModeActionGroup tries to addActions(IMenuManager viewMenu) without having the actions created. The stack-trace shows more information on how that happens (and hopefully is enough to understand it).

The point where this happens is when a client (pydev package explorer) tries to restore the selection right after starting eclipse.

Also this doesn't always happen (so it seems like it's a racing condition). The actions are created at setShowTopLevelWorkingSets() but it seems that this method is called only after the addActions() sometimes.

More information:

This may be a non-standard use of file extensions in PHP but it is certainly not illigal and being unable to name files how I want is certainly a bug.
Additionally the spelling of illegal needs to be corrected!

supposed to obtain that? I didn't realize that I needed to trigger that as a
conversation in the dev channel.  Nor did I know what to say.  All of that kind

Hi Barb

There was only initial contribution
https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1355.
Should that be included in the contribution section?
Only committers on this component contributed.

1. Could you please check the attached about file for LPG usage whether all that is needed is included?
   I will then provide the same for 'org.eclipse.m2m.qvt.oml.editor.ui'
plugin which also contains
   LPG grammar files and generated parser.
2. We do not use Antlr Runtime looks like CQ1548 is related to M2M/ATL component only.

Thanks & Regards

suggested fix

In the Add Patient form of the web interface the default ID is 12ab78 which appears to match the default in the simulator. So you accept the defaults and hit create and then submit a reading via the simulator front end. What happens is that no readings show up in the front end if you've selected the patient.

What hasn't been made obvious is that this ID is not a hex number but instead is a case-sensitive string! The front end actually uses a string of 12AB78 which doesn't match the patient's actual ID 12ab78. Until this can be noted in the eventual documentation I suggest changing the default value in the web interface so that it will match the default value from the simulator (or vice versa).",63,"0"

/**
 * Drag and Drop Operation: a copy of the data is added to the drop target and 
 * the drag source removes the original data and any references to the data

"MYLYN-294847","Unable to drag unsubmitted tasks in scheduled task presentation","Normally I use the feature to drag and drop task from one day into another in the Scheduled task presentation. But unsubmitted tasks this does not seem to work.

h1. Use Case

# During the work on a specific task I found some issue I want to write away e.g. write some sketches shortly to get them out of the way.
# To remind me of working out the task details later I create an unsubmitted task with a title and some content and schedule it for today or this week.
# Then I pick up the unsubmitted task later finish details and subscription and submit it.

Now I wanted to move these unsubmitted tasks from Today to This Week in the Scheduled presentation.
But while I could drag one or more submitted tasks dragging an unsubmitted did not work.

h1. Steps to reproduce

# Create unsubmitted task.
# Schedule unsubmitted task for today.
# Switch to Scheduled presentation.
# Try to drag the unsubmitted task from one day to another.

I tested this both with Trac tasks and with this Bugzilla task -- same behaviour.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an EAR project TestEAR 
2. Add an external jar to the EAR project using the Java EE Module Dependencies page
3. Add/Share the projects to ClearCase
4. Open the properties of the EAR project and go to the Java EE Module Dependencies page
5. Remove the external jar from the list.
  -> The JAR is physically removed from the filesystem

files. Include files per se and source files that are not built will not have
any discovered scanner info associated.

For Indexer client this situation is more or less OK header files are allways
parsed in context of some source file while not compiled source files are not
indexed. However there are other parser clients that require parsing of header
files on their own. This parsing is bound to fail (create a load of problems)
since there is no scanner info to be used during the parse. Parsing stand alone
header files has other chalanges as well: which language dialect to use C or
C++ which built-in scanner info to use C or C++ etc.

There are several solutions to the problem unfortunately all decrease parsing
correctness:

1. Use only compiler internal scanner info assume language dialect of the
project nature.
2. Use project scanner info (equal to sum of all scanner info for all source
files) assume language dialect of the project nature.
3. Try to figure out which source files include respective header file and use
scanner info associated with one of them. - This seems to be too expensive
operation - requires accessing the index if it exists.

From my chair it looks like we are better of with option 2 which effectively
reduces parsing correctness to the same level we have with per project scanner info.

"RIENA-317825","Riena throws ApplicationModelFailure when disposing nodes without viewId or workaredefinition","In a demo application I did not enter values for all nodes of submodules. That worked fine since I never activated these views. When I close the application an exception is thrown because the system wants to hide the views and creates the views even though they were never activated and therefore created....

The code that does this is this one:

SubApplicationView:

		@Override
		public void disposed(final ISubModuleNode source) {
			// not selectable SubModules dont't have an associated view and therefore no view has to be hidden
			if (source.isSelectable()) {
				final SwtViewId id = getViewId(source)
				hideView(id)
				final SwtViewProvider viewProvider = SwtViewProvider.getInstance()
				viewProvider.unregisterSwtViewId(source)
			}
		}

The Subapplication is called to dispose all SubModuleNode. The method getViewId(source) resolves the viewId and will actually create the view it may never have been activated. It also fails if there is no such view Id for a specific node is defined in the assembly for Rapid Prototyping.

The exception is this:

"GMF-RUNTIME-154982","Cairo is not available on Sun Solaris","Hi

GMF seems to be highly dependent on Cairo graphics library
but unfortunately Cairo binaries are not available on Sun solaris platform
When I try building cairo libraries I get no of errors.
I have filed this build issue with Cairo
(https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7551)
But frankly I don't get proper solution. Instead I was asked to
build/configure my Sun machine itself.

When I did a google search I see that I am not the only person
who is having build problem with cairo on sun platform.

I simply can't not use GMF on Sun machine just because of cairo
dependency. All other features/dependencies of GMF are well in place.

So I suggest that GMF should remove this cairo dependency and instead look
for other alternative graphics library.
I raised this issue in newsgroup as well but didn't get any response.
Pl suggest me any solution/workaround.

I am using GMF 1.0RC5 with Eclipse3.2R7.

Thanx

The TOC Editor allows dragging of files into the TOC's tree to make new Topics and Links. Currently all XML files can be dropped into the TOC as links but only TOC XML files should be allowed as drops.

In other words you are currently able to drop both a toc.xml and a plugin.xml creating links out of both. However you should only be able to drop toc.xml.",14,"0"

"COMMUNITY-261365","Clarify that EPP packages are not supported products","In the December Board Meeting [1][2] the Eclipse Board of Directors decided that there should be more clarification indicating that the EPP packages are not supported products.

The Architecture Council has picked up this discussion in its January Meeting [3] and some interesting new ideas were collected but we didn't come to a full conclusion. I believe that the issue is really more something for the Planning Council to address since it directly affects the release train and its perception in the Community. It seems less related to any technical issues.

Other ideas included clarifying the state of the packages in a positive way (Jeff: the package is available FOR FREE) or similar to the recent Windows-7 beta (Martin: Your comments and suggestions on bugzilla are very valuable for us but we cannot guarantee any response) or by showing member ads for commercial products in a report a bug wizard. 

For now I'm putting this bug on cross-project for further discussion though this might not be its final destination since EPP and Phoenix/Website may also be affected.

I manually copy the class files compiled by eclipse into a jar file.
I can put breakpoints properly in the code that means that the thread is 
suspended when the breakpoint is reached but the source files in the project 
folder are not recognized as valid. 
To attach a source file i must explicitly indicate the project folder but 
this way i get 2 source views in the debugger perspective one from the 
project called myservlet.java and one from the attached source folder 
called myservlet.class. Breakpoints set in one view are not visible in the 
other.
Why eclipse was not able to recognize the source file?

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Generate a GMF editor from the *.gmfgen model

3. Regenerate from the *.gmfmap model the *.gmfgem model and then generate again the GMF editor from the *.gmfgen model.

"COMMUNITY-464530","[pmi] Autocomplete does not find new users","We provide some autocomplete functionality to help specify project leads and mentors in project proposals and candidates for committer elections.

This autocomplete feature when  created was designed to work with the user profile extension. We replaced that implementation a couple of months ago but the implementation of the autocomplete was not updated. As it exists now the autocomplete only matches based on the old data that we have for users that were created while we were still using the user profile extension. New users are not found.

The use of autocomplete is actually problematic. Only users who have actually logged into the particular PMI instance can be found using it regardless of whether or not they have an Eclipse Foundation account. It would be better perhaps to specify the user by email address and check to see if we have an account using that address. This would decrease the surprise factor of our system not being able to find a user who is known to have an account. 

In the meantime the autocomplete functionality needs to be fixed to use the new fields.",120,"1"
"TARGET_MANAGEMENT-343939","DBCS3.7 DBCS characters are corrupted in Files","Build Identifier: I20110412-2200

DBCS file names are placed in remote system. When connecting the remote server from Eclipse the DBCS files in remote server are corrupted. The code page information of remote system property shows system default code page MS932. As MS932 is Japanese Windows code page the connection property may be good. I'm not sure Windows' rseserver handles DBCS file names.

The following code in uploadResourcesFromWorkspace() tries to refresh the targetFolder. But getRemoteFileObject() assumes the file structure is a hierarchic one and tries to re-get the file from its parent. Since zVM files is a flat list it returns null and targetFolder.canWrite() throws NPE. It's very similar to the problem reported in bug 398988.

Hi

The unit of length is missing for option
Display Ellipsis when the value length exceeds XX

Steps to reproduce
1)  Start Eclipse and change the Perspective to Database Development Perspective from Window->Open Perspective->Other?
2)  When the Database Development Perspective opens verify the Data Source Explorer (DSE) opens.  It should contain the Databases folder
3)  Open the Project Explorer View by selecting Window -> Show View -> Other... expand the General folder and select Project Explorer
4)  Create a project named test by selecting File -> New -> Project... expand the General folder and select Project.
5)  Open the Preference pages for SQL Development by selecting Window -> Preferences expand Data Management -> SQL Development
6)  Expand SQL Results View Options and select Viewer Options

Please investigate

Thanks

 nguyer at 2010.05.04.08.16.12 
I checked this and you are correct that there are no units explicitly stated however it is implied that the integer value is the number of characters in the value. Many of the other input fields in the View preferences are similar to this. Personally I do not think this is a problem but others may disagree. What do you think?

 martine marin at 2010.05.05.09.01.40 
Hi

I would rephrase it since the value is an integer but does it mean a number of rows bytes kilobytes characters we don't know

Thanks

"RAP-340482","[ClassUtil]: Proposal of a less intrusive Exception Handling","Created attachment 191564
ClassUtil refactoring

Doing some work on RWT internals I found the class org.eclipse.rwt.internal.util.ClassUtil. I agree very much with the objective of that class. Providing an abstraction for loading and creating an instance of a certain type reflectivly is used at several locations in RWT. I also agree with the idea of introducing an special exception class to hide all the exception types involved by the reflection stuff.

But I think in case problems occur in the reflectivly invoked constructor itself treatment of that exceptions should be a little bit more sophisticated. In case of runtime exceptions I don't want any nested stacktrace at all. I want the stacktrace to point me directly to that line of the constructor that causes the problem.

In case of checked exceptions I can not rethrow this exceptions of course. But having a ClassInstantiationException wrapping a InvocationTargetException that contains the original problem seem also a little bit overwhelming to me. I would prefer the InvocationTargetException to be eliminated.

So I've created an additional test and changed the exception handling accordingly. Please have a look at the attached patch with those changes.

Currently this does not work because the manifest localization is initialized before the Framework knows that fragments exist for the system bundle.  There are a few callers to Bundle.getHeaders() to initialize some service properties before we load the resolver state.  This results in the following headers not being translated:

Bundle-Description: %systemBundle
Bundle-Copyright: %copyright
Bundle-Vendor: %eclipse.org

Currently SystemBundle.getHeaders() is called to get the bundle-vendor for service properties that are registered by the system.bundle.  I don't think Bundle-Vendor should be translated.  Shouldn't the Bundle-Vendor be Eclipse.org in every language?

This is not very helpful since this might actually be a valid issue and they'd have to dig through Bugzilla to find out. It gets a little better when I enter a custom resolution message but then looks pretty contradictory as a result:

It would be awesome if the server would actually send the same response as it would for the original problem for which this is a duplicate which might even already have a custom message with a workaround - or in case of a Bugzilla issue reconnect the problem to the proper bugzilla issue.

As a stop-gap measure maybe the full text of the server response could be changed for duplicates. E.g. if a custom message is available just remove the This problem has been marked as ignored/ignorable i.e. it is not considered as bug. part.

However the descriptions aren't set and there still appears to be content in them e.g. https://git.eclipse.org/c/e4/eclipse.platform.ui.e4.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench

The problem is that a naive Google search will bring up these locations instead of the real locations for code bases.

I suggest that for repositories which are not active any more the following is done:

1. The description is changed to point to the new location e.g. This repository has been moved to /eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui
2. The repository's contents (on the master branch) are deleted and replaced with a README.md or README.txt file that says This repository has been moved to /eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui

That way Google won't index the default (master) branch and users browsing the website will not see the content in the wrong place. The git repository will of course still have the content available (in both the commit log and in other tags/branches) but upon first glance users won't think it's still the active one.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Write a ManagedService that throws a NullPointerException from its updated() method
2. Try to modify its configuration through the org.eclipse.equinox.cm bundle. This will trigger the NullPointerException
3. Note that the thread performing updates to ManagedServices has died and will no longer update ManagedServices


More information:
The problem is in the implementation of the method asyncUpdated(ManagedService Dictionary) of class org.eclipse.equinox.cm.internal.ConfigurationAdminFactory$ManagedServiceTracker.

Whenever a ManagedService must be updated this method schedules a Runnable to perform the update with a queue. This (anonymous) Runnable does catch ConfigurationExceptions but it does not catch unchecked exceptions. As the bundle is calling into another bundle it's reasonable to catch any Exception or even Throwable here especially because failing to do so causes the entire CM implementation to stop working.",2,"0"

The triple oslc:propertyDefinition should be omitted entirely.  Its presence would asserts that the subject shape contains constraints about the usage of oslc_auto:parameterDefinition in your implementation but this shape contains constraints about *your parameter* on *your Auto Plan*.  Since Automation Plan parameters are not namespace-qualified oslc:propertyDefinition is omitted for them.

As all three instances of EvaluationContextManager run independent of each other the last one registered will win the race.
More often than not the winner is not TCF and above menu items don't appear in the editor in spite of an active TCF debug session.

As a short-term solution I'd propose to make sure the TCF EvaluationContextManager is registered last and does not override the system property set by other front ends.

Re: [jgit-dev] Avoiding stat calls (again)
13 nov 2010 kl. 16:36 skrev Robin Rosenberg:

This issue pops up again and again I guess when one stops being tired of it. I got an idea that does not involve JNI.

If the time stamp hasn't changed couldn't we assume size didn't change either? I believe
all OS:es update the timestamp when we write to a file not just on open/close.

Given some definition of old we could avoid retrieving the file size if the (old) timestamp
in the index equals the one on disk when checking for a possible modification. 

What would old be? 2 seconds (FAT) or much more?

See the Gerrit http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change1905. The main thing I wanted was to make the Commit
dialog pop up faster. Now what I found is that it actually opens and read every file No wonder it
takes forever. Git is supposed to be fast.

The TreeWalk needs a better interface to the TreeIterators to support this cleanly and TreeWalk
must be able to receive parameters regarding how to compare with regards to filemode and crlf etc.

I think we need to break the TreeWalk API. Let's suprise Shawn when he gets back from vacation }:>

"CDT-302916","Implement TCF IRegisters service to make EDC more flexible in supporting new registers","Currently EDC uses ISimpleRegisters TCF service for register access to agent.
And implementation of DSF IRegisters service describes what registers and
register groups are supported. That dictates for different targets (ARM and x86
so far) we have to implement DSF IRegisters service differently. It also
dictates what registers and register groups an agent can & has to support. That
puts unnecessary restriction on agent implementation and make it hard to add
new register support.

It would be nice if we can get register description from agent. Good thing is 
TCF IRegisters service offers a mechanism to get the registers description
(a hierarchy of thread->groups->Registers->Bitfields (part of one register))
from agent which if implemented should rid the host debugger (the DSF
Registers service) of any target dependent registers description. Also the TCF
IRegisters service has a way to describe which register is PC register (or
Stack Pointer Frame Pointer register). With that we can have a target
independent way of getting PC (or SP FP) in DSF code. With that approach
agent would have the full control of what registers to support making EDC more
target neutral and more flexible.

first error

Build ID: galileo RC4

Steps To Reproduce:
install the Galileo 3.5 RC4 Java EE bundle.
Use the New Server dialog and click the Download Additional server adapters link.
After a while you'll see adapters you can download.

Try the Geronimo or BEA or WebSphere Adapter.
You'll get an error (see attached image)

Try the GlassFish Java EE adapter. You can go a little bit further accept the license but this is failing as well with another error (see image).

The site.xml are correct and working with Eclipse 3.4 very well. So it is a regression from Eclipse 3.4.
Regressions are P2 I think

(1) A commandline option -flush is submitted to the QTest executable which is unknonw. I was not able to find it in the QTest doc for 4.8 also.

I tried to run the Eclipse tests in debug mode using a .option file that sets all debug option to true.
I ended up with:

Looking at the code it looks like iter.next() should be replaced with value.
I'll provide a patch for this.

If the patch is ok it would be nice to get it released for next I-build as I would like to be able to collect code coverage data in debug mode.",0,"0"

"PLATFORM-4733","Issues with Win32 GDI setBkMode() and similar things in Motif (1GFPGK3)","A few issues related to how we're using setBkMode()
	1. SWT never explicitly calls setBkMode(OS.OPAQUE) during initialization
		but it assumes that it has been set to that during GC operations.
		-- see the non-transparent branches of drawText() and drawString()
	2. When the background mode is opaque and the current line style is anything
		other than LINE_SOLID the background colour is used to paint the blank
		spaces between dots and dashes.
	3. There is no API for selecting a transparent background colour (and Windows
		doesn't really have such a thing for drawing operations) so there is no
		way to specify that we want to draw dotted lines with transparent spaces.

	The API (JavaDoc) makes no mention of this being the intended behaviour.
	A quick test on Motif shows that we're doing the exact same thing over there...

	Recommend we add API for transparent dotted lines by adding new bit flags
	SWT.LINE_TRANSPARENT_DASH and SWT.LINE_ALTERNATE_DASH.
	Choose one of them to be the default behaviour (so its value will be 0).
	Extend the GC get/setLineStyle() to use a style value that consists of the
	logical OR of one of the existing SWT.LINE_xxx styles and one of the
	above flags.

		Motif: specify LineOnOffDash or LineDoubleDash in the line attributes
			structure element from setLineStyle().
		Photon: only supports transparent gaps!

"PLATFORM-125250","[doc] JNI Cannot Find Java Routines with RCP","Hopefully this has been submitted in the right place and with the
right priority.  (It is a stopper for me.)

I have an RCP application that uses SWT and a JNI package of my own.
I also have a stand-alone SWT version that does essentially the same
thing.  In both of these the JNI part can be replaced with a pure
Java implementation.  Apart from a switch that uses the full Java
version or not they all use the same package.  The JNI implementation
is old code that has been working for some time both in and out of
Eclipse.  All of these versions work except the RCP application using
JNI.  That is it is not a bug in the package nor in making the RCP
product.

The RCP JNI version fails eventually giving an exception because the
C routine FindClass in the following C++ code returns null:

extern C {
  static int theMessageCallback(const char* pFormat va_list args) {
    jobject callback= (jobject) epicsThreadPrivateGet(messageCallbackID)
    if (callback==NULL) return ECA_NORMAL
    JNIEnv* env

    _jvm->AttachCurrentThread((void**)

    char buf[1024]
    sprintf(buf pFormat args)
    jstring msg= env->NewStringUTF(buf)

    jclass clazz = env->FindClass(gov/aps/jca/jni/JNIContextMessageCallback)

    jmethodID methodID = env->GetMethodID(clazz fire
      (Ljava/lang/String)V)
    env->CallVoidMethod(callback methodID  msg)
    _jvm->DetachCurrentThread()
    return ECA_NORMAL
  }
}

This is a C callback and the idea is to call the Java callback with
the string from the arguments.  (The problem is that clazz is null.
env is not null.)  The callback gets called from code in another DLL
that is independent of the JNI wrappers.  That library knows nothing
about Java and the callback prototype doesn't have an env as an
argument.  It calls the Java routine that will handle the callback in
Java getting the env from the thread.  This is different from what is
more commonly done which is to have a C implementation of a Java
class that gets passed the env which (indirectly) knows about the
class.

The reason it fails is that the C function FindClass which is purely
J2SDK not Eclipse uses the classpath to find the class.  With an RCP
application Eclipse apparently uses /startup.jar as the
classpath.  This is determined by printing out java.class.path from
the running app.  startup.jar has very little in it and little if
anything that is specific to the particular RCP app.  Consequently
FindClass does not find the class in this case (because it is not in
the classpath).  The RCP app does find the other classes in whatever
manner Eclipse uses to locate jars in plug-ins presumably using its
own classloaders.  It works OK until the above C callback gets called.

The reason it works standalone (not a plug-in in an RCP app) is that I
specify the classpath specifically to include that jar and FindClass
uses that classpath and finds it.  (The reason it works with the pure
Java version is that FindClass is not used.)

I was unable to get the RCP app to use my classpath for instance by
specifying it in vmargs or myapp.ini.  Eclipse apparently *overwrites*
the classpath with the above.  I would consider this also to be a bug.
It should append or use what is specified on the command line (which
could include startup.jar).

I can make it work by manually putting the package in startup.jar.
This allows FindClass to locate it in the classpath (while Eclipse
apparently finds it in the plugin directory since the jar files are
really in another plug-in).  This is not a good solution
(if for no other reason than that the class is in two places now) but
it demonstrates the problem which seems to be that FindClass does not
work in the Eclipse environment when called from C or C++ code that is
not directly part of the native implementation of a Java method and
that the reason is because the J2SDK FindClass cannot find the class
as Eclipse can.

This is a stopper for me.  It is a reasonable and straightforward
thing to do.  I think it is an oversight in the Eclipse
implementation.

I cannot change the implementation as it is not my code.  In
addition it is a correct JNI implementation.

I apologize for this being long.  The problem is somewhat deep and
hard to easily understand.  I would be happy to elucidate if
necessary.",127,"1"

Version: Oxygen (4.7)
Build id: I20170612-0950

Implementation of IWorkbenchPage.getViewStack doesn't seems to support views with a secondary id.

Debugging the search process a bit I found that getViewStack takes the id from IViewPart.getSite().getId() and compares it with the part id returned from the model which have the secondary id so it always fails.

The fix should be really easy and quick just append the secondary id if not null.",89,"0"
"PTP-292297","Problem with Minimize ONLY List refactoring","Kurt

Another one for you.  :-)

program1.f90 does not have an ONLY clause.  If you ask it to minimize the ONLY list it removes the USE statement entirely which is obviously incorrect.  It should throw a precondition failure instead.

program2.f90 has the correct only clause but minimizing it (which should give you only: used) removes the ONLY clause entirely.

program3.f90 should minimize the list to only: whatever => used but it instead gives only: unused

"ORBIT-368999","Orbit's repo should have optional dependencies as non-greedy by default.","Once bug 361067 is fixed we will be poised to move up to a more recent p2 publisher that specifies greedy=false for optional dependencies. (If not specified p2 assumes greedy=true).

for some background and descriptions of this issue. 

I think we will get the desired publishing behavior for free (once we move up) but this might impact some Orbit bundles where greedy=true is required. I am not aware of any such cases ... but this bug will serve as a good place to document general issues on this topic if any are found.",1,"0"

If you run Eclipse in Japanese and open the 'General' -> 'Startup and Shutdown' preference page you will see 'Automatic Updates Scheduler' (in English) as one of the plugins that should be activated on startup. 

'Automatic Updates Scheduler' is the plugin name for org.eclipse update.scheduler. 
I've examined the language packs and 'Automatic Updates Scheduler' appears in English in the plugin_ja.properties file in the org.eclipse.update.scheduler.nl1 fragment. 

By the way the plugin name is properly translated in German and several other languages just not in Japanese.",1735,"1"

We are using AspectJ in an application combined with Spring to do dependency injection via the Aspects.aspectOf() method and cannot currently move to java 1.5 due to platform support issues.

Hopefully this can be reverted to allow access to aspects in a 1.4 environment.

Also it's understandable why the annotations package is compiled with 1.5 but I was wondering why much of the reflection package is also compiled with 1.5 making much of it unusable in a 1.4 environment (although not all of it).  As far as packaging goes it was a bit strange to find out that a single jar file contains classes compiled with two different versions of the jdk.  It seems as though these should be refactored into their own jar files.",153,"1"

"CDT-511726","NPE in ClassTypeHelper.getBases() (called by CPPASTFieldReference.getFieldPosition())","I first encountered the error when upgrading from Eclipse Neon.1 (CDT 9.1.0) to Eclipse Neon.2 (CDT 9.2.0). It remained with Eclipse Oxygen M5 (CDT 9.3.0).
The error manifests itself in some header files not being indexed.

So far I have not been able to come up with a minimal test case that causes this error.
I hope the stack trace can already help you to see a potential problem

[FYI: I have isolated a code file x.cpp that includes its own header file x.h which in turn includes more header files. Unless x.h is stripped to its bare minimum it is not indexed. I remove content (including other header files) from x.h to find the exact cause. As soon as x.h is indexed I add the removed header and recurse. This process takes quite a while because after re-adding I have to reindex the whole project which is quite huge with a mostly header-only structure.]



Below I am attaching the error description of Eclipse Oxygen M5 (CDT 9.3.0):

I've done this several times before and one of the steps involves manually specifying the include path for the C++ indexer which I set to /w/chrome/src (the base directory of my chrome checkout).  Unfortunately the Eclipse 3.8/CDT 8.1.0.201205051543 indexer seems to ignore this path as all my chrome include files are unresolved.  It finds system files like  just fine.  Strangely the Project Properties > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols > Includes list is blank even when I check Show built-in values.  It used to show paths in /usr/include.

I did not have this problem with an older workspace I migrated from Eclipse 3.7.2/CDT 8.1.0.201203210135 to Eclipse 3.8/CDT 8.1.0.201205051543.  Likewise I can create a new workspace in Eclipse 3.7.2/CDT 8.1.0.201203210135 and it works fine.

I also tried adding paths via project properties > C/C++ General > Preprocessor Include Paths > Entries > GNU C++ > CDT User Setting Entities > Add... When I click OK then reopen the dialog the paths I added are lost (the section is blank in the UI).  The indexer does not find the paths either.",16,"0"
"EPF-281167","ID: Reorder steps on plan iteration so risk assessment precedes commitment","From Marianne Hollier/IBM

The steps on the Plan Iteration task do not appear to be in the most optimal order. We would expect that the order be the following since reviewing and addressing risks should be part of the estimation effort:

Prioritize Work Items List 
Define iteration objectives
Identify and review risks 
Commit work to the iteration
Define evaluation criteria 
Refine project definition and scope

Basically we think the risk step should come BEFORE the commit work step otherwise you might have to completely re-estimate and re-commit.",16,"0"

"JDT-28625","Huge number of warnings now generated by JDTCompilerAdapter","Between versions 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 JDTCompilerAdapter has changed the warnings 
produced by the compiler from:

-warn:constructorNamepackageDefaultMethodmaskedCatchBlocksdeprecation

to

-
warn:constructorNamepackageDefaultMethodmaskedCatchBlocksunusedLocalsunusedA
rgumentsunusedImportssyntheticAccessassertIdentifier

The addition of the extra options means that running Ant now generates a huge 
number of warnings on our source tree. The warnings are collected in the Log 
Console which seems to get slower and slower and our Ant build has become 
impossibly slow (it was less than 1 minute and is now over 20 minutes - at 
which point I killed the process).

We can work around the problem by using the Ant nowarn option to disable the 
warnings but we would ideally like to have some of the warnings turned on.

I'd be happy if the warnings were changed back to those used by v2.0.1. 
However perhaps it would be possible to use an Ant property to define the list 
of warnings? Ant's jikes wrapper does this for extra options (see the bottom of 
this page: http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/CoreTasks/javac.html ).",1,"0"

"WTP_SERVERTOOLS-263429","Error in ServerEditor extension points yields no useful info","If a section for the ServerEditor throws an exception for the main page of the ServerEditor the page is prevented from being created and then later fails with the following Exception visible in the Editor:

org.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: assertion failed: 
	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:111)
	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:97)

	at org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditorPart.createPartControl(MultiPageEditorPart.java:314)
	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorReference.createPartHelper(EditorReference.java:661)

This is because the ServerEditor (or multipageeditor) is trying to set the active page to page 0 which doesn't exist.  However this gives debuggers no useful information to figure out which editor extension point is the one that failed.

This is because ServerEditor.createPages() catches all exceptions and does not let any prropagate up to the MultiPageEditor via some type of RuntimeException. 

My proposed fix would fix that (though I believe you'll have some issues with the quality ) )  bit I'm not sure what a more clean fix would look like.  With my patch the proper exception can propagate up and is the one shown in the editor which helps in debugging (and I'm sure users would actually like to know what actually went wrong).   All I've done in the patch is re-throw the caught exceptions with a RuntimeException wrapper.

IFileStore.getChild() also throws an exception in this situation. This is problematic because the whole SFS subtree cann't be accessed anymore. It is also not possible to delete the corrupted content only that sometimes leads to a situation when the whole workspace has to be recreated. 

The fix should handle both aspects:
- The methods IFileStore.childStores() and IFileStore.getChild() should return the file store(s) but subsequently all methods of semantic file store that involve a content provider should throw an exception.
- A force removal methods and UI actions should be implementd to allow dedicated repair operations that forcefully remove corrupted content.",102,"0"

ToggleButtonRidget Shared View Patch

If a shared view contains some radio buttons with mandatory markers changing the controller can result in a wrong mandatory icon on the navigation tree. That happens because the ToggleButtonRidget set the visibility of the markers on his siblings which can still assigned on the old Controller.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the Example Client
2. Go to Playground
3. Enter a last name and select a gender
4. Select Node 3

Actual Results: 
Node 1 and Node 3 get a mandatory marker

Expected Results:
Node 3 get a mandatory marker",3,"0"

The work around is to select all text then change the entire Word document to landscape mode.  It's important to select all text as the BIRT emitter creates multiple sections - even if the report is only one table.

- modify parser logic to avoid frequent exceptions from castException()

A solution to that may an introduction of object that would represent certain entities in git logic. Here are some examples:
* WebClone (already have it)
* Branch
* Remote
* Diff
* Commit
* ...

All of them (except for the first one) would be derivative of a WebClone so they operate in a proper context. In other words a Diff object can be created only for an concrete WebClone. 

Each object will have a method to serialize it to JSON which would simplify creating responses. This should help fixing bug 345402 and bug 349290.",61,"0"

1. Tabs

2. Email
The fields checks the format of the text to be sure this is an email.

3. Confirmed
This is the status when a user change his email.
It can be orange if the user needs to do an action to confirm the email. We can add an other button like resend the confirmation email depending on the technical workflow.

4. Nickname
The nickname must be customisable. Some users have the same nickname on many communities on some services like Skype so they might want to have the same on eclipse.org to make it clear.
We need a workflow to check that the new nickname is available.

5. Available
This label inform when a nickname is available or not. Green with a check when available red with a cross when not available.
Other websites propose free alternatives like automatic derivatives (adding a number or an other information about the user) do we really need to do that?
Also we might want to put some rules. It is available for users who confirmed their email and perhaps already signed the ECA. If we enable this king of rules a tooltip or a message must be visible explaining what to do to be allowed to change the nickname. The field is disabled or gray and the tooltip is visible when the user try to edit it.

6. Timezone
Nothing special here we can do the same as usual.

7. Password

8. Weak & Match
The first label inform about the weakness of the password. Red is not acceptable Orange is Weak (but acceptable) Green is Good.

"COMMUNITY-490808","Close the gap between drupal and eclipse.org","We currently need to create a new menu.php header.php nav.php and footer.php for each theme. We also need to create a barebone.php and thin-header.php file.

This is error prone because for each update we need to update 3 themes. We should re-use the same menu.php header.php nav.php and footer.php. The theme class should be responsible for setting the proper css classes for each theme.

The goal for this bug is to close the gap between the work we are doing on eclipse.org and on all of our Drupal sites. Our ultimate goal here is that we should be building things that we can re-use regardless of the technology (We are already doing this with all of our CSS files). 

For example instead of hardcoding classes in the drupal solstice theme I will be able to re-use our Theme class to get the proper attributes for each element for the drupal theme. This way if we change the layout of the footer in eclipse.org the classes and id will be automatically sync with Drupal.

A button on the main toolbar solves this problem.

In fact the Java EE Perspective contains an Open web browser toolbar button just for this purpose. Please add an Open web browser with accessibility validation toolbar button to this group that when pressed brings up a dialog. The dialog offers the user the chance to open a file or a URL (two radio buttons). If file is selected a browse... button is enabled allowing the user to choose the file on the local file system to open in the browser. Once selected the file is entered as a URI in the text field provided. If the URL radio button is selected the user simply types in a URL in the edit field.

All of the repack (pack200 -r) unpack200 and jarsigner tools leave their results in slightly different formats with respect to the compression of the resulting jar (mostly around whether crc & size information goes before or after a record entry).  This may depend on the OS & VM used.  Because of this when nesting jars inside of something that is being signed the jarprocessor performs a normalization step on the nested jars to ensure that they are always the same.

skipping one of the normalization steps resulting in nested jars whose contents

From Andrew (primary)
1) Allow pocket PC shell behavior (no caption no size handles fills screen 
dont' resize title in nav bar)
2) Allow OK button/Smart Minimize for app closing.
3) Allow SIP/No SIP
4) Handle SIP activation for resize
5) Allow FullScreen shell style

(secondary)
6) handle application restart (i.e if app is already running show it again 
don't start it twice)
7) handle hardware keys (e.g. the 4 app buttons on an iPaq)

Note:
- can this be the default? (Shell Max no Title) for Pocket PC or do I have to 
set this manually?
- Shell Close == Smart Min is OK for 2002.  There is no Smart Min for Pocket PC 
< 2002 so I guess a person would be screwed on non 2002 versions. This is 
probably acceptable (although a pain for me personally with my iPaq ).

From Mike
- Allow pocket PC shell behavior (no caption no size handles fills screen 
dont' resize title in nav bar)
Maximized + shell.setText == title in nav bar

- Allow OK button/Smart Minimize for app closing.
Shell close button == presence of Smart min. OK button should be reserved for 
OK buttons in dialog.

- Allow SIP/No SIP
SIP on by default for Text editable Combo and StyledText

- Handle SIP activation for resize
shell should be sent resize messages even though it is max'ed.


Current status:
1) buggy when multiple frames
2) to 4)not done (smart minimize simply hides the app by default it does not 
close it - very confusing in our case - need to be handled)
6) not done
7) experimental support for hard keys - api not frozen yet",119,"1"

This is because the version numbers are compared lexicographically so that S appears after I.
It would be preferable simply to install a newer version of the integration build on top of a stable build via the update mechanism.
Therefore I would like to ask for a change of the name of the build:
from ${buildType}${buildTime} to ${buildTime}-${buildType} so that the S or I appears only at the end and the new date/time is recognized from the comparison first.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Go to Help > Software Updates
2. The dialog box has an inconsistent/confusing layout compared to the rest of the UI for Eclipse for both the Installed Software and Available Software tabs.
[See the more information section for explanation]


More information:
[Available Software Tab]

The Install button is positioned at the wrong place. Currently it is positioned in the topmost position amongst a row of other buttons. Instead it should be positioned at the bottom right corner together with the Cancel button.

I can't find the exact Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) clause for this but this  is close enough. It mentions that the action button has to be in the bottom-right corner.

Having the Install button at the top-right corner is confusing since it is supposed to be an action to be performed for the entire dialog unlike the other buttons (Properties Add site... Manage Sites... Refresh). 

I think this applies for Windows/Linux as well but I am not familiar enough with their HIG to provide a link.

The proper behavior was present in Eclipse 3.3/3.2 which makes me suspect that this was an honest mistake in creating the new Software Update dialog for Eclipse 3.4.

The proper behavior is also maintained throughout the other dialog boxes in the Eclipse UI.

"PDT-160456","Implement a path mapper!","Additionally there is no feature to enable mapped paths like there is with php dbg phpeclispe.

I have a path setup as follows:

C:\Projects\MyProject\
  + htdocs\
  + lib\
    + CMyClass.php

http://mybox/ has a DOCUMENT_ROOT set to C:\Projects\MyProject\htdocs\

Thus when I pick the index.php in the debug configuration screen it creates a url as follows:

http://mybox/htdocs/index.php

which is of course totally wrong.  The problem is that the current configuration dialog cannot cope with projects that either a) have a document root that is somewhere other than the root b) has a server that uses rewrite rules and c) has files that live outside of the project. (correct me if I'm wrong)

All files and urls needs to be passed though a mapper which is how php dbg  and phpeclipse works and it does it right 100% of the time even for compliated project layouts.

When the webserver opens a file it knows where the files are located as the debug module runs in the webserver the debug module can know about the urls and their absolute paths.  

the web server's debugger module should then send full path to the debug client in php ide then php ide should run this though a path mapper to determine the correct local paths.

using the scenario about i would have a path map as follows:

remote path => C:\Projects\MyProject\htdocs
local path => C:\Projects\MyProject\htdocs

notice something?  they're the same paths.  so why a path mapper you're asking.

If I moved my project from C:\Projects\MyProject to N:\Projects\MyProject and N: was a network drive on a remote webserver that had a url of http://dominic.remotebox which had a DOCUMENT_ROOT of D:\Share\Dominic\Projects\MyProject\htdocs I would create a mapping as follows:

remote path => D:\Share\Dominic\Projects\MyProject\htdocs
local path => N:\Projects\MyProject\htdocs

For complicated projects that have symlinked folders you normally need more than one mapping.  e.g. if you have 2 or more clients using a shared set of library code that lived on D:\Web\Common\Lib which was symlinked to by D:\Share\Dominic\Projects\MyProject\lib you would need another mapping as follows:

remote path => D:\Web\Common\Lib
local path => N:\Projects\MyProject\lib

Additionally rewrite rules are catered for here because the webserver's debugger module always knows the absolute path of the file being using as it takes place AFTER the rewrite rule has applied.

path mapping also opens the door for cross-platform remote debugging as the path mapper can translate unix style / relative paths into windows style drive letter relative paths too.

a path mapper only looks at the first part of the file being opened

so if (using my second example) i had file called

D:\Share\Dominic\Projects\MyProject\htdocs\anotherfolder\anotherentrypoint.php

it would only look at the paths in the path mapper's list before replacing with the local path to the file would be resolved to:

N:\Projects\MyProject\htdocs\anotherfolder\anotherentrypoint.php

Further more in the debug UI the url should probably NOT be automatically built as it doesn't make sense most of the time.  You could have a GUESS button to the right of the URL text box though.  

You should be able to specify the webserver's DOCUMENT ROOT (and optionally a context path).  The path mapper would use the document root to determine where to open files from it should also be the REMOTE WEBSERVER'S document root.  If the project's path and the document root are the same then no path mappings are required.

Please implement ASAP as this is a very important when doing anything other than basic php scripts/sites.  remember it's the larger sites that actually NEED a debugger so those are the ones you need to cater for!",326,"1"

reported in bugzilla 80730.

Importing a log file from a remote z/OS system may result in incomplete data

Importing a log file using Log and Trace Analyzer from a remote z/OS system may 
result in incomplete data shown in the Log View.  The import operation may stop 
prematurely and not all of the log records are shown in the Log View.  This 
problem occurs when one of the following IBM JDK versions is installed on the 
z/OS system:

1.4.1 PTF UQ88783
1.4.2 PTF UQ90449
1.4.2 PTF UQ93743

To work around this problem change the configuration of the Hyades Agent 
Controller on the z/OS system by doing the following:

1) Edit the file 
plugins/org.eclipse.hyades.logging.parsers/config/pluginconfig.xml in the Agent 
Controller install directory.
2) Add a new Parameter to the RemoteLogParserLoader Application element after 
the java.version parameter.  For example:



3) Restart the Agent Controller.
4) Import the log file again.",6,"0"

It took me a while to have setuid working as explained in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Port80#Using_Jetty.27s_setuid_feature .

Note: on Linux you want to use 'service jetty' (alias bin/jetty.sh) and not use directly the command line.

Basically adding to start.ini the 'etc/jetty-setuid.xml' is not enough.

You must add '--pre=etc/jetty-setuid.xml' to start.ini .
Alternatively you can add '--pre=etc/jetty-setuid.xml' to $JETTY_ARGS in /etc/default/jetty .
Another option is to add in etc/jetty.conf the line '--pre=etc/jetty-setuid.xml' before '--pre=etc/jetty-logging.xml' .

In this way the the Object with id 'Server' is created as an instance of org.mortbay.setuid.SetUIDServer before etc/jetty-logging.xml could instantiate it as an instance of org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server.

I think this should be document.

Created an attachment (id=84315)
proposed patch

The problem occur when editing composite cheat sheet that contains dependsOn elements. The PDE handles correctly only the old definition dependency.

example:
There is a composite Cheat Sheet file that contains both the new dependsOn and the old dependency elements (the latter has no effect in Cheat Sheet visualization).
If the file is open in the composite cheat sheet editor after modifying it and saving it the dependsOn is removed. Indeed opening again the file with text editor we see that all the dependsOn elements were removed while the dependency elements remained untouched.

In attachment I added a patch that tries to fix this misbehaviour.

278259 - Can't create a new server if rename an existing one
282909 - Can't create a new server if rename an existing one

Steps are the same except I don't like the new behavior either ) 

Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create a server using the default name
2.Rename the server in the server editor
3.Create a new server by launching the new server wizard

The new server is not created.  The user is told he cannot create this server because its name is in use. However when looking in the servers view there is no server visible with the name in question. This is confusing to users. 

I'll be submitting a patch but I'm sure you'll find parts of it that are not clean or efficient enough so I encourage you to help me make it more suitable ) 


My patch will allow you to re-use a server name by generating a unique 'id' in the case that a name is not in use but the id is in use. Since having a situation where id != name is already supported (ie create a server and rename it now it has different name and id) I do not feel generating a unique id is so terrible of a solution for this edge-case.",50,"0"

WebAppContext's ServletContext is not able to resolve aliased resources. This is important to have when you run embedded Jetty with JSF 2 (Mojarra). Mojarra is dependent of ServletContext while performs scanning and expects servletContext.getResource() to return classes correctly (com.sun.faces.config.JavaClassScanningAnnotationScanner.containsAnnotation if needed for deeper testing).

Below is the test case for a simple Maven project with one file (JettyLauncher):
-----------
import org.eclipse.jetty.util.resource.ResourceCollection

public class JettyLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

The standard behavior for Maven is to use target/generated-sources/xxxx for generated source files.

IntelliJ IDEA and (I believe) Netbeans automatically detect these directories as source directories and use them for auto-completion and static analysis of the rest of a project.

As it's often frowned upon to generate source code into version control managed directories and it improves integration with non-eclipse development tools it would be good to change the default configuration to use the following output directories:

"SAPPHIRE-397045","FailSafeFunction has a problem with malformed property values","FailSafeFunction implementation applies the default value before performing the cast. This can lead to problems in certain situations as it can be difficult to determine prior to the cast whether the value is null. The answer can depend on which type is expected.

The current check is as follows:

if( val == null || ( val instanceof Value && ( (Value) val ).getContent() == null ) )

The issue is with val.getContent() which for a typed value property will return null when property has a value but that value is malformed. 

The fix is to perform the cast prior to applying the default value. This avoids dealing with the question of whether we should be referencing the typed content or untyped text. The cast logic takes care of that.",13,"0"

1. start fresh workspace
2. set target to I20060105-0800

Workaround:
1. create a project
2. add I20060105-0800/configuration/config.ini to that project
3. in the launch config choose above config.ini
==> launching works

I think it is quite common that people want to develop 3.2 code or providing a patch using a release build i.e. 3.1.x. What about using the config.ini from the target per default or at least having an additional radio button:

"PAPYRUS-444971","[Sequence Diagram] Resizing of Lifelines should be fully-automatic","Build id: I20140606-1215

OML UML spec (17.3.4 Notation):
A Lifeline is shown using a symbol that consists of a rectangle forming its “head” followed by a vertical line (which may be dashed) that represents the lifetime of the participant.

Adding the support for DestructionOccurrenceSpecification (444956) will allow explicit specification of the lifetime's ending. Accordingly a lifeline that doesn't end with X symbol should be treated as a lifeline which corresponding lifetime's ending is out of scope of the diagram. 

All lifelines that doesn't end with an X symbol should be visually prolonged till the bottom of the diagram. Otherwise any node below the graphical lowest point of a lifeline symbol (e.g. on another lifelime) could be erroneously considered as taking place at a later point in time than the lifeline's corresponding lifetime's ending.

It should be disallowed to resize such live lifelines by hand in GUI. The resizing should be performed as a part of resizing of the outer Interaction. All newly created lifelines should be visually ending near the bottom of the diagram.",761,"1"

The problem with IJavaScriptProject#findType is that it returns the first type to match the given FQN but that type may not actully be the one a caller is looking for.  Then if the caller asks for a field they are expecting on the type but its the wrong type a org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.internal.core.JavaElement.newNotPresentException is thrown.

"Z_ARCHIVED-45470","PDSecurity causes javacore","This defect occured when the WSDK were doing their testing on Linux (SuSE 8.1) 
machine details are 1.8GHz with 2GB RAM.  We saw more than one occurence of 
this problem
although we were unable to consistently recreate it.  The javacore when it did 
happen was always during the shutdown of Eclipse.

This isn't going to be easy to describe but please bear with me!

I'll forward the javacore dump to Jeff Turnham for completeness the file is 
called javacore1921.1063369006.txt (I'll refer to line numbers in this file to 
try to make things easier.)

Line 752 shows PDSecurityPlugin.shutdown method being called which in turn 
(from the code) calls PDSecurityImages.shutdown() method.

PDSecurityImages.shutdown() initially checks to see if _images has been 
initialised and if not returns immediately.  The implementation of this class 
appears to be the source of
the problem.  In order for this method to do anything the class must be 
instantiated.  During the initialisation of the class (lines 45 and 46) two 
final static ImageDescriptors are
instantiated each making a call to createManaged(String String).  Inside 
createManaged method you will see that _images gets initialised with a new 
HashMap() if it is null.

Therefore _image can 'never' be null during shutdown().

The createManaged(String String) method also initialises an ImageDescriptor 
from a URL.  You will see all this from the javacore round lines 751 back up to 
745 where it looks like
the code is trying to get hold of a graphic device which by now probably 
doesn't exist (Eclipse is shutting down).

I hope this makes sense I guess you'll need to get back to me if it doesn't.

Hi Valentina...is this CMVC component still valid?
If so can you take a look at this defect?  Andy sent 
me the javacore file and I've pasted the stack below.
It appears that an during the creation of an Image 
the JVM is crashing (perhaps due to an image already
being disposed?)

Thanks...

Stack state when deadlocked.

Pretty much on one every two launch I get a deadlock during the Model resolving phase (I'm using Compare with Each other in the workspace and no team support). My models are .uml and .aird files I'm launching the comparison on each .aird file wich references its own .uml file.

Things which might be relevant or not :

the .uml file versions are referencing the same profile definition which is in the plugins.
the .aird file versions are referencing the same viewpoint definition which is in the plugins too.

The deadlock doesn't seem related to extension registry population as sometimes I am able to do a full comparison trigger the same comparison again and ends up blocked.

Hitting pause on debug I get the attached stack trace.

Most of the ModelResolver threads are suspended in Unsafe.park(boolean long) line: not available [native method]	(I did not expand all of them)

1. Start WAS in Debug mode from RAD                                     
                                                                        
                                                                        
2. Develop a Dynamic Web project v 2.5 targeting WAS 7                  
                                                                        
3. Add a Servlet with a sysout in doGet                                 
                                                                        
4. Add the project to WAS                                               
                                                                        
5. Add a breakpoint inside doGet                                        
                                                                        
6. Debug the servlet so that it reaches the breakpoint                  
                                                                        
7. Click on the bug button in the debug view to restart the server in 
debug mode                                                              
                                                                        
7. while the server is restarting add a new space char inside the doGet
method of the servlet.                                                  
                                                                        
If you do this while the server is still shutting down then you can    
save the servlet.                                                       
                                                                        
If you wait until when the server has initiated the restart then you   
cannot save the servlet.                                                
                                                                        
You see a progress dialog with three entries:                           
                                                                        
- Restarting WAS 7.0 server                                             
- Save                                                                  
- Starting WAS 7.0 server                                               
                                                                        
8. If you wait for some time (minutes) then you will get a dialog asking
if you want to save. Click OK                                           
                                                                        
9. Now RAD is still hanging and you see in the progress dialog:        
                                                                        
Save                                                                    
Starting WAS                                                            
Building prerequisite project list                                      
                                                                        
However the server appears to be in started state.

"TYCHO-332342","problems downloading from p2 repositories","Since Wednesday the egit build on hudson.eclipse.org all of a sudden suffers from download problems when accessing p2 repositories.

Since that time we are unable to build egit against the galileo p2 repository when running the build in hudson on hudson.eclipse.org due to download failures when Tycho tries to fetch artifacts.

When running the same Maven 3/Tycho based build locally using the same p2 repositories and starting from an empty local Maven repository these local builds succeed.

We also observe frequent download failures [1] when the egit build tries to download from the jgit p2 repository via http [2] which typically has been built few minutes before since these two build jobs are chained in Hudson. Usually re-running the egit build fixes this problem.

On Hudson we switched p2 mirrors off since we earlier faced problems when p2 decided to pick mirrors on the other end of the planet.

Currently we switched off the galileo builds and only run builds against helios.

List of p2 repositories the egit build uses:

build against galileo:
http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/7.1.6.v20100715/repository/
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo
http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/galileo/dev-build/update-site

Doug can you upload a Gerrit reivew for CDT? See Bug 433475 for an example.

The following values are based on the https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme from Andrea who donate the theme to Eclipse maybe you can use them?

IBM contributes translations for the Eclipse Project and several top-level projects in every major release of Eclipse. However there are no official information on what are available where to get them how to install them and how to use them. This article provides step-by-step instructions on what are available where to download them how to install them and how to launch Eclipse in different languages. Examples on launching Eclipse in different languages including single byte language like French double byte language like Traditional Chinese and bi-directional language like Arabic on different operating systems like RHEL WS 4 Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.3 Panther together with useful hints and tips will give you a good general idea on how to launch Eclipse in any of the translated languages even if the environment you want to work on is not explicitly discussed.

This is due to a test case issue with the CASCADE_BARTENDER and CASCADE_AWARD tables having compound pks (ID and F_NAME ID and DESCRIPTION respectively) where only the ID field was used as a pk in the TopLink projects.  In the failing tests the non ID field was being modified.  TimesTen shares EclipseLink's restriction that primary key fields cannot be modified which resulted in the above exception.

Also need to change the testing\models\legacy\Computer.java class to use the timestamp pk workaround when the TimesTen platform is used - The tests are running into duplicate pk exceptions using System.currentTimeMillis() to generate the pk due to precision",0,"0"

"PAPYRUS-428891","[Table 2] Error marker resulting from copy/paste of wrong values not removed when entering valid value afterwards","Created attachment 240256
Patch to remove error marker when valid value is entered in a cell.

If one copy/paste rows from Excel into a Papyrus table
the paste operation will create error markers for any cell with an incorrect value (which is fine).
However entering a valid value afterwards manually does *not* remove the error marker (even though the new valid value is actually taken into account).
Note that entering a new valid value for a boolean cell is a bit tricky
as the checkbox is actually hidden by the error marker and only the SPACE toggling shortcut can be used to do it (but it works).

Any time a valid value is entered the tool shall check whether there was an error marker in the cell previously and if so remove it.

The attached patch fixes the pb (although for boolean cell you still have to know the toggling shortcut to resolve the issue).
The code is inspired from code by Vincent Lorenzo.",16,"0"

"NEBULA-351699","Nebula Grid loads slowly when we create more columns (more than 200) in Ubuntu Linux","Build Identifier: Eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32

Hi 

I am creating more than 200 columns in nebula grid using for loop. It is
working fine in windows platform but when the same source is run on ubuntu
linux it takes lot of time to load. In Ubuntu it takes more than 10 secs and in
windows it takes only 2-3 seconds. 

The code is as follows :

for (int i = 0 i < 200  i++)
{
GridColumn column = new GridColumn(bottomGridDayViewSWT.NONE)
if(i==0)
{
column.setWidth(20)
}
else if(i==1)
{
column.setWidth(30)
}
else if(i == delimitCol)
{
column.setWidth(5)
}
else
{
column.setWidth(3)
}
}

We are creating around 200 columns on the grid (bottomGridDayView). The grid is formed by the code below.


bottomGridDayView = new Grid(canvasSWT.NONE | SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.H_SCROLL)

bottomGridDayView.setHeaderVisible(false)
bottomGridDayView.setRowHeaderVisible(false)
bottomGridDayView.setCellSelectionEnabled(true)


On Windows XP :- Above code loads the grid in 2-3 seconds
On Suse Linux :- Above code loads the grid in 2-3 seconds
On Ubuntu Linux :- Above code loads the grid in more than 7 seconds

We are facing this problem only on Ubuntu linux operating system.

Please help us to solve the issue.

Full comparator messages are below but they basically say the xml_ui and xml_sdk features have exact same version numbers in M2 and this weeks's I-build but different contents. That of course is a big no-no and we need to focus on not delivering (even declaring) builds that have this violation. If people install based on features they won't update their xml_ui one even though there is new contents. This general issue is caused by bug 208143 and is further described in bug 322601. Essentially the theory goes a small change in a bundle's version get's lost (truncated) in the feature's suffix. Hence simply retagging the features to today's date will make them distinct from M2 versions. Once we confirm the releng test is valid ... and the contents really have changed from M2 :) Unfortunately there's no easy way to tell (from these results) which bundle inside the feature changed since M2 ... but hopefully SSE team will know right off if any changed thus confirming the releng test. 

I've marked as blocker simply because technically we shouldn't let such an identical-but-changed feature out into the wild ... and we should respin to pick up a fix.

However the basic Juno support on parameters is useful but limited final fields assigned a @NonNull value lose the annotation.

This is fixed in http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_Core/Null_Analysis/Beta#Syntactic_analysis making the facility much more useful just have to cast/test a tractable number of incoming Java/EMF values.

To support this it is just necessary to install from the http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/beta-null-annotations-for-fields update. So to make this work on Hudson we presumably just  need to ensure that the org.eclipse.jdt.annotation search path resolves there. Is it that easy?",204,"1"

We should quickly push a workaround to avoid the NPE but the real fix is related to bug 430676: the AirdResourc and AirdResourceFactory should be moved back into the core plug-ins not in the diagram (or worse diagram.ui) layers.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. generate a parse log 
2. open the parse log
3. notice that the active build configuration is not mentioned 


More information:
I'm a long-time C/C++ coder but new to Eclipse as of the Ganymede release.  Today I couldn't figure out why my header files were not being found by the parser.  I was making the parser log and seeing the -I option with no directories associated after I very carefully added the required directories to the active build configuration.  

Turns out that the default for the indexer is to use the same build all the time which was not the build I was messing around with and there was nothing in the parser log file to warn me about this.  Eventually I humbled myself to RTFM on the indexer discovered that the indexer has its own configuration tab and that the associated build can be set there.  

If the default behaviour is to *not* track the active build there is no excuse to leave out the active build in the preamble to the parser log.  

This is what my parser output looked like: 

Project:       loopback
Index Version: 3997696
File:          file:/C:/eclipse/loopback/main.c 
Context:       file:/Z:/eclipse/loopback/main.c
Language:      GNU C

Include Search Path (option -I):

...

Notice the empty search path when I had carefully set this up in the active build.  

What it should look like:

"WTP_WEBSERVICES-238456","Separate env functionality from Ant functionality","Build ID: 3.0.0

Steps To Reproduce:

The plug-in org.eclipse.wst.command.env currently contains a dependency to the Apache Ant plugin provided by Eclipse (i.e. org.apache.ant and org.eclipse.ant.core are a Require-Bundle's in org.eclipse.wst.command.env MANIFEST.MF file).  This is normally fine but we have a headless Eclipse+WTP based application that relies on the webservice functionality but it does not need the Ant task and Apache Ant dependencies.  Therefore I would like to ask to have the org.eclipse.wst.command.env functionality to be separated from the Ant task functionality.  This should be relatively simple as it should only involve taking out the Ant task class (WebServiceGenerationAntTask) defined in this plug-in and putting it in a new plug-in (maybe org.eclipse.wst.command.env.ant) and then have this new plug-in depend on org.eclipse.wst.command.env and the Apache Ant plug-ins provided by Eclipse.  Then you can remove the Apache Ant plug-in dependencies from org.eclipse.wst.command.env (org.apache.ant and org.eclipse.ant.core) which would cause our build to no longer import the Apache Ant plug-in into our product.

"BIRT-233755","dynamic pagebreak issue","Created attachment 101804
Zip containing a report and pdf doc and ppt outputs from different birt version

Using the pagebreak properties set to auto is resulting in strange behaviour.

I will add a zip containing an exapmple report as well as pdf doc and ppt files created with birt 2.2.1.1. 2.2.2 and 2.3.0 designer and webviewer.

Please note that i have set the pagebreak intervall to 99 on purpose. For my reports do not have the same number of textlines per detail and therefor setting the page break intervall isn't helping.

Please note also that I was actualy trying to reset the page number to 1 after each group which is how I discovered the bug. It is done by a script in the onPageBreak method of the table that Jason Weathersby proposed in the newsgroup.

I tried everything with BIRT Version 2.2.1.1 2.2.2 and 2.3.0.

Behaviour in 2.2.1.1:
PageBreaks occur as expected Masterpages are used correctly PageNumbers are nut numbered correctly and show null on the end.

Behaviour in 2.2.2:
PDF Output is resized when it doesn't fit the page. Doc and PPT not numbered correctly.

Behaviour in 2.3.0:
PageBreaks occur as expected Masterpage content and margins are ignored for some pages in PDF. Numbers are not correct.

After testing around quite a lot and even logging the on pageBreak script I come to the conclusion that before rendering the report to a specified format. There are the pagebreaks that occur because of the groups pagebreak after property. For each of these pagebreak the onpagebreak script is called.

Further Pagebreaks added by PDF DOC or PPT to fit pagesizes are done later and do nnot trigger the on page break script. These also lead to some funny rendering in all formats. Please look at the last pages of the samples provided.

So to summarize: I expected pagebreaks to work as in the 2.2.1.1. pdf output. PageNumber Script isn't working there but the rest is fine. In later Versions PDF as wel as PPT and Doc output become strange.

Hope this can be fixed.

Why is my system unknown? I am running Mac OS X which Oomph should be able to detect -- if that is indeed what is meant by system.

"Z_ARCHIVED-257981","SPI: DeploymentDescriptor.setResources() fails to clear Topology before adding Resources list","The setResources() method in DeploymentDescriptorImpl fails to clear the existing Topology element before adding the new list of Resources. This results in the method behaving as an add resources method instead of set resources.

For example:
If Topology contains Resources 1 and 2 and setResources(Resource 3) is called Topology would then contain Resources 1 2 and 3. The correct behavior would be for Topology to only contain Resource 3 after the setResources() call.",0,"0"

Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found. Software currently installed: Shared profile 1.0.0.1323208539966 (SharedProfile_epp.package.java 1.0.0.1323208539966) Missing requirement: Shared profile 1.0.0.1323208539966 (SharedProfile_epp.package.java 1.0.0.1323208539966) requires 'org.maven.ide.eclipse [1.0.100.20110804-1717]' but it could not be found

As far as I know the current package building mechanism involves a feature  (for instance epp.modeling) including the other features. Problem arise when somebody want's to install a newer version of one of the included feature p2 then would have to un-install the whole epp feature If I'm not mistaken.

On the other hand I had pretty good experiences lately with Tycho exporting 'Eclipse IDE like' product with .product files. In this case the .product holds all the feature references to include.",737,"1"

Build Identifier: 20090619-0625

I try to register a Check validation file for validating EMF models.

However using the extension point org.eclipse.xtend.typesystem.emf.checks seems not to work as it does not register anything. Debugging an instance shows that the EValidator.Registry afterwards is still empty.

Additionally confusing is the extension point description. It says:
To enable this extension point make sure the plug-in is loaded e.g. by calling Activator.getDefault() explicitly. Otherwise the extensions will not be parsed and no EValidator will be registered.

Unfortunately the plugin does not have an activator so this hint is pretty useless.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I set org.eclipse.xtend.typesystem.emf as dependency and set extension point org.eclipse.xtend.typesystem.emf.checks like

<extension
         point=org.eclipse.xtend.typesystem.emf.checks>
      <metaModel

                MyPackage.eINSTANCE model/MyChecks.chk false new ArrayList())

Here are some suggestions for improvements:
1. Some parameters are within square brackets while others in angle brackets.  It's not obvious the difference of the two annotations. I suggest to make them consistent.  Indicate optional values explicitly.
2. set soapversion [11 or 12]
The two SOAP versions are 1.1 and 1.2.  I think it's better to include the decimal point.  The SOAP version is specific to the data manager.  Should it be a parameter graphQuery command?  
3. I suppose username and password are for doing the graphQuery only.  Can they be passed in as parameters to the graphQuery command?  I also assume the username and password pair is specific to the data manager.  So it's not a global value.  When looking at the command list the user may be know what username and password does he need to set.  
4. The command Show is not self-explanatory.  Please consider settings or words of similar meaning.  Also note the capitalization. 
5. I think we can remove the work broker from all commands that begin with this word.  I don't see any ambiguity without this word. 
6. broker epr print and broker epr change:  There 2 commands are inconsistent in that they have the noun before the verb and the words are separated by a space. If you accept the change in #5 you can consider changing these two commands to printBrokerEpr and changeBrokerEpr.
7. broker registerServiceGroup    [wsdl URL #2] ...
8. grouping the commands.  I see three types of commands:

Files with modified code to allow correct tree display

At the end of the mindmap tutorial a screenshot shows an elements tree under the diagram file name in the project explorer.

This diagram elements tree is not displayed in my editor.

After some more investigation it appears that the GMF templates for code generation sensibly changed since the mindmap tutorial...

The element tree under the diagram file name is not displayed because one generated line has been removed from xxNavigatorContentProvider#getChildren just before the return result.toArray() statement :

result.addAll(createNavigatorItems(selectViewsByType(topViews xxEditPart.MODEL_ID) file false))

This causes the method to return an empty array.

When corrected another problem appears. The root element name as well as the links names are left empty in the project explorer tree.

This is due to the corresponding getxxText() methods in xxNavigatorLabelProvider that systematically return an empty string.
This also differs from the former generated code in the mindmap example.

Providing the root element name and the links names solves this unnamed tree nodes problem as well.",13,"0"

"PTP-255839","new remote editor","Created attachment 118285
proposed patch

The current implementation of the remote editor in RDT is basically just a copy-pasted version of the CDT editor. This creates problems because in CDT there is lots of code that depends on the concrete type of the editor. This has led to a snowball effect where more and more code has been copy-pasted from CDT in order to get things to work. 

The only real difference with the remote editor is that some of the action groups are replaced with remote versions. For example the action that opens the Type Hierarchy is replaced with an action that opens the Remote Type Hierarchy instead.

I have discovered that by making a few small changes to the CEditor class from CDT (bug 255688) its possible to extend from CEditor then override the actions with the remote versions. This means that copying all that code is unnecessary.

This approach has another huge benefit. I was able to add code that checks if the file is from a remote project before overriding the actions. So the remote editor defaults back to normal local behaviour when opened on local files. This fixes bug 249156.

Also scalability mode was added to CEditor after it was copied into RDT. By extending the existing CEditor scalability mode now works in RDT.",1,"0"

This version check has a few problems:

* it treats the reference to the definition as a list value whereas in fact the
  UML API only maintains and looks for a single reference.  The annotation reference
  feature just happens to be list-valued.  If by some happenstance a second or more
  references end up in this list they should all be ignored because UML ignores them
  anyways
* it requires the profile application to exist in the origin in a three-way comparison.
  This is too restrictive:  if the left and right both apply the same version of the
  same profile then this should just be an add-add pseudo conflict.  There should be
  no real problem with the comparison because both sides can only add applications of
  stereotypes from this profile.  These also should usually be add-add pseudo conflicts
  (an element may only apply any stereotype once) or at worst real conflicts if
  details of the stereotype applications conflict

It may seem too restrictive that this check requires the profile definition annotation to be present or absent on both sides (in addition to being the same version when it is present on both sides).  The idea being that if it is absent on one side then the profile is either applied or unapplied from the left-side perspective.  However that scenario is handled without even getting into this check because in that case not only is the annotation not present on one side but neither is the containing profile application.  So this check actually detects a case where one side uses a dynamic profile definition and the other side a static profile definition which is manifestly an incompatibility in the same vein as two different dynamic definitions.",150,"1"

"EQUINOX-61266","Hello World plug-in class constructor not called on plug-in activation","Build id: 200405060200

BACKGROUND:
I am converting my old 2.1 plug-ins to eliminate the deprecations related to 
the compatibility layer it appears the semantics of plug-in class activation 
has changed... or there's a bug.

TO REPRODUCE:
I generated the venerable Hello Eclipse.  I checked the Create an OSGi 
manifest option and accepted all the other defaults.  I wanted to see if 
initialization worked as expected so I added:

    HelloworldPlugin.getDefault()

to the SampleAction.run method.  It returns null i.e. a action within the 
plug-in is instantiated but its associated plug-in class is not (?).  I 
regen'd without checking Create an OSGi manifest and it worked as expected.

Just to be clear what started my investigation was eliminating the 
deprecation warnings.  I want to do the LEAST possible to reach that goal 
i.e. OSGi explotaition isn't an issue.  My gen of HelloWorld didn't have the 
compatibility layer in the plugin.xml (good) but the generated methods of the 
plug-in class like getDefault() didn't work either (bad).",1,"0"

This method uses getDocument() for each leg which in the case of
an IStreamContentAccessor input asks the DocumentManager for a
cached working copy.  For the old input this is fine since the
DocumentManager still contains the old working copy.  For the new
input however this usually returns 'null' because no copy has
yet been cached.

So in this case sameDoc() will always return 'true' for each leg!
Hence the user will never be prompted to save changes and sometimes
they will be lost.

This is a serious issue for VCM because many of its components are
built around IStreamContentAccessors and exhibit the problem.",23,"0"

When I open https://oss.sonatype.org in my web browser the certificate I get does indeed contain *.sonatype.org as subjectAltName and common name so I suspect a caching problem somwhere between our HIPP instance and the repository.

The dialog is about jp2launcher.exe. I searched for that process and it seems to be related to Applets and web start. We don't use those things so maybe tests from another project triggered this.

I don't know if the dialog can just be closed (canceled) or if it will just come up again.",1,"0"
"PDE-184041","Changing target environment does not update the plugin container","I20070418-1012
I have noticed that when I change my target environment the plug-in dependencies do not get updated which can cause problems. 
Here are steps to reproduce:
- start eclipse
- create a plug-in with some UI dependencies
- expand the plug-in dependencies and notice that the swt fragment for your platform is present. good.
- change the target platform to point at an RCP based target containing the delta pack. reload. apply. the plug-in dependencies are left unchanged. good.
- now modify the environment variables in the target platform to something else notice that the reference to the swt fragment is not modified properly.",17,"0"

"PLATFORM-4566","table cell owner draw (1G2W3ET)","============================== Question ============================== 

from Cheng-Yee Lin 09/08/00


com.ibm.swt.widgets.Table and associated documentation needs to be
more complete. 

It should describe how to create a table with multiple
columns and how to use cell renderers etc. 

An up to date Table example with multiple columns would be most helpful.


NOTES:


The SWT control example has a multi column table. There is no owner
draw support in the current version of the SWT table.


 (10/15/00 9:18:03 PM)
Q.		Is there anything in plan to add support?

*	I have also asked client what exactly they intend to use it for.

McQ (16/10/2000 11:54:23 AM) -
		We have done some investigation of the platforms' limited owner draw
		support and found it to be problematic. There are many higher priority
		issues than this and so we are unlikely to make much headway on it this
		cycle. (In plan the item is labeled as [No commitment.]).

		I will however make sure that there is a good example of multi-column
		table creation provided with the next drop.


GDA (10/16/00 10:27:32 PM)
	Email from mcq also indicated the related plan item is
	Owner Draw - SWT already provides the ability to create 
	application-drawn emulated widgets. We will be extending and refining 
	that ability this development cycle. What this line item is asking for is 
	somewhat different: The ability for application code to participate in 
	the painting of the existing platform widgets by being called at 
	appropriate times during the widget's repaint operation. Platform limitations 
	make this difficult to implement consistently everywhere. We will 
	investigate this but are unlikely to make much progress on it. [No commitment.]

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a dependency on the rich text plugin org.eclipse.epf.richtext
2. Deploy the workspace.

Non-exists svg image isn't processed as the normal image.

Build number:2.2.0.v20061216

Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy a svg image to resource folder.
2. New a report insert an image and select the svg file set alt-text as not found.
3. Delete the svg file and preview the report in IE and Firefox.

Expected result:
Because the svg image doesn't exist so alt-text should display

Actual result:
In IE I saw a gray background right click will see svg context menu.
In Firefox I saw error message as:org.eclipse.birt.report.service.api.ReportServiceException: Missing image file.

When the  element is missing from the component XML document an error is reported by the editor. But when you use the form-based editor to set the Class: field the  element is NOT added to the XML.

The net result is that the Class: field is effectively disconnected from the XML document while there is no  element. This is unfortunate since it requires the user to know to add the missing element by hand.  The form-based editor should relieve the user from such details.

Looking at the form-based editor the Class: field appears to be an attribute of the Component which is fine but it does mean that the editor must fill in the gaps for the user and add the missing  element to the XML.",8,"0"

The code for isEnabled() for these two occurrences of ManageProvidedInterfacesHandler is incorrect and can lead to ClassCastExceptions.

"PLATFORM-70854","Regression: GridLayout misapplies horizontalSpacing when makeColumnsEqualWidth == true","In the testcase below the expected result is a shell containing
two 75px wide buttons that are separated by a 100px wide space.

The actual result however is that each button is 175px wide.
It turns out that when the makeColumnsEqualWidth property of
GridLayout is set to true (see constructor) GridLayout apparently
adds the value of the horizontalSpacing field (which is only meant
to specify the space _between_ cells) to each cell.

This is a regression which must have been introduced between
3.0M6 (3034) and 3.0M7 (3038). 3.0 (3062) still has this problem.

(This bug actually affects a lot of dialog buttons in Eclipse itself
making them 81px wide instead of 76px when the default Windows
font settings are used.)

"RAP-216422","[Events] Listening to SWT.Activate event does not invoke handleEvent","I made good progress on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=213988 (it's running now woo hoo) but I'm having trouble getting activate events when I do the following for my viewer panes:

    control.addListener(SWT.Activate this)

It seems that when the listener is registered it goes into

      public void addListener( final Widget widget
                               final int eventType
                               final Listener listener )
      {
        addListener( eventType listener )
        switch( eventType ) {
    //...
          break
          case SWT.Activate:
          case SWT.Deactivate:
          case SWT.Close:
            *ShellEvent*.addListener( widget this )

So it treats it as a shell event:

    public final class *ShellEvent *extends TypedEvent {

      public static final int SHELL_CLOSED = SWT.Close
      public static final int SHELL_ACTIVATED = SWT.Activate
      public static final int SHELL_DEACTIVATED = SWT.Deactivate

But in Shell.setActiveControl it uses *ActivateEvent *instead:

      void setActiveControl( final Control activateControl ) {
        Control control = activateControl
        if( control != null && control.isDisposed() ) {
          control = null
        }
        if( lastActive != null && lastActive.isDisposed() ) {
          lastActive = null
        }
        if( lastActive != control ) {
          // Compute the list of controls to be activated and
    deactivated by finding
          // the first common parent control.
          Control[] activate
            = ( control == null ) ? new Control[ 0 ] : control.getPath()
          Control[] deactivate
            = lastActive == null ? new Control[ 0 ] : lastActive.getPath()
          lastActive = control
                   int index = 0
          int length = Math.min( activate.length deactivate.length )
          while( index < length && activate[ index ] == deactivate[
    index ] ) {
            index++
          }
          // It is possible (but unlikely) that application code could have
          // destroyed some of the widgets. If this happens keep
    processing those
          // widgets that are not disposed.
          ActivateEvent evt
          for( int i = deactivate.length - 1 i >= index --i ) {
            if( !deactivate[ i ].isDisposed() ) {
              evt = new *ActivateEvent*( deactivate[ i ]
    ActivateEvent.DEACTIVATED )
              evt.processEvent()
            }
          }
          for( int i = activate.length - 1 i >= index --i ) {
            if( !activate[ i ].isDisposed() ) {
              evt = new *ActivateEvent*( activate[ i ]
    ActivateEvent.ACTIVATED )
              evt.processEvent()
            }
          }
        }
      }

The activate event applies for the same constants:

    public final class ActivateEvent extends TypedEvent {

      public static final int ACTIVATED = *SWT.Activate*
      public static final int DEACTIVATED = *SWT.Deactivate*

I know in a regular workbench I get my activate events from the above Shell method so I think something is wrong.  I tried changing the code to use ShellEvent and that made my EMF stuff work properly but it makes the rest of the workbench misbehave.  The following seems to give the best results for me:

          ActivateEvent evt
    *      ShellEvent sevt*
          for( int i = deactivate.length - 1 i >= index --i ) {
            if( !deactivate[ i ].isDisposed() ) {
              evt = new ActivateEvent( deactivate[ i ]
    ActivateEvent.DEACTIVATED )
              evt.processEvent()
    *          sevt = new ShellEvent( deactivate[ i ]
    ShellEvent.SHELL_DEACTIVATED )
              sevt.processEvent()*
            }
          }
          for( int i = activate.length - 1 i >= index --i ) {
            if( !activate[ i ].isDisposed() ) {
              evt = new ActivateEvent( activate[ i ]
    ActivateEvent.ACTIVATED )
              evt.processEvent()
    *          sevt = new ShellEvent( activate[ i ]
    ShellEvent.SHELL_ACTIVATED )
              sevt.processEvent()*

paths to be found like the following:
<pathelement

This only works on other machines if Eclipse is installed in the same directory
structure as on the generating machine let alone Eclipse on other platforms
(e.g. Mac). This is a problem mostly for custom = true in the
build.properties when one starts off with a generated build.xml. It would be
good if the Eclipse install directory could be configured in the build.properties.

I'm using a custom build.xml anyway only because I need some
bytecode-enhancement in the build process which is common at least with JDO
based applications. I'm not very ant-savvy but wouldn't it somehow be possible
to configure a bytecode-enhancing task incl. classpath to be invoked between

unnecessary.

At a minimum there should be some text suggesting to look in the log for more information.  I mean I have been using Eclipse for a while and I forget that this stuff is in the log.  Think about the person who is not as experienced.

"PLATFORM-27063","[features] legal issues for features","The feature model is changing to support multiple configurations within one 
feature definition.  Currently the eclipse's features are platform-specific so 
there is a natural home for legal documents (about.html ...) which may be 
platform specific.  In particular the license text is generic and occurs in 
both the feature.properites and license.html files.  The license itself is not 
translated.

The platform specific info is in the about.html and about.properties (both 
found in the feature plugin).  

Under the proposed changes these files will move to a consolidated feature. 
There they will be arranged according to the standard eclipse os/ws/arch dir 
structure.  

Note that in NL features this will be crossed with the standard Java locale 
search stucture such that the NL searching occurs below the eclipse os/ws/arch 
dir structure.

This approach allows for any number of platform specific files to be managed in 
a common structure.  The drawback is that the feature will contain information 
about all supported platforms.  The space taken is minimal as the only 
variations are in the about.* files which are small.  The information must be 
clearly marked with its target platform however so that a casual reader not 
using eclipse (e.g. using windows explorer) will be able to understand to 
which platform the information is relevant.",72,"0"

Git repo showcasing the wrong deletion of files

When doing a merge containing a REAL conflict with the pre-merge setting on data loss can occur. 

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a model with a class 'ClassA' (branch master).
- Create a new branch from master that renames this class to 'ClassB' (branch left).
- Create a new branch from master that renames this class to 'ClassC' and adds ClassC in the diagram of another newly added model. Therefore the newly added model is also part of the logical model. (branch right).

When performing the merge from left to right the rename conflict is detected correctly and the pre-merge adds the newly added model from the other branch as expected.

However when performing the merge from the right to left the rename conflict is detected correctly but the newly added model is deleted.

I have attached a git repo that showcases this behavior. The problem only occurs when a REAL conflict is detected otherwise the pre-merge works as expected.",89,"0"

Build Identifier: 

This was originally fixed in defect 131958. Since then the WAI-ARIA specification changed such that it no longer uses namespaces. Consequently ARIA semantics are not recognized not mapped to accessibility APIs and not spoken by screen readers.

What I believe the change is that needs to be made is:

So the namespaces go. role attributes and their values are no longer namespaced. ARIA states and properties become aria- followed by the value.

x2:role=wairole:tree 

becomes

role=tree

and

waistate:expanded=true

becomes aria-expanded=true

so 

where you have 

That would change this snippet:


<div x2:role=wairole:tree tabindex=-1 class=tree
onclick=return treeItemClick(event)
ondblclick=return treeItemEvent(event)
onkeydown=return treeItemEvent(event)
onkeypress=return treeItemEvent(event) id=tree>
<img src=minus.gif tabindex=-1
x2:role=wairole:presentation onclick=imgToggle(event) alt=><span
tabindex=0 x2:role=wairole:treeitem waistate:expanded=true

To:

<div role=tree tabindex=-1 class=tree
onclick=return treeItemClick(event)
ondblclick=return treeItemEvent(event)
onkeydown=return treeItemEvent(event)
onkeypress=return treeItemEvent(event) id=tree>
<img src=minus.gif tabindex=-1
role=presentation onclick=imgToggle(event) alt=><span
tabindex=0 role=treeitem aria-expanded=true

Here are some examples:

http://test.cita.illinois.edu/aria/tree/tree1.php
http://codetalks.org/source/widgets/tree/tree.html

It is important that we keep the structure (tree treeitem groups etc.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply bring up eclipse help
2. Start the JAWS screen reader
3. navigate to the navigation panel (tree widget) and navigate it with the keyboard.
4. You will not be able to use the arrow keys to navigate the navigate the navigation tree folders on the left hand side of the help screen and JAWS will not read them. If you tab between tree items JAWS will call them links
4. If it is fixed JAWS will not steal the keyboard keys used to open and close folders and you will hear the tree items or folders and their expanded/collapsed state as well as folder depth information along with the number of elements at that level.

Currently the services using the CommandCache usually clear their cache when the target suspends and sometimes resumes.  However since shared data can change at any time if at least one thread is running it puts the CommandCache concept in question.

For instance the ExpressionService caches MetaCommands that fetch variables' values.  This cache is assumed to be valid until a Resumed event is received.  In non-stop that cache is not safe.  Furhtermore variable objects that represent global variables can never be assumed to be up-to-date in non-stop.
Also the memory cache has to be revisited since memory can also change at any time.

Another issue is automatic refresh of the views.  Currently we took care to have each view refresh its data if something was changed by another service.  However in non-stop mode other threads can cause those changes at an unmanageable rate and unknown to DSF.

I've run some tests with the JDT which must also deal with this issue and I have found that data is not refreshed automatically.  Instead the user must trigger some refreshing action like selecting the data.

The model structure is a simple parent child containment where the child objects have a non-containment reference to an object in another model.

Model A (a.ecore)
  EClass Parent
    EReference children (type = Child containment 0..*)

  EClass Child
    EReference ref (type = Foo non-containment 0..1)

Model B (b.ecore)
  EClass Foo

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create an instance of Model A with one Parent that contains one Child where Child.ref = null
2. Create a copy of the model with a new resource set and create a new resource with an instance of Foo where Child.ref = foo
3. Merge the models

Here is how we are doing the merge:

Model model = library.getModel(false)

MatchResourceSet match = MatchService.doResourceSetMatch(root.eResource().getResourceSet() model.eResource().getResourceSet() Collections. emptyMap())

DiffResourceSet diff = DiffService.doDiff(match false)

for (DiffModel resourceDiff : diff.getDiffModels())
{
	List differences = new ArrayList(resourceDiff.getOwnedElements())
	MergeService.merge(differences false)
}

The idea is that you start with a model that has a parent and a child with no outside references the model is then changed such that the child has a non-containment reference to an object in another resource.  We need to merge the change into the original model such that the original model sees the new non-containment reference.

Here is the section of code that seems to have the problem:

When the merger gets to handleMutuallyDerrivedReferences() the switch statement takes the case EcorePackage.ECLASS__ESUPER_TYPES and fails when it tries to cast diff to a ReferenceChangeRightTarget.  diff is of the type UpdateReferenceImpl.  Here is the section of code in question:

private void handleMutuallyDerivedReferences() {
	DiffElement toRemove = null
	if (diff instanceof ReferenceChange) {
		final EReference reference = ((ReferenceChange)diff).getReference()
		switch (reference.getFeatureID()) {
			case EcorePackage.ECLASS__ESUPER_TYPES:
				final EObject referenceType
				if (diff instanceof ReferenceChangeLeftTarget) {
					referenceType = ((ReferenceChangeLeftTarget)diff).getRightTarget()

Per Marc Gille:

    Architecturally I guess we can leave it on the same architectural level as CKEditor:

        Require include for Rajesh's JS.
        Web Partial bound to a DIV in our panel.
        JS Controller initialized in our controller (where currently we are initializing the CKEditor).
        Additionally pass the SDT JSON for input and output access points to Rajesh to use it for screen generation.
        UI Builder becomes a third option in addition to external URI and embedded via CKEditor.
        Option does not exist for Stardust.
        We would provide Rajesh’s editor with the In/Out structures as JSON and as is.

Currently when validating bpel files many type of value or tags in the file should be right but the bpel validation reports error messages in problem view
I would like to list some of them for which I have created patches.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.LocationPath expression errors:
When open and validate the bpel file in the attachment it treat the tags which has the value like below as invalid


it reports error messages: the expression pol:receivePolicyQuote/pol:policyQuoteInfo/pol:ssn is not a locationpath

2. when validate  it reports the error message:
pattern is set to out on this  node but it can only be set to request request-response response
it is not right  in bpel 2.0 specification the pattern can be set to OUT IN and request request-response response

3.BPEL ReplyValidator try to compare the types between the reply variable type and the invoker web service input message type from BPEL specification
the reply variable should assign to web service output message so the validator reports the following error message:
variable PolicyQuoteResponse of type  is not compatible with WSDL message .

3.before validate bpel resource the validator is unable to delete all bpel problem markers which created by bpel validator it only delete the related markers in .bpel files but it should not be the right logic when validating a bpel file it validates all the bpel file referenced other types of files such .wsdl and .xsd file
so that if validate the same file *n* times the same bpel problem markers will have *n* records in the problem view.

4.when validating xpath function the return type of those functions are *Integer* such as the function concat(string str1 string str2)  then it generates a type
un-compatible warning message.

"PLATFORM-84359","Site caching uses wrong timestamps for some HTTP URLs","When caching site definitions by URL in 
InternalSiteManager.getSite() the 
update manager sometimes associates the wrong 
timestamp to the cached site. 

This happens when the site URL is http and refers to the 
directory containing site.xml rather than site.xml
itself. The update manager eventually finds site.xml 
but when it goes back to get the timestamp it looks for the
timestamp of the original directory URL rather than
site.xml. 

The wrong timestamp could mean that site.xml changes
on the server will not be picked up. 

The usage of a directory rather than site.xml directly 
is common possibly because the update site URLs for 
Eclipse work that way (for example
http://update.eclipse.org/updates/3.0)

A workaround is to directly refer to site.xml files
in the  element of feature.xml. 

Note that this problem does not occur for file:// URLs
because there is special code in FileResponse.getLastModified():

        File f = new File(url.getFile())
        if (f.isDirectory())
                f = new File(f site.xml) //$NON-NLS-1$
        lastModified = f.lastModified()

HttpResponse.

The problem is that edit hepler caches some values (such as contanment feature) during the first pass and the second time this method returns a different value because of that. There is no need to do a second pass since the creation context element (the owner) has alrady being calculated during the first pass and of cause it is costly. The problems manifest themselves in those cases when the context element is not an owner of the new element but just a refencer. In those case the feature passed down to the edit helper is null.

Hope this is the correct place for this bug. 

Using Eclipse 3.1M5 and a fully up to date WinXP sp2 & IE 6. The log file is
attached. 

The bug doesn't occur every time and strangly never if I put a breakpoint in the
app in the destroyWidget routine. Normally just starting the app and hitting the
close button is enough to generate this error.

The last swt code before the bug is 

void destroyWidget () {
	int hwnd = topHandle ()
	releaseHandle ()
	if (hwnd != 0) {
		OS.DestroyWindow (hwnd)
	}
}

My guess is that the test on !=0 isn't safe enough. Perhaps a test for it being
a valid window and !=INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE (defined as -1) might help here.

An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.

The path to the ctags executable and the option whether to use the default ctags from the system PATH or ctags from a fully specified path are not restored therefore these preferences does not survive if the preference dialog is closed and then reopened again.

In order to reproduce the problem:

1) Open Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Indexer
2) Select the Ctags Indexer
3) Select Use the specified Ctags
4) Select the path to the ctags executable
5) Select OK to close the dialog

"CDT-155878","CDT needs to know the exact architecture it's running on not what the JVM thinks it is","There are a number of places in the CDT where org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() is called to find out what the machine architecture is so that it can determine if for example gdb can debug a particular executable.

On most platforms so far just calling getOSArch has worked fine because typically people run a 64-bit Eclipse + JVM when running on x86_64 and a 32-bit Eclipse when running on x86.

However there is a different situation on PowerPC where many of the newer machines are 64-bit but there is only one 32-bit Eclipse built for PowerPC.  So when the CDT call getOSArch on PowerPC it always returns ppc regardless of whether or not the machine is actually ppc64.

At first I proposed a change to org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getOSArch() so that it would return a more accurate OS architecture value... in the PowerPC case ppc64 (when appropriate of course).

However this idea was rejected by the Eclipse core team because they want that value to reflect what the osgi layer says the machine is.

My new proposal is to introduce a new class in org.eclipse.cdt.utils called Platform.  It will mimic what the org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform class does except that it will return a more accurate value for getOSArch().

I will attach a proposed org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform implementation.",295,"1"

"SUBVERSIVE-243914","[Subversive] - Bug report ID-NQYYG","Greetings: 

I get this error(trace below) when I have an existing project attached to subversion via subversive. 1) I open eclipse 2) I open the project and 3) then attempt to run an update (or any other subversion operation). 

I do not have my credentials cached on purpose because I am using an office workstation and do not want other non-office servers creds cached on the workstation.  

To work around this issue I go to the 'SVN Repository Exploring' profile right click on the appropriate repository and select 'Location Properties'.  I then re-enter the creds in the imput fields there and DO NOT check the 'save these credentials' checkbox.  

Afer that I can go back to the project and can run any subversion options as normal until I close eclipse.

Two issue:

"GEF-283408","NullPointerException when calling Shape constructor thru Polygon default constructor","Build ID: 20090621-0832

Steps To Reproduce:

1.Subclass Polygon
2.Call a constructor of your class
3.You get NullPointerException in Shape.getLineWidthFloat because lineAttributes is null.

More information:

The problem seems that in Shape constructor setOpaque is called before initializing lineAttributes

Here is the stack:

It would be better if instead we showed a warning decoration if people attempted to use the splash template and the target platform <= 3.2.",165,"1"
