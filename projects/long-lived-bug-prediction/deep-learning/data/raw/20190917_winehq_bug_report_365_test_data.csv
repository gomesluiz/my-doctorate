"WINE-6415","windows web server app fails to send more than 11680 bytes !?","I'm testing a windows app I'd very much like to run under Wine being in touch 
with the author. This is a small web server app (called WRC for web remote 
center) based on the Microsoft MFC sample app HTTPSVR. It happily works under 
Windows but that'd be the wrong thing for running it 24/7.  -)

It's not yet working under Wine fails to serve larger files but we've pretty 
much narrowed down the problem by adding logs to the app and using ethereal.

For example the app tries to write a 25017 bytes .jpg image to the socket but 
the socket only allows 11680 bytes at a time and the TCP stack fragments this 
in 8 packets of 1460 bytes presumably because it only has 8 buffers reserved. 
So far so good.

We see them being sent on the Ethernet and the ACK's are coming in but 
after these 8 packets there should be a signal to trigger the OnSend 
function of the app so it can send the next part of data but this never 
happens... The reselection of the socket did not return an error. Given the 
reselection is ok and at the Ethernet level messages are consistently sent and 
ACK's received the conclusion is that there might be a bug in Wine. So here we 
are stuck.

The error is very simple WRC server processes a request and builds a response 
in a memory buffer called m_buf (member of CRequestSocket).

In case an image is requested it will realloc the buffer and read the complete 
image into the buffer setting m_cbOut to the number of bytes in m_buf which 
are to be sent.

After this the AsyncSelect( FD_WRITE | FD_CLOSE ) member of CRequestSocket is 
called to initiate the writing of data to the network this in done by 
MFC/Windows calling the OnSend member whenever the underlying socket is able to 
handle data.

In this function we send data and check for an error a partial send or a 
complete send. Every time a partial send is completed the AsyncSelect( FD_WRITE 
| FD_CLOSE ) is repeated so MFC/Windows will get back to us when data is sent 
on the network and this seems to fail.

So have a look at the code in if ( nBytes < m_cbOut ) this is what is being 
executed when we see that only 11680 of the 25017 bytes are sent.",82,"0"

Reverting the patch fixed the issue.
Disabling mmdevapi also works around the startup problem.

conclusion

Under Wine using CreateDIBSection 
for a 160*160 4bpp(16color) will result in a 16bpp
(65536color) bitmap creation wich will mislead the following <a href 
= #cmd3>SetBitmapBits. So our conclusion is that something may go wrong 
with CreateDIBSection intepreation of <a href 
= #pfb>Wine.

testcase

Hi all

I tired to enable visual style[1] for dialog in shell32.dll and comdlg32.dll. Normally a dialog will be themed by visual style when comctl32.dll v6 and InitCommonControls() was used.
I implemented a dialog in a dll and used 'Activation Contexts'[2] to let the dll depend on comctl32.dll and call InitCommonControls() but when the dialog was called by another program the dialog didn't be themed.

testcase.tar.gz is testcase I wrote for reproducing this bug.
You can reproduce the bug follow:
1. Install and enable a visual style theme in winecfg
2. Download the testcase unarchive it and make
3. $ wine main.exe click the 'OK' button. You can see button in the main windows was themed but two buttons in the dialog was not themed. (as picture testcase_wine.png showing)

Expected result:
The dialog also is themed as picture testcase_windows.png showing.

"WINE-22978","SimCity2000: race condition causes crash in MCI during startup","Created attachment 28457
mci+winmm trace & crash backtrace

The attached log shows a crash that is triggered because the asynchronous mciseq/mcimidi player is still attempting to open the device while the main thread already successfully called MCI_CLOSE.
The mcimidi player does not implement proper locking. Unlike mciwave its state variable is not yet set to MCI_MODE_PLAY when opening the MIDI device which lets MCI_CLOSE not see something is busy playing.
Actually even looking at mciwave one can construct unfortunate sequences of scheduling that would cause mciwave to hang in such a situation. So there's no trivial patch simply moving 
    wmm->dwStatus = MCI_MODE_PLAY
a couple of lines up.

The crash generally occurs when starting SimCity 2000 using
wine 'C:\Program...\Game\simcity.exe'
Curiously wine start simcity.exe always works. As I said it's a race condition.
It seems like sometimes the initialisation of WINMM and MIDI takes a long time.
The bug is then triggered when MCI_CLOSE is called by the application.

MCI_CLOSE is called among others when clicking exit in the initial menu.
Often enough the app crashes before showing this menu. IMHO the fact that the app calls MCI_CLOSE that early is triggered by another bug in Wine that AppDB testers have mentioned every now and often but never put to Bugzilla: SimCity 2000 starts fine (showing its logo) when using full screen mode but needs a resize or uniconify when using a virtual desktop: then presumably the app sends MCI_CLOSE to stop the music causing or not a crash via the present race condition.
BTW since the crash occurs in the asynchronous MCI MIDI player the app nevertheless works...

This issue has nothing to do with the bug presumably in the app that wine simcity.exe crashes whereas wine 'c:\full\path\simcity.exe' (should) work.",1913,"1"

This bug seems to affect only the Steam version of the game (the demo works fine): mouse clicks don't register in the main menu thus making the game unplayable.
I can move the mouse pointer freely on the screen hovering the cursor over any of the menu items it displays a tooltip but clicking on the buttons has no effect.
I tried with Wine's fullscreen mode and virtual desktop mode: the same problem occurs.

The only difference in the terminal log while starting the game that the following lines are not present in the (working) demo:

The following patch caused a regression in SimCity 3000

This regression is rather curious in that I had discovered it 4 months ago but
did not report it at that time. That is because I assumed the patch that broke
the program was correct and the problem was with our implementation of
MSVCRT.DLL. At this point I have re-evaluated the situation and have come to the
conclusion that the behavior of the loader is not correct. SimCity 3000 has its
own implementation of MSVCRT.DLL but with this patch applied wine does not load it.

As a matter of fact at this point there is no way I can get SimCity 3000 to load
its own MSVCRT.DLL without reverting the patch.

I have tried the following dll overrides and none of them work.

[AppDefaults\\sc3.exe\\DllOverrides]
F:\Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 3000\Game\MSVCRT.DLL = native
F:\Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 3000\Game\MSVCRT = native
msvcrt = native

I even tried copying SimCity's version of MSVCRT to my fake windows directory
with no success.

Wine won't load native versions of builtin files if there is one in the
app directory (this is a feature albeit a strange one!).
In other words: *move* the file *from* the app dir *into* the configured
c:\windows\system dir then load it natively and it should work.
IMHO while such behaviour may make sense it's been soooooo incredibly confusing
about a ton of times already that it ought to be killed for good (or at least
made configurable with default to *off*).

I'm currently working with the developer after experiencing an access violation error using the 32 bit version which I was able to run the debugger and submit a bug.  I don't know if that bug is related to this one.  I'm doubting it because the trigger of the error for the 32 bit experienced is not at process startup like this one I experience here.

Summary basically says it all.
Some models don't render where they're supposed to causing holes floating hair graphical weirdness.

This happens irrespective of whatever values are assigned to useGLSL AlwaysOffscreen StrictDrawOrdering etc or otherwise tweaking the workarounds flags available in the game.

It's as though things receive completely erroneous transformations as it is possible to travel outside of the skysphere used for the stars whereas this should never be the case and it's not everything either just some things.

Yes Duane confirmed. Your second patch in bug 1265 fixes this WAIT WINDOW 
problem as well. Same issue however with the window appearing on top of any 
foreground application on any desktop workspace. 
 
Are you going to submit your patch to be committed to CVS or did you need to 
do more testing first?  


The patch has been submitted. It makes sense (at least to me :-) and I tested
it with a bunch of apps too.

And yes the window insisting on being on top is a feature and separate from
this bug.

TCP/IP support ('cos IPX and serial modem support are obsolete...)

- The game uses Bink video and Smack video technologies to play in-game videos.
Smack video/sound support (used on in-game videos) and Bink music (used in the
main menu music theme) works like a charm but Bink video (used in the animated
main menu background) makes the game freeze (and sound collapse) for 10-15
seconds every time the background animation finishes and replays it. In Windows

This is probably a regression.
I see nothing in the error log (attached) to indicate where the problem is. All the error log messages look very familiar to me from past successful installations.
I hesitated to report it because I though the error must be mine. But I have tested carefully. 
I got the same problem even after creating a new Oneiric partition. I also got the same problem downloading 1.3 from the Ubuntu repository.
The attached log is from the current git version.

The RegistryValue method of the Installer object reads information about a specified registry key of value. If the key or value specified does not exist the method returns an error of 9 Subscript out of Range.

Wine MSI InstallerImpl_RegistryValue() returns HRESULT = 0x8002000B (DISP_E_BADINDEX) which seems to be right.
This code needs to be translated to VBScript runtime error code.
The equivalent would be something like 0x800A0009 ... if one searches for  Subscript out of Range. and VBscript.

Any service written in Delphi 6 (maybe in higher versions too) cannot be started by net start command. Surprisingly it starts during wine boot (if set to SERVICE_AUTO_START).

output from net start:
The Test Delphi service service is starting.
Service request timeout

Test service is attached including source code. Install test service by TestService.exe /install command. Remove test service from system by TestService.exe /uninstall command.

I track down the problem to programs/services directory where autostarted services are started with service names in first service argument (services.c scmdatabase_autostart_services) but services started by StartService WinAPI function (thereby net start command) without special arguments are started without any argument. Services made by Delphi always assume service name in the first argument.

Because Microsoft documentation allows no service arguments in StartService function but if there are arguments first of them must be service name I suggest modification of StartService WinAPI emulation code in programs/services/rpc.c as shown in attached patch.",1671,"1"

plain terminal output

FlatOut2 v1.2 crashes right after starting when DirectSound is selected as sound output in the game configurator (that's the default setting).
Strictly speaking this is not a regression: the game always crashed in former Wine versions as well when Alsa was set to emulation.
Now that Directsound hardware acceleration has been removed from Wine the crash is reproducible 'out-of-the-box'.

Workaround: need to select 'Windows Multimedia Waveout' option in the launcher (instead of the default DirectSound).

I can't reproduce the problem in the demo which is an older version of the game (1.1). The demo starts fine in current git (wine-1.3.29-245-g895b48e) even if DirectSound is selected in the launcher.

"WINE-151","dialog focus handling is not correct (e.g. in installers)","Many installers seem to have problems with their initial dialog

Roger Wilco's configuration wizard (property sheet imitation)
doesn't have a focus at all.
this configuration wizard has one dialog (cancel back next button main area)
encapsulating
*another* dialog. This seems to get messed up somehow and we end up with no
focus at all.
The key area to that clearly is the focus handling after WM_INITDIALOG in
DIALOG_CreateIndirect().
Note that Roger Wilco always returns FALSE for a WM_INITDIALOG indicating its
own focus
handling (which it obviously doesn't do).
Thus Wine jumps in and messes it up :)

Oh well after having spent some hours on this without a real solution (i.e. one
that doesn't just look
perfect in *this* case but apart from that busts any other program out there)
I think I'll just submit
Roger Wilco as one problem case.

If you get hold of some installer that has focus problems or other programs
then add them here please
in order to have a real collection of problem cases.",1725,"1"

I can confirm the same error occurs with GCC 3.1 and glibc-2.2.4. 
 
It is due to the nameless struct MONITORINFO which occurs in winuser.h. 
A temporary hack is to define -DNONAMELESSSTRUCT in the ole/Makefile. 
Doing this allows the compile to continue until it comes upon the next #include 
of winuser.h.  So far I've found it occurs in tools/bin2res tools/wrc
dlls/d3d8 and dlls/d3dx8 
and dlls/opengl32. 
Defining NONAMELESSSTRUCT in the appropriate .c file that includes winuser.h
also solves the 
problem on a smaller scale.

confirmed. 
 
I submitted a patch to fix the MONITORINFOEX structs. 
 
The IDL structs are a bit weirder though.

I am using ArchLinux with wine 1.3.19 and GnuTls 2.12.3 and ssl Support seems to be broken. As you can see here http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=19141
on the Topic Cannot connect for example I am not the only one having this Problem. The error I get is:

In English:

GnuTLS error: A fatal TLS-Alarm had been recieved.

I compiled wine with Debug enable. So if you have any further question please ask me.

More describtion:

I cant connect Via SSL anymore. Every ssl connection is going to be canceld. As I can see it is since GnuTLS 2.12.0 ... maybe a big change in GnuTLS? Pls take a look an it.

Temporary fix for the issue

Wine is using #msgctxt#directory#Desktop as name for the Desktop folder on my system resulting in folders with that name being created in the public and my own user profile.
I attached a patch which temporarily fixes the issue for me.

However I suspect this is related to the problem that I am compiling wine myself on a 64bit Debian testing where 32bit gettext libraries are not currently available so wine runs without gettext. Since this is an optional dependency things should still work properly though.",0,"0"

Make shell32 compile without WINE_NO_STRICT


------- Additional Comments From jdahlin@async.com.br  2002-11-18 06:47 -------
Since this is my first try to STRICT:ify a dll in wine i'm attaching it here for
review before sending to wine-patches.

If it's okay i'll continue and help with the other few dlls that's left.

One thing that worries me is if i should do:

if ((int)hInstance < 32)  

or

if (hInstance < (HINSTANCE)32)

Except from that should the fact that it's compiling without warnings be enough
shouldn't it?

At this point in time you should send the patch to wine-patches@winehq.com . You
will get far more review of it there. 

Please include a link to this bug report in your patch submission.

You should include a link here (in the Additional Comments:) to the patch in in
the wine-patches archive http://www.winehq.com/hypermail/wine-patches/ (this is
nice to do as it provides a good cross reference.).

Symptom/Failure:

The Witcher 3 or Crysis 2 (see https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44146) in menus using 3.2 with new buffer patch from https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42592 when browsing the menu before launching the game (here: TW3) the FPS is capped at 60 even though Vsync is turned off in nvidia-settings and the game.

Interestingly the game seems similarly to be semi-stuck/capped at ~20 fps when running.

How to reproduce:

1) Build recent master or 3.2 with the following patch https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42592

2) Disable Vsync in e.g. nvidia-settings.

3) Launch the game

4) Observe FPS while in the first menu menu

What should happen:

Using wine-staging 2.21 or older FPS runs into the 100s when in the menu without Vsync.",23,"0"

because of this. Wine doesn't respond to Ctrl-C both wine and wineserver need 
to be killed via 'kill -KILL' to get them to stop.
FreeBSD should currently have the definitions available to reproduce the 
functionality. The only problem I found when trying to fix it is how to get 
around MEM_MAJOR and the like considering FreeBSD no longer uses preassigned 
dev numbers at least according to the documentation I've read. This is new to 
20040408 I think. 20040309 had other miscellaneous problems with some things 
but I couldn't track any down svery pecifically but it 'more or less' 
functioned while 20040408 the current release will lock up on anything that 
uses NtQueryVolumeInformationFile.
This is reproducable by running winver or regedit among others which 
function. If you attempt to run winefile or even notepad it'll lockup 
immediately. Also if you load regedit it'll appear to function but you go to 
Import registry file it'll immediately lock up after calling

"WINE-4159","Regression: Wine Spins When Starting InstallShield","Prior to 0.9.4 it was possible to start the installation of the Garmin Trip and
Waypoint Manager.  Wine now spins before the installation starts.

I have isolated the cause of the problem.  It is due to the change in
dlls/ole32/storage32.c file specifically the SmallBlockChainStream_ReadAt()
function.  The spin occurs in the first do/while loop in the function
SmallBlocksToBigBlocks().

SmallBlockChainStream_ReadAt() function previously checked if the bytes read
equal the requested bytes.  The function was modified not to perform this check.
 Without the check the do loop in SmallBlocksToBigBlocks() never exits.

I corrected the problem by adding:
if (size == 0)
    rc = E_FAIL
before the ending return in SmallBlockChainStream_ReadAt() function.",12,"0"

When Google sketchup crashes which it does frequently google bug splat starts. If you describe what happens and send a report bug splat starts transmitting something but will never finish.

The installer runs fine then you need to run the file within which is given a random name (it's a bot for an MMORPG which users suspect may have client-side detection). That file starts up and falls over with the dialog detailing:

The procedure entry point ?_2@placeholders@std@@3V?$_Ph@$01@2@A could not be located in the dynamic link library MSVCP120.dll

Terminal output for the demo version of SASRT.

Attempting to launch the video game Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed results in a black screen/window. The game is unable to load its assets as these are located on several encrypted .M00 and .toc CD images as well as one .M01 CD image all of which Wine is unable to mount (the .M00 and .M01 files contain the raw CD data while the .toc files contain the file structure). All of these files are located in the game's Data folder.

I've tested both a purchased Steam version and a demo provided by Intel both yield the same result. You can see the terminal output for the demo on the attachment.

I've also discussed the issue on the WineHQ forums and the Steam forums:

"WINE-1265","ToolTip text is cut off (Visual FoxPro)","Bug comments restored from Gmane.org: 
 
Tooltip text is drastically cut off which is a big problem   
when working in the VFP IDE as Intellisense will tell a   
developer the syntax for the command being entered. 
 
Download my demo to reproduce.


------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2003-02-10 13:03 -------
This is being caused because this sequence of events is taking place. Early on
the app creates two DCs for the tooltip with a default size of 66x20 pixels. One
is an offscreen DC for working in (ends up being 0xa18 on my system) and the
other is the DC that is used to actually display the tooltip on the screen
(0xa14). When it comes time to show the tooltip the app moves and resizes both
DCs and paints and writes in the text to the offscreen DC. It then copies this
into the screen DC and sends a signal to make it visible. Up to this point
everything is fine. 

When the window is made visible some events are received from the X queue
which catch up the app. It sends two resize events to the offscreen DC the
first resizes back to 66x20 which effectively clips the rest of the tooltip
and the second resizes it back to the correct size. Unfortunately the contents
are now corrupted but the app is assuming the offscreen DC is ok. The corrupted
offscreen DC is then copied to the screen DC. 

When the tooltip is hidden and redisplayed the same sequence of events occurs.
Except this time the DCs were already at the correct size for the tooltip so
no resizing back to 66x20 occurs and the offscreen DC is not corrupted this
time. Even when the window is closed and reopened it continues to use the DCs
it has already created so no problem occurs.


------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2003-02-10 15:48 -------
And it looks like this patch fixes this bug. I am not real sure why this code is
here so will have to study more before submitting. And there are already lots
of patches setting in the queue already :-) 

An X ConfigureNotify event is a notification that a window has just been
changed. So it is not clear to me why Wine immediately then changes it again. I
will have to test with a bunch of apps to see if I can figure out what (if
anything) it is needed for.

Watch out for word wrap.

I didn't try your first fix but the second works!!  This is great for Visual 
FoxPro and Wine... 
 
One thing though not sure if this should be a separate bug report or not. If 
I display some ToolTipText and then switch to a different application the 
ToolTipText will be displaying on top of the foreground app's windows as well. 
Actually the ToolTipText will be on every desktop workspace on top of all 
other windows. I had previously noticed this phenomenon for dockable windows 
that were currently undocked in the VFP IDE so I'm assuming this is a 
separate issue entirely and will likely file a separate bug report in a couple 
weeks...

But NVShaderPerf seems to require XML parsing in a way wine does not support (or at least that seems to be the case according to console output).

Console output when WINE crashes

The  Mozart 11 software worked a bit sluggishly but reliably  with
wine-1.3.34.  Beginning with wine-1.3.35 WINE has a crash and freeze
when Mozart11 is starting. This is a complete show stopper and
continues in wine-1.3.36 and the latest git (cloned on 12-30-2011).
Another Mozart user who likes to keep WINE up to date has the same
result.

With Linux/Kde/wine-1.3.35 through 1.3.36 WINE draws part of the Mozart UI
then has a total lock-up that needs a kill -9  as root  to rid the
desktop of the zombie process.  This seems to be a regression.

Running bisect ends with this result:

Bug 1: The game runs in fullscreen mode but the Ubuntu menu bar and task bar hide a bit of the game display.

Bug 2: If several programs are running it is typically possible to switch between them by pressing Alt-TAB -- but the game won't show up! I only see the other programs I'm running.

Bug 3: The game changes my screen resolution from 1366x768 to 640x480. If I start the game press enter at the title screen and then exit my screen's resolution changes back to 1366x768 when I'm exiting the game.

Now try another thing: start the game press enter at the title screen and then new game. The stage will load. Now press the escape key and then exit (ゲーム終了 if you're using the default Japanese language setting). You should now be back at the title screen. Now you can repeat: enter and then exit. This time the screen resolution *doesn't* change back to 1366x768 and it is necessary to manually go to the display settings to fix the resolution.

Bug 4: If I Alt-TAB to another program the game still hides that program unless I'm also changing workspace.

Bug 5: The game is a 4:3 game but the image is stretched out on my 16:9 display. When using the same hardware but rebooting into Windows 7 I get a 4:3 image with black bars on the left and right sides. Thus Wine and Windows behave differently. Maybe this is because of a setting I'm not sure.

None of these bugs applies if I'm using the emulate a desktop setting in Wine's configurations. They only apply if this setting is unchecked.

I'm using the debian packaged version (unstable 0.9.52-1) explorer.exe crash every time when trying to remove folders.

"WINE-37834","RtlSetCurrentDirectory_U prepends UNC\ for network paths the resulting path is invalid","Created attachment 50382
cmd.exe output showing how UNC\ gets prepended when running cd \\server\share

Calling RtlSetCurrentDirectory_U with a network share argument like \\server\share sets the current directory to UNC\server\share. Subsequent calls to GetCurrentDirectory will return the modified path.
The resulting path is invalid and unusable: attempting to read the directory or writing a file to it results in ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND.
The bug can be reproduced using the internal command prompt as seen in the attachment.

From what I've gathered from the source code RtlSetCurrentDirectory_U calls RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U which prepends UncPfxW to the supplied path. The last edits to dlls/ntdll/path.c were made in 2003-2004.

I stumbled across this behavior while investigating why Total Commander cannot copy files to network shares. The sequence of calls in Total Commander is: SetCurrentDirectory to the network path then GetCurrentDirectory (which returns the modified path in the form UNC\server\share) and then it builds the destination parameter by concatenating this path with the destination file name. This gets passed to CopyFileEx which fails with ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND because of the UNC\ prefix.",1335,"1"

Crash report

I'm having problems running an old Win 3.11 game named Mortuum. Wine crashes before the game start. After some debugging I noticed the crash happens in file gdi32/driver.c on function DEVMODEW * WINAPI GdiConvertToDevmodeW(const DEVMODEA *dmA).

This function tries to memcpy bytes from the structer dmA to the structure dmW (that was allocated by a HeapAlloc()). Unfortunately it tries to copy -32 bytes because dmA->dmSize is 0 bytes and CCHDEVICENAME is 32 bytes. I've attached a small piece of code that shows where the memcpy is done around line 425 on that file.

...
    dmW = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap() 0 dmW_size + dmA->dmDriverExtra)
    if (!dmW) return NULL

    MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP 0 (const char*) dmA->dmDeviceName CCHDEVICENAMEdmW->dmDeviceName CCHDEVICENAME)

//===============================CRASH=========================
    /* copy slightly more to avoid long computations */
    memcpy(
//===============================CRASH=========================

    if (dmA->dmSize >= (const char *)dmA->dmFormName - (const char *)dmA + CCHFORMNAME)
    {
        MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP 0 (const char*) dmA->dmFormName CCHFORMNAME
                                       dmW->dmFormName CCHFORMNAME)
        if (dmA->dmSize > (const char *)&dmA->dmLogPixels - (const char *)dmA)
            memcpy(
    }
...

I tried to debug more to look for the root of the problem (why dmA->dmSize is 0) but there were too many calls and I couldn't figure out where the dmA structure was allocated and popullated.

I've attached the crash report and if you need the game to test just ask it's freeware. Tested on 0.9.44 and 0.9.45.",207,"0"

The app seems to want mfc42 and wsh installed so
I installed those first and while it reduced warnings
in the installer it doesn't prevent the problem.

grep ocx ~/.wine/*.reg shows lines like
@=C:\\windows\\temp\\IXP000.TMP\\'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Windows

The file msscript.ocx does not seem to be installed even though

So that subinstaller seems to both fail to install the control
and puts the wrong path into the registry.

to:

if (ret == 0)

return ret

and now it bleeding works. Of course that's a hack not a real fix.

Ret = 0 seems to happen in this case when the first if-case ret is being set by:
ret = dcDst->funcs->pBitBlt( dcDst->physDev xDst yDst width height dcSrc ?

Why is it not advisable to run wineinstall as root

Why does wineinstall further assume the current user has write access
to the wine source root? I don't see why I must chown my entire source
as a regular user then su to that user then install and be asked for
the root password so that wineinstall can install correctly.
I keep my sources in /usr/src and they are owned by root.
Perhaps wine should let me install as root if I wish to do so?

Why does wineinstall not allow the installation of a global windows root
Why can't it su to root and create one...or allow users to run it as root..

Why am I told to run wineinstall as root to generate a global wine.conf
(if I refuse to make a local one) when wineinstall refuses to be ran as root?

Finally why can't wineinstall be incorporated in: make install?


------- Additional Comments From andi@rhlx01.fht-esslingen.de  2003-04-06 15:30
-------
a) Because users use root WAY too often. It's a counter-measure.
b) because wineinstall configures the Wine environment for a *specific* user.
   (a Wine configuration is not global)
   Thus you need start with this specific user and when it wants to install the    
   Wine files on your system you are supposed to provide the root password.

> Why am I told to run wineinstall as root to generate a global wine.conf
> (if I refuse to make a local one) when wineinstall refuses to be ran as root?
Hmm if it still says that then it's a bug. A global wine.conf is deprecated.
Yep it's a bug.

> Finally why can't wineinstall be incorporated in: make install?
Because make install shouldn't do what wineinstall does. And the other way around.
make install simply installs the compiled Wine files on the system whereas
wineinstall is a one size fits all for lazy users which configures everything
down to the kitchen sink :-)

According to Suns Bug Database this error occurs with Java on WinNT.
Link for Suns Bug:

http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4879395

Wine is set to Win2k also tried the others (Win9x fails with Java at all...)

The Java app works perfectly with same the setup on Crossover 6.0 beta2.

Must be a error in wine itself not a missing registry entry i think because 
i tried the registry created by crossover with wine and it still fails.",718,"1"

"WINE-43159","The old game Knight Of Knight has black textures","Created attachment 58411
Screenshot in game

This is an old freeware game that seems to use DirectX7. It has a lot of issues but one of the most important one is that most of its textures are black.

When testing the game it's advised to check emulate a virtual desktop in winecfg since it only supports low-resolution fullscreen mode and is prone to crashes.
Also when you have a gamepad plugged in it might not accept keyboard input keep that in mind when testing.

To work around the other issues that crash the game please run winetricks gmdls directmusic d3drm d3dxof.

How to test:
To select an option press x. Just click through your way through.
When in Stage Select move left with the arrow keys then press x.
Press x again to start the game.

Now if you enter the game you should be greeted with very messed up textures they're very often black. You can move around with the arrow keys but the textures turn black for some reason when you move. They might also get visible again though.
Screenshot attached and download link added.


Now important thing to note: The game shows a blackscreen (except for the UI) in Win7 while the game worked in XP. Seems to work again in Win10.
Another thing to note you can make it work in Win7 by using the ddraw dll from wine 1.3.6 so it worked back then. Sadly the game crashes in wine with 1.3.6 so I can't really do an regression test.
But maybe it's also important to note that the game showed a complete blackscreen in 1.9.18 while it shows at least some textures in 2.10. If you want me to to a test which commit is responsible for the improvement just tell me.

Any help is appreciated.",724,"1"

from the line
wine: Call from 0x7b84b01b to unimplemented function shell32.dll.RegenerateUserEnvironment aborting I assume the said function has not been stubbed yet.

I installed Altap Salamander 3.04 x64 in LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 and did not apply my registration keys to reproduce a normal testing environment.

  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 wine ~/Downloads/as304x64.exe

I ran it normally and encountered a crash please see below for the basic output.

  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Altap\ Salamander/salamand.exe

Then I added WINEDEBUG=+relay to the command and produced a trace where AS' own crash reported kicks in. I deleted it for the second trace.

  rm ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Altap\ Salamander/utils/salmon.exe

I will send the traces separately. They are not immediately needed but they might serve as a future reference as I think Altap Salamander only started cleaning the environment recently. I have not been able (unlike Wylda!?) to run Salamander for a very long time and I _really_ miss it.

For future debugging I am ready to participate on IRC. I also have a Git version installed if a good soul creates a function stub :-)

Please note that the following output (which is short enough to fit in I hope) was created with salmon.exe already removed (otherwise there would be calls to MiniDumpWriteDump).

As described in bug 17195 SetNamedPipeHandleState is currently a stub and always returns FALSE.  Changing it to return TRUE causes one test to fail and currently todo_wine test to succeed.

I've also tried installing avisynth 2.5.8 and K-Lite-Mega-Codec-Pack-7.8

MeGUI will run. Update itself. Updates are stored in a local /update_cache folder as zip'd/7z'd archives. Gets to a stage of asking for a system restart. Whether you say yes or no (and manually shutdown MeGUI with the Exit menu option) the program eventually crashes. The Wineserver shuts down. Starting MeGUI again results in an immediate crash.

This a deal breaker for the software. The download MeGUI zip archive needs to be updated to extract the tools in the /update_cache folder. Otherwise there will not be any encoders available to use. Earlier installable executable version of MeGUI exhibits an identical crash when updated...

As soon as I choose to start a multiplayer game or a skirmish the game shows a screen for a bunch of seconds then crashes to desktop.
If I choose to start a new campaign I can select which campaign to start (there are 3: Rimtech Milagro and Neuropa) but after this the game crashes to desktop because of an unhandled exception (as you can see in the log attached).
I'm running on a Slamd64 12.0 machine with a Athlon 64 FX 55 (single core) CPU 1GB RAM and an ATI Radeon X800XT (with 8.7 Catalyst  drivers). This same crash occurs even on a HP Pavillion ze4900 laptop I have (Intel Celeron M 1.2 Ghz 512 MB RAM Intel GMA 82855 Graphics card) running Slackware 12.1 so I believe it is not related only to a 64 bit enviroment or to ATI proprietary graphics card drivers.
I tried installing the game in a clean WINEPREFIX but this didn't change anything.
I've set wine to run as Windows 98 and Windows XP but the crash still happens in both cases.

This was tested with Sacred Gold from GOG.com. I tried the original demo but it doesn't have the bug: the demo runs in 16-bit color mode whereas the problem occurs only in 32-bit color mode.
I reproduced the problem with Nvidia binary drivers 381.22 and with nouveau/mesa 17.1.4 too.

The problem: in-game characters are invisible.

While trying to use fluidsynth for synthesizing midi stream from a
windows application I discovered that wine considers it as a fm
synthesizer. I also got this message:

err:midi:MIDI_AlsaToWindowsDeviceType Cannot determine the type (alsa type is 100000) of this midi device. Assuming FM Synth

The attached patch makes wine consider it as a generic midi port please

"WINE-30071","Need a CreateTimerQueueTimer that is stable over time","Andrew Eikum's quick test in
http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2012-February/094457.html
suggests that CreateTimerQueueTimer stabilizes itself over time on *average*.  For instance when asked for a 12ms period it will trigger 5 times within 60ms even though it is unable to trigger every 12ms. The deltas are:
20 10 10 10 10 20 10 10 10 10 ...

This is an essential property that it would share with winmm timers.

Both winealsa and wineoss today crucially depend on this property.  The XAudio2 algorithm described in bug #28723 either writes one or zero period worth of data per callback.  Hence it requires callbacks to agree with frame consumption by the audio device.  If too late XAudio2 will not catch up by writing 2 periods.

What currently happens is irregular crackling due to occasional underruns because callbacks are further and further delayed and the audio buffers slowly empties.  Compare timestamps from apps using winmm with mmdevapi:
winmm mmdevapi
x.304 x.304
x.315 x.315
x.324 x.326
x.334 x.336
x.346 x.348
x.354 x.359
winmm corrects itself and manages to trigger all 10ms events on the same millisecond as the initial one: x.xx4.

CTQT accumulates delays because as its core queue_timer_expire uses:
 [t->expire =] queue_current_time() + t->period

I've separated this issue from bug #28723 because the root cause is not an audio component and because several other bugs mention CreateTimerQueue e.g. bug #29585.",363,"0"

"WINE-6832","40tude Dialog - control refresh lag","This is a somewhat irritating bug in richedit controls (probably - I'm just
guessing) that has been present in older builds of Wine too when running 40tude
Dialog. Of course this bug does not happen in Windows.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new post
2. Enter the following in the field:

Line 1
Line 2
      <- an empty line
Line 3
      <- an empty line

Then position the cursor on the beginning of line 3. Press backspace.
Explanation: as expected the first empty line is deleted and line 3 is pulled
where the first empty line was. We expect this:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
      <- an empty line

...but we get this:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 3

The reason is that the second empty line is pulled in place where line 3 was as
we expect but the place where line 3 was is not properly refreshed and we get a
ghost image of line 3 on the second empty line. It we minimize/unminimize the
window  drag it offscreen and then back - scrolling does the trick too - we get
what we expected but this is a rather annoying bug. I'm guessing it's a bug in
richedit controls.

"WINE-17195","Multiple applications and games need support for named pipe message mode (NamedPipe datagrams need to be _really_ datagrams)","ok after a little bit of investigation i think i understand the pipes code enough to be able to say what's going on and i'm seeing something like this:

process 1:

recvpipe = CreateNamedPipe(\\pipe\fred)
ReadFile(recvpipe buffer 
printf(length) ===> 43
ReadPipe(recvpipe buffer  /* no data */

process 2:

sendpipe = CreateNamedPipe(\\pipe\fred)
length = 9
WriteFile(sendpipe buffer 
length = 34
WriteFile(sendpipe buffer 


what's happening is that the data being sent down the pipes isn't being done as datagrams.  the implementation is using a stream-based fd.

the solution is: you _must_ implement a protocol on top of the pipes which sends the length (as a 32-bit int whatever) which is read off the fd followed by the data stream of _exactly_ that length.

_must_.  there's no two ways about this.

the protocol of Pipes is unfortunately a combination of both datagrams and streams.  datagrams because the lengths of data sent are absolute and inviolate.  streams because the data order and reliability are _also_ absolute and inviolate.

you can't use datagrams (because they're unreliable).  you can't expect all unixen to support datagrams on top of unix sockets (if that's what's being used).

so - you have to send the length as part of the implementation of the pipe-data-send.

sending a length will also solve the issue of trying to send zero-length pipe datagrams.

as a first implementation you _might_ be able to get away with assuming that when someone asks for some data they _will_ provide a buffer big enough.

virtualgalileo backtrace

Hi there
i'm using a sw for control Galileo a sound processor from meyer sound.
The software is called virtualgalileo a sw used to emulate a real galileo controller. The application crashed beccause:
wine: Call from 0x414f18 to unimplemented function KERNEL32.dll.GetSystemTimes aborting
A debug output is in the attachment.

The sw is downloadble from: 
http://www.meyersound.com/products/processor_drive_systems/galileo/616/register/form.htm

You have to register sorry...
The sw to download are two:
- Compass a sw for connect to real and vrtual galileo
- VirtualGalileo a sw to emulate a galileo (This is the software that crash)

Thanks for any attention

"WINE-12097","Wine 1.0 should not ship out-of-sync resource translations","As seen on http://pf128.krakow.sdi.tpnet.pl/wine-transl/ we have a lot of out-of-sync resources.

Sometimes it's menus missing only a separator and some of them are probably false positives (e.g. Korean dialogs declares a font while English doesn't. But they probably need to to have Korean characters. However it would be good to have a confirmation). But often these are missing menu items or stringtable entries. This can lead to shell folders (like My Documents) not to be created or empty strings like in http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/attachments/20060816/1a027491/add_app-0001.png .

I think as Wine 1.0 should be a stable release we shouldn't ship such resources. We could try e.g. to add an options to wrc to copy missing strings from English stringtables while for other resources surround them by #ifdef INCLUDE_BROKEN_RESOURCES that wouldn't be set when compiling Wine but would be used be used by the statistic scripts to notify the translators about broken resources. Another solution would be to use something like the po/mo files.",86,"0"
"WINE-27955","Warspear Online sound stops after a while (Pulseaudio + patched alsa-plugins)","Created attachment 35770
log file with WINEDEBUG=+tid+mmdevapi+winmm+dsound+oss+alsa+coreaudio

After having sound for a while usually seconds the game Warspear Online stops playing sounds. Just playing a little with the buttons in the menu triggers the issue.
Of course this behavior differs from Windows XP where all the sounds play OK.

Using OpenSUSE 11.4 which comes with Pulseaudio 0.9.22 alsa 1.0.24 kernel 2.6.37 etc.
Using the soundcard from a NVIDIA GT240 which passes the sound through HDMI.

I don't remember having sound problems before (with other apps/games) with this setup. This is my first time trying this app on Wine.

I tried changing hardware/emulation in winecfg and changing sample rate from 48000 to 44100 with no effect (same symptoms).
There is only one sound device selected.

At first I though it was the alsa-plugins bug that it's mentioned in the wiki but I already applied this patch:
http://git.alsa-project.org/?p=alsa-plugins.gita=commith=e1661e3daa22cfed67c4b74099bcd97b433af24b


The game can be downloaded at: http://warspear-online.com/files/warspear.exe
(8MB file)

How to reproduce:
 Run the app click MENU Settings then click repeatedly the top right arrow or other random buttons for a while (try to vary a little e.g. click Cancel then Menu another time repeat).
Every button should make a short sound. After a while clicking buttons the app doesn't make sounds anymore.
 Alternatively play the game for a while. Every skill should make sounds plus there should be ambient noise.

"WINE-34580","strtoul behaves incorrectly with negative numbers.","Created attachment 46055
Small test of strtoul showing bad behaviour with 64bit wine

Howdy ho I and Lee were messing around with some 64bit applications built via mingw and much to our chagrin something was reading the numbers incorrectly.

We got the expected results on native Linux native Windows (both mingw and msvc bins tested) but not on 64bit wine IF we built with mingw.

Investigating we tracked it down to wine's implementation of strtoul.

I've written up a small test case showing our use of strtoul. It should also reliably reproduce the errors provided it is...

1. built as a 64bit Windows application
2. strtoul is not inlined
3. It's executed in wine",3,"0"
"WINE-11590","Graphics regression in Uplink Laughing Man","When I try to play the Uplink Laughing Man demo it has many graphical glitches including one which makes it impossible to get past the second screen which I can only quit by using Alt-F4 or wineserver -k.  I had reported a similiar but not nearly as bad issue as 4889.  

I'd really like to provide screenshots but I don't know how to get screenshots from a full screen app.

The graphics (non-buttons) seem to be cut in half.
The buttons are much worse off.  The first button on the first screen you see is visible- but to click it you have to go up to the third sentence of text- then the button is highlighted and can be clicked.  It can also be pushed by using the enter key.

On the second screen the buttons are not there: there should be two buttons identical to those of the previous screen but they are not there and so you can not proceed any further in the demo.

I'm not sure what logging needs to be done and the only thing that shows on the console is this:

--- snip ---

Unfortunately the buffer of client fprintf() call was not written in one piece (buffered io) causing the parent to read only a partial string.
Due to crappy coding it crashes (2x strstr for '' won't work for partial data).
As seen in trace the first 4 bytes were directly written to pipe without any buffering.

The child process fprintf() call to stdout (pipe):

--- snip ---
...
0040111F   mov     dword ptr [40AEB8h] 40809Ch  offset java
...
00402007   push    4085DCh              offset to 1.5.0-b64
0040200C   push    dword ptr [40AEB8h]  -> java
00402012   add     eax 40h
00402015   push    4085E8h              offset to %s full version \%s\\n
0040201A   push    eax                  FILE *
0040201B   call    fprintf
--- snip ---

The first call to WriteFile() is actually the result of outputting first string argument after format string -> 40809Ch = java (len=4).

Each vfprintf() argument handler -> pf_output_xxx will immediately trigger an unbuffered write to the pipe(s).

It seems to me that buffered io should be still done even if stdout is connected to a pipe.

This is best viewed in open dialogs when they are not in report mode. 
 
Often items in the rightmost column seems fully visible. However clicking on 
such an item causes it to jump to the left. Of course the reason is that the 
listview code considers that the item was not fully visible and thus scrolls 
left by one column to make it fully visible. 
However I think this can be confusing. Also this does not appear to be the 
behavior on Windows (although that may have changed in more recent comctl32 
revisions) making it even more confusing.

"WINE-1977","When running Half-Life in software mode the screen is not updated","Hi there

the bug appears in Wine-20040121 and before (don't ask how long). I'm
using a linux only install. The problem is as follows:

When starting a game (i.e. telling HL to load a map) the Loading splash
screen is displayed but then the screen is no longer updated the splash
screen stays there until a redraw of the window (i.e. by hiding or
minimizing) is forced. The screen is then repainted in black and stays
black. The game itself however is running fine (you can tell because you
can hear sound when the intro starts or your footsteps when moving
around). When escaping to the menu the menu works.
Judging from a '--debugmsg +all' there are quite a lot of calls to
CreateRectRgn CombineRgn etc.. so those are probably involved in
drawing (I'm not a windows programmer myself). 'REGION_DumpRegion' is
also called a lot (btw: this does nothing more than producing trace 
messages. Is this a bug?). Finally there are calls to BitBlt GetDCEx
and consorts but not as many. I can provide a full log but it is 5 MB
in Size.

--- snip ---

The tool extracts installs and starts the kernel service.
Meanwhile the tool issues a request to mark the service for deletion - kind of auto-cleanup.
After that it starts polling of the service status to check if the service is actually running (it is).

The problem: Wine doesn't implement the deferred deletion of active services and removes the service entry while the service is alive (state 'running').
All subsequent service lookup/status requests fail because the entry is now missing from database.

MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682562%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

--- quote ---
DeleteService function

Marks the specified service for deletion from the service control manager database.

...
The DeleteService function marks a service for deletion from the service control manager database. The database entry is not removed until all open handles to the service have been closed by calls to the CloseServiceHandle function and the service is not running. A running service is stopped by a call to the ControlService function with the SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP control code. If the service cannot be stopped the database entry is removed when the system is restarted.
--- quote ---

While you're at it ... please add a TRACE to DeleteService():

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob/929d9fb9f79b9ba0b7392215e51a152ec709d62c:/dlls/advapi32/service.c#l1086

I used the 'service' debug channel first and lost some time because I didn't see the the service deletion part (it's only visible if one uses the heavy relay gun).
This would be consistent with other TRACE messages for service API.

    wined3d: Just use glBufferSubData() in buffer_direct_upload().
    
    It might seem like a good idea to try to use glMapBufferRange() in
    buffer_direct_upload() but it really isn't. The interesting cases for
    glMapBufferRange() are GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT or
    GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT but the only way for those to be set here
    would be for the buffer to be mapped with WINED3D_MAP_DISCARD or
    WINED3D_MAP_NOOVERWRITE before the buffer object was created. In that
    case the GPU is obviously not using the buffer object so
    glMapBufferRange() doesn't help. On the other hand if the buffer is
    currently in use by the application and neither WINED3D_MAP_DISCARD nor
    WINED3D_MAP_NOOVERWRITE is set glMapBufferRange() would need to wait
    for the GPU to finish using the buffer object while glBufferSubData()
    may decide not to.

The double quotes around the path *are* part of the key and cause the failure when trying to load the proxy (LoadLibraryExW with altered search path).

This works in Windows.

Best place to strip off double quotes before passing the path further is probably COM_RegReadPath() in dlls/ole32/compobj.c

I cannot use the mouse to select an area in the generated image to zoom in. In Wine there are two windows opened when you generate a new fractal. One of them is completely black the other one displays the actual image but cannot be activated (the window title is always greyed out).
In Windows only one window is opened which shows the image and the mouse can be used to draw a rectangle and zoom in. That's not working in Wine.

How to reproduce the issue:
1. Unzip the application then run it. Make sure you're running it in Wine's fullscreen mode in virtual desktop mode the various windows in the application are drawn behind the main window.
2. Click on Generation >> New in the Control window a new fractal is generated.
3. Now you should be able to draw a rectangle on the generated image highlighting an area to zoom in but that's ineffective in Wine.

There's no a single line in the terminal while running the application.

The same behaviour in Wine-1.0.1.

At some point menu options appear at the bottom of the screen and you can start a new game by pressing . You can hear audio from the game but the screen is still showing the corrupted loading screen.

Setting OffscreenRenderingMode to backbuffer acts as a workaround. One of the drawbacks of this setting is that the opening screens showing the graphic card and input setup are displayed upside down. Once the game begins to load the screen is displayed normally.
Performance is abysmal when you start a new game but I don't know if this is due to the backbuffer setting.

You *sure* that you are using 'builting' OpenGL ? What I find strange is that I
see this in the log :

00000009:Call kernel32.LoadLibraryA(4276478c opengl32.dll) ret=4271edb0
00000009:Ret  kernel32.LoadLibraryA() retval=42860000 ret=4271edb0

Whereas on my box whn OpenGL is loaded I get something like that :

08078610:Call kernel32.LoadLibraryA(0064b9e8 opengl32.dll) ret=005d7a77
(...)
08078610:Call user32.GetPropA(0001002042eddf7a __wine_x11_whole_window)

ret=4085e3ea
(...)
08078610:Ret  kernel32.LoadLibraryA() retval=42eb0000 ret=005d7a77

So I am pretty convinced that you must not use builtin OpenGL (or that you must
not have the same version of Wine than me :-) ).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No suitable graphics card found.

The device creation parameters contain invalid configuration options.

This program requires pixel shader 1.1 and vertex shader 1.1. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doesn't really reveal anything. So i decided to give a simpler xna game a try: 

http://www.phstudios.com/tutorials/xna/Paddles/Paddles.zip

Running this gives a lot more info in the console:

Unhandled Exception: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException: The device creation parameters contain invalid configuration options. ---> System.ArgumentException: The selected MultiSampleQualityLevel value is invalid for the selected MultiSampleType.
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.ValidateGraphicsDeviceInformation(GraphicsDeviceInformation devInfo)
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.CreateDevice(GraphicsDeviceInformation newInfo)

So the  The selected MultiSampleQualityLevel value is invalid for the selected MultiSampleType is apparently the bug. 
That's bug one then.

I can only do stupid hacks the hack 1 attached  gets the game a bit further. It then crashes with:

Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: The device name is not valid. Device names are in the form \\.\\DEVICE1
Parameter name: screenDeviceName
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.WindowsGameWindow.ScreenFromDeviceName(String screenDeviceName)
 
Apperently it's not happy with what wine returns for ScreenDeviceName. It expects something like \\\\.\\DISPLAY1 i think wine returns something like
\\.\\DISPLAY

With the hack/patch 2 the paddles game starts fine then.

The other Infimer game also gets further with the two patches but then halts at a sound error and still doesn't run :(. If a directx developer could have a look and fix this that'd be nice i think these bugs will affect all xna games",9,"0"

dsound-related crash backtrace

I'm testing with SNES9x 1.53 Wine 1.5.18 Lubuntu 11.10 x86-64 Nvidia driver 304.64.

I get a crash on changing the sound driver setting. To reproduce:
- Download and unzip the snes9x archive.
- Run snes9x.exe. You'll get a dialog saying Unable to initialize XAudio2 since Wine doesn't support that. Click OK.
- Select Sound->Settings... change Sound Driver to Snes9x DirectSound and click OK. The program crashes. Since it saved the DirectSound setting to snes9x.conf you get an immediate crash if you run snes9x.exe again without deleting or editing snes9x.conf.

The crash seems to be related to the sample rate. The default playback rate is 32 KHz. For me if I change Sound Driver to DirectSound and Playback Rate to 48 KHz there is no crash. I can load a SNES ROM and play it with (albeit crackly) sound. The crash happens when selecting any other playback rate.

(There is no graphical output in the default Direct3D mode which I'll hopefully file another bug for. You can select Video->Display Configuration... and change Output Method to DirectDraw to work around that.)

This looks like a regression. A regression test gave this:

I believe it has to do with the simulated bold font update since it was not present in Wine 1.7.3.

This bug is not severe but 'l's look like capital 'I's and overall it's either unreadable or ugly to look at.

I believe that the bug is caused by one of the following but I have absolutely no evidence to support it.

Akihiro Sagawa (3):
      gdi32/tests: Add tests for fake bold outline fonts.
      gdi32: Adjust fake bold outline font metrics.
      gdi32: Synthesize bold glyphs for outline fonts.

This bug does not adversely affect the software but makes reverting to 1.7.3 appealing. It does not (as far as I know as of now) affect Touhou Danmakufu ph3 at least not on the Directory listing.",1894,"1"

Everything works perfectly except that the sound fails immediately after the first loading screen (at the recruitment level)

I've had it work once every other time it's failed.
Game stability seems to be related to level of logging enabled for instance:

WINEDEBUG=warn+all causes the game to crash during the intro video (usually fine video and audio)

WINEDEBUG=-all+dsalsa does not although sounds does of course still fail.

I also included this which is the highest level for +all that works:

this is an issue introduced through commit id dc1a9f19c1f4c462f1e68e0def50e9c09812bc71.

See this (changes to libport):
http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=commith=dc1a9f19c1f4c462f1e68e0def50e9c09812bc71

The usual ./configure && make clean && make depend && make now fails very early when doing make inside libs/port.

Error states that widl isn't found. Manually building it also fails. I first had to do a manual make in libs/wpp and then tried tools/widl which fails with this message:
gcc: ../../libs/port/libwine_port.a: No such file or directory

To me this looks like some circular dependency thing going on. libs/port needs widl and widl in turn needs libs/port.

I believe this one is different from bug #24064 or bug #22053 even though gameoverlayrenderer.dll is involved in this bug report too.
Only a small number of my Steam games are affected. They all crash on startup with a backtrace that can be seen in the attached log. As far as I remember the problem appeared a couple of months ago I suppose it was due to a Steam client update.
Either native xinput1_3.dll or disabling gameoverlayrenderer.dll in winecfg works around the crash.

one of the main problems with current Wine msi is there are x64 installers that mix architectures in a single MSI package: 64-bit and 32-bit components (without a separate 32-bit installer for 32-bit components).

The first extracted 32-bit version that gets (incorrectly) extracted to system32 folder (remember: we're 64-bit install here) and subsequently gets overwritten with 64-bit version later.

For the registry the same applies: In order to create registry values in 64bit HKLM for components marked with msidbComponentAttributes64bit there is nothing to change in 64-bit installs.

For 32-bit components (attrs < 256) the registry stuff must go to Wow6432Node.
Ideally Wine's msi should also support something like msidbComponentAttributesDisableRegistryReflection to allow 32-bit components to write into 64bit HKLM but that's not required for now.

Updating wine to 1.1.43 causes a major decline in Starcraft's 2d graphics performance when running with DirectDrawRenderer=opengl set in regedit.

The graphics are now drawn so slowly that it's immediately obvious when navigating the menu screens. The game is unplayable as a result.

I performed a regression test which told me that e7a71e15b56d709c4623a472b0dc44ae6b336e08 is the first bad commit which had the description wined3d: Turn blit_shader color_fixup_supported into blit_supported. The full result is attached.

MediaInfo is the only program that I currently know of using regsvr32 in this way. There will be others.

Testers: be aware of ad-supported installer. Choose 'I do not accept' when asked if you want to install 'One System Care'.

The bug is caused by Wine's handling of regsvr32 arguments. We process them in a linear way whereas Windows processes all flags first.

Using a dynamic array of char or int would probably fix the issue.",57,"0"

problem I wrote a short test program in MSVC 1.52 (16-bit C) to display the
results of GetWindowsDirectory and GetSystemDirectory.  I ran this under Windows
XP and Wine under Linux and got different results:

Windows XP:
GetWindowsDirectory = C:\WINDOWS
GetSystemDirectory = C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

Wine:
GetWindowsDirectory = c:\windows
GetSystemDirectory = c:\windows\system32

The differences are the case of the names returned (particularly the drive
letter which I has a suspicion is tripping up the VB 3.0 installation) and also
the response of the 32-bit directory name for GetSystemDirectory.

I noticed this problem on previous versions of Wine.  Instead of accepting the
default Ubuntu upgrade to 0.9.33 I uninstalled Wine (including configuration

"WINE-32234","Missing dependencies on static / import libraries","strmbase is a static library which is used by amstream qcap quartz and 
others. This means functions defined in strmbase end up being included 
in amstream.dll.so and other places.

However modifying the strmbase code does not result in a relink of the 
dlls that depend on it. Note that this is true even if running make from 
the top-level directory. That makes it very painful to work with it.

The same issue could happen with other static libraries like 
dxguid uuid etc though those don't contain code and have little 
reason to change so that that's probably why the problem did not surface 
until now. This could also happen with import libraries though again the impact tends to be minimal (or at least manifest itself with a build error).

Comparison of wine 1.2 and 1.7.24

DC Universe starts itself up in a multi-stop process using a launcher. When Play is clicked on the launcher the game appears to start in a blank dos window that changes to full screen. Then a screen appears where one can select or create a character. Pressing play here begins actual game play.

To install and run DC Universe requires winetricks xact ie8 vcrun2005 vcrun2010

My machine is a core i5 desktop with radeon graphics (catalyst 13.35). I run opensuse 13.1 KDE with three virtual desktops which I switch between using ctrl-f1/ctrl-f2/ctrl-f3. 

For stable play the game has to be run using the Emulate Virtual Desktop option from winecfg. Behavior (or misbehavior) changes using recent wine versions. I am attaching an annotated log file comparing wine version 1.2.2

Summary

with wine version 1.2: if one does not run emulate virtual desktop the launcher appears and pressing play results in a minimized game window. If you open the window right away it is blank and if you don't open it right away you'll eventually know when the game is ready to play because you'll hear the music played at the character screen. Then you can maximize the window and play but switching virtual desktops caused the game to crash. With emulate virtual desktop selected in winecfg and set to full screen you can see that the launcher opens what appears to be a dos window (minimized). Opening it gives a blank window until the full screen game starts. If you leave it minimized you can always see the minimized window icon even after the full screen game starts (does not interfere with game play). 

With more recent versions of wine:
With emulate virtual desktop off in winecfg the game launcher will appear and pressing play will cause the game to start minimized just like in 1.2 but if you don't open the minimized window the game will freeze and crash. With emulate virtual desktop on the game will start normally and run will but will freeze when switching KDE virtual desktops.

There is this (freeware) game called Dink Smallwood which I would like to play  
and it almost works but not quite: 
 
You walk around in this game in a view from above (like in the old zeldas or  
ultimas) but wine does not draw the floor tiles which is quite annoying. 
 
The link to the game is: 
 
http://www.rtsoft.com/dink/download.htm 
 
There are two function calls which I believe to have identified as the  
culprits: 
 
DIB_DirectDraw_Blt 
 
or 
 
DIB_DirectDraw_BltFast 
 
The first function call complains saying that DBLT_ASYNC|DBLT_WAIT is not  
supported but as far as I understand the source code still everything should  
be rendered. 
 
The second function is also called a lot and here I am not so sure what  
happens. Is this function completely implemented? 
I think it is strange that the last argument is zero whenever the game calls  
it. I read the specification on the ms-homepage and it does not say that you  
can call it with a zero parameter. 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From tony_lambregts  telusplanet.net 2002-11-06

You can discount the warning about async/wait as this does not apply to the way 
wine deals with ddraw. The other function BltFast might be the culprit but you 
did not include the exact fixme/error message. I will try to get a look at this 
program if time permits. I have also CC:d Lionel who is the REAL DDraw expert.

I installed it with a very recent version of CVS (a couple of days ago) I have a

the mouse at the startup screen (I cannot see it). By guess and a liitle luck I 
was able to get a game started. I get a 3rd person view of Dink and have no 
problem moving around with the keyboard. The floor/ground tiles are white just 
like reported. I have not had much of a chance to play(debug) it.

Sorry when I posted the bug report I forgot to tell this: 
 
I also get the white screen at the beginning but after some time (maybe  
pressing the mousebuttons or something) I reach the start menu where the  
mouse pointer does not work. Continuing here requires a bit of patience: Moving  
the mouse around until a sign appears at the menu entry (this depends a lot on  
luck sometimes I'm able to do this within 3 seconds sometimes it takes me  
more than 1 or 2 minutes). 
Anyway it is possible to start the game just a bit difficult... 
 
To the question what the exact error message is: There is no error message  
(apart from the ASYNC-stuff). I ran with wine -debugmsg +relay... and looked  
through the messages displayed and I thought that DIB_DirectDraw_BltFast might  
be the problem but I have no clue at all. 
 
Thanks for your work on this.

Sorry for the trace inside the comment.I took a look myself at the wine-code and while I 
did not 
solve the real bugI found a smaller one in the debugging output which I have fixed 
(I'm veryproud 
of myself!!)As you maybe see in the trace but probably not the last argument of 
theSurface_BltFast-fnc is 0 and latter in the debugging output you see trans:but the 
value of trans (which is given by the last argument) is not displayed.The reason is the 
following 
(include/ddraw.h):trans = DDBLTFAST_NOCOLORKEY = 0but in dll/ddraw/helper.c 
the debugging output is 
generated by DDRAW_dump_flags_:for (i=0 i < num_names i++)    if (names[i].val & 
flags)          DPRINTF(%s  names[i].name)The if does not detect the case trans == 
0 so I modified this into for (i=0 i < num_names i++) if (names[i].val == 0 && flags == 
0) DPRINTF(%s  names[i].name) else if (names[i].val & flags)         DPRINTF(%s 
 names[i].name)I don't know if this is the fix like it should! 
  
 be or not but I'm proud anyway.I still have no clue why the game does not 
work.Cheers        Klaus

Yep that sounds like it's definitely a bug albeit a relatively minor one. 
I'd propose something like 
 
static void DDRAW_dump_flags_(DWORD flags const flag_info* names 
                             size_t num_names int newline) 
{ 
    unsigned int        i 
 
    for (i=0 i < num_names i++) 
        if ((flags & names[i].val) /* standard flag value */ 
        || ((!flags) && (!names[i].val))) /* zero value only */ 
            DPRINTF(%s  names[i].name) 
 
    if (newline) 
        DPRINTF(\n) 
}

I'm using

the game. I 
did an strace and I don't find anything about loadingthe files ./dink/Tiles/*.bmp.The

I would suspect that its something to do with konqueror. Lets see what I can do

VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH doesn't matter since it's on a non-VFAT partition 
and we just probe for VFAT properties. 
Apart from that no idea.

Today I'm using IE so I hope this helps with the formatting. 
 
Could someone tell me if the tile-bitmaps are loaded or is there some way to  
find this out? I guess that wine does not have problems with capital-letters  
and such in filenames (since Windows does not distiguish them as far as I know). 
 
Anyway in case this is not the error I have been doing some reverse- 
engineering in dink-smallwood maybe someone can give me a hint on what to  
test next: 
 
Basically Dink Smallwood uses a Display-Surface with a Front- and Backbuffer  
(640x480) an offscreen-memory-surface of the same size and some smaller  
surfaces containing objects. 
When the player enters a new room the offscreen-memory-surface is painted with  
the ground-tiles and this remains fixed until the player enters another room. 
Every time a frame is drawn the offscreen-surface is copied first to the  
backbuffer (to paint the floor) and then the other several objects (trees  
people etc.) are copied directly to the backbuffer. When this is finished the  
Back- and frontbuffers are switched and the steps above repeat. 
 
What I am wondering is why the objects are visible but the floor-tiles are  
not. The only differences I see for now is that the objects are copied  
directly to the backbuffer while the floor-tiles are copied first to the  
offscreen-memory and then to the backbuffer and the second difference is that  
the floor-tiles are stored in regular *.bmp files while the objects are stored  
in some format which I do not recognize. 
 
What could I test next? Thanks 
 
Klaus

I'm sorry about this fuzz with the strace where I didn't see the loading of  
the bitmaps. 
 
The problem was that these files are opened by another win-thread and this was  
not monitored by strace. 
 
To get it right you need to use strace -f wine dink.exe. 
 
What should I try next?

RobloxStudio wininet log

Hi it seems Roblox Studio cannot load games without using the winetricks wininet verb (which is bad because it causes a very long hang when loading) which is slightly frustrating.

The relevant stderr output is probably this:

The same message about UTF-7 not being supported is also mentioned in bug 18659 but this is probably a different bug.

Hack to remove display-flaws in ProjectOne

After installing and running the software the pixels in the zoom-mode and the grid are all black. So you can paint but will see the results in the overview window only. Selecting View->Palette shows also black boxes instead of the C64-colors.

I took this opportunity to get started with wine-hacking and finally came up with the attached patch which removes the above flaws. It is based on git as of yesterday but I could also apply it to 1.1.28 which I had installed on another computer. The problem itself was noticed way earlier maybe pre 1.0.0 but I can't give exact numbers here. I am aware this is not a true fix still it should be a good hint where differences between wine and Windows are. I am afraid my (yet) lacking windows-skills won't take me much further so I'll file this as a bug-report now. I will also attach screenshots before/after the patch later.

Note that this program was coded by a friend of mine and I do have the sourcecode. If worthwhile I can ask him for allowance to give the source to interested wine-developers (but beware of hackish first-time VB-code )) or just ask me for details if needed.",775,"1"
"WINE-28261","Original War: the user interface appears incorrectly (ddr=opengl)","Created attachment 36212
terminal output

I'm not sure if this is indeed a regression because the reported problems existed with previous Wine versions as well after one set directdrawrenderer to opengl in the registry.
Now that Opengl is the default ddr method the problem is reproducible 'out-of-the-box'.

Symptoms:
- the leftmost as well as the rightmost parts of the UI at the bottom of the screen appear without decorations (they're surrounded by solid black rectangles).
- under the character portrait text is drawn over making it unreadable.
- if you open up then close the in-game help window (by clicking on the '?' icon in the top row) the whole user interface becomes unusable (black).
- the screen gets messed up as you try to scroll the screen (this is reproducible only in the demo...the full game which is a newer version not affected).

Workaround: ddr=gdi

"WINE-2699","richedit behaves incorrectly with ES_DISABLENOSCROLL style losing functionality","Fully reproducible. A richedit control with the style ES_DISABLENOSCROLL (same

account for a large number of richedit-based applications that just won't work

I have determined that toggling this single style flag makes a richedit control
unusable. I compiled two bare bone applications with MSVC++. The only difference
between the applications was the ES_NUMBER style for the richedit resource (same
value as ES_DISABLENOSCROLL in order to disable scroll bars instead of hiding them).

Under Wine 20050111 (running on Slackware 10/GNOME) the test application with

Dmitry Timoshkov said over there:
You are using a different vdemo-setup version and as a result you have
a different problem: vdemo-setup-3210.exe checks for an advapi32 export
LookupSecurityDescriptorPartsA and crashes when GetProcAddress returns NULL.
Adding a simple stub to the .spec file (without any real implementation)
makes the setup work. I'd suggest to open new bug report and copy this my
reply there and one of our stub-experts pretty quickly will add a stub for
you :)

UFO:ET not only require native dsound/dmusic as reported in bug #25728 but also crashes unless native MS d3dx9_26 or d3dx9_36 are used. I had first ran into this bug with Wine 1.3.11 and it pertained till version 1.3.24. Can't test with later version due-to dsound/dmusic override workaround is no longer working as reported in bug #28340.

What's interesting is that is is sufficient to install native dsound/dmusic and only one of native d3dx_26/d3dx_36 to get the game working. With native d3dx_26 and wine's built-in d3dx_36 the game seems to start up faster than with wine's built-in d3dx_26 and native d3dx_36.

I attach essential WINEDEBUG logs recorded with Wine 1.3.24 + MS native dsound/dmusic + wine's built-in d3dx_26/d3dx_36.

I couldn't find an already opened bug for this one.

Currently I don't see the screen(all black) but when I press ALT+TAB it appears in the list of windows to change.
The focus is on starting a new game.
Pressing enter goes to the menu to select the difficulty (still all black).
Pressing enter starts the game which eventually crashes.
So 3 times pressing Enter makes the game crash. (for the black screen I'll create another bug if I cannot find any)

"WINE-7615","Regression Black screen in Halo","In 0.9.31 Halo worked better than ever. In 0.9.32 I get a black screen

or the menu after pressing ESC still get displayed (on top of the blackness)

Good (left) and bad (right) screenshots

Some sections of the Avast GUI have a black background in place of a gradient. It's especially noticeable in the dialog that appears on first run but there are also some occurrences of the problem within the main GUI. This is a regression sort of - the problematic patch was committed shortly before the fix for bug 29108 so it never worked in unpatched Wine.

--- snip ---

I left out multiple non-failing 'InitializeSecurityContextA' calls denoting different connection stages/phases.

The failing call to 'ApplyControlToken' returning 'SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION' is mostly harmless.
The last call to 'InitializeSecurityContextA' -> 'schan_InitializeSecurityContextA' also fails returning 'SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE'. .

That's on the connection/protocol tear-down path (SSL close notify message).

fContextReq = 0x811C -> ISC_REQ_STREAM | ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY | ISC_REQ_CONFIDENTIALITY | ISC_REQ_SEQUENCE_DETECT | ISC_REQ_REPLAY_DETECT 

Unfortunately the failing protocol sequence on tear-down path wasn't even responsible for the problem.
It took me some good hours to debug this out as the error code is internally maintained and propagated through some objects until the C++ exception is finally raised.

At one time during SSL connection sequence the client code checks if the required context attributes are met.
It specifically looks for 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' while Wine returned 0x100 ('ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY').

You need to handle (return) more context attributes at least 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_REPLAY_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_CONFIDENTIALITY' 'ISC_RET_STREAM' in addition to 'ISC_RET_ALLOCATED_MEMORY'.

I tested a fix and it allows to login with Desura visit market place download games etc.

"WINE-4952","joystick with POV and JoystickAImpl_SetProperty-proprange","There is a bug in dlls/dinput/joystick_linux.c . POV doesn't work when
application calls JoystickAImpl_SetProperty-proprange on POV. Function
calculate_pov doesn't expect that lMin and lMax can be changed. I know it is
strange to set proprange on POV but at least Il-2 Sturmovik demo 2.0 is doing it.

I have solved it with following small patch which ignores set proprange on POV
(it was easier than change constants in calculate_pov :-) but than get
proprange will not return previously set values if there would be application
which will call it.

"WINE-17222","Extreme slowness in multiple games - nVidia/KDE4/openSUSE","For many of the last few releases of Wine (somewhere not long after 1.0) I've experience extreme slowness across multiple systems and multiple games that wasn't present pre-1.0 or in 1.0 itself.

Specifically I've noted slowness that makes gameplay impossible in:

- Age of Empires (1997)
- Birth of the Federation (1999)
- Age of Empires 2 (1999)
- Medieval 2: Total War (2006)
- Star Trek: Legacy (2006)

The slowdown is significant and affects as you can see a wide range of games on three machines that I own all of which are more than capable of playing certainly the first few titles on the list.

Of the three machines I own and have tested Wine on the following are common threads:

- Running openSUSE 11.0 or 11.1
- Running latest Wine (1.1.14)
- Desktop environment is KDE4 (though no improvement running with GNOME)
- All nVidia cards (but range from an old FX5200 through to an 8400)
- All using Wine KDE4 and nVidia from openSUSE repositories.

That aside they have nothing in common. Two are 32-bit one is 64-bit. Two are running relatively old graphics cards one is running a fairly new one. Two are Intel machines one is AMD. Two have 512MB of RAM one has 2GB.

I like to do my bit for Wine by filing bug reports for various apps but this slowdown is hindering me somewhat! I don't know a great deal about how to start debugging but if someone can suggest to me how I can help diagnose this problem I'd be more than happy to help :)",193,"0"

1. The problem here is that keyboard is not working. Game asks for pressing S (start) Q (quit) etc. but there is no reaction.

2. Did a regression test between 1.1.34 and 1.1.34-469-g33a1934:

while checking out some 'World of Warships/Planes/Tanks' issues I've seen this turn off torrent downloader to avoid crash note multiple times in WineHQ appdb entries and also on various Internet sites.

Although this workaround solves the actual client download/updater problem it seems no one bothered to report this here for some years?

I could reproduce crashes with all 'World of WarXXX' clients using the torrent download mode.
The crash is caught before any registered JIT debugger ('AeDebug') as the client installs a top level exception filter.
Upon failure it simply displays a message box with the option to restart the download client.

Which leads to:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/boost/asio/detail/impl/win_iocp_io_service.ipp

There is a number of internal calls in between the crash site and Boost IOCP code ('op->complete()' -> 'win_iocp_operation' + function pointer call hierarchy).

Debugging/relay tracing a problem which seems to occur at random times in a multi-Gigabyte download also requiring high download speeds is not really funny :|

Anyway it's now documented here for reference.

It would be interesting to know if this torrent download problem occurs on Windows too albeit much less frequent.
Reading up some forums I got the impression...

I first note this in ACCPAC 5.0A screens but it can be demonstrated using for  
example the LISTHDR example from MSDN (with a little coding to force the issue). 
 
1. (Fixed) There were too many columns.  This was caused by  
LISTVIEW_DeleteColumn returning FALSE even though it had succeeded. 
 
2. The columns are one column too far right.  MSDN documents the process of  
adding a temporary first column before adding the real columns and then  
deleting the first column in order to allow non-left-justification on the real  
first column.  The current code does not correctly maintain the column order  
list (including such issues as handling partial order arrays etc.) 
 
Basically the dlls/comctl32/header.c code needs to be beefed up for the  
following messages:

HDM_INSERTITEM(A/W) 
HDM_DELETEITEM

"WINE-7768","server should set process affinity","This is perhaps two bugs rather than one but they're so closely related I'm
entering them as one.

The server (in process.c) always initializes the process affinity (in the
get_process_info handler) to 1.  On Linux it's possible to get a process's
affinity using sched_getaffinity - the server should initialize a process's
affinity using this instead.

The server also prohibits setting a process's affinity to anything but 1 (in the
set_process_info handler) failing with STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.  This seems
somewhat arbitrary.  First it could fake accepting the affinity as long as the
affinity mask doesn't contain CPUs which aren't present (see bug 7766).  Second
it could set the process's affinity on Linux using sched_setaffinity.",929,"1"

"WINE-11729","Unreal Tournament: dinput mode makes game unplayable","Hi there

new Unreal Tournament bug after the error on exit bug was fixed. This one is different however because it has to do with input.

The problem is that once you active direct input in the UT configuration menu and restart (so the change becomes active) the input sort of stops working.

What exactly happens:
I'm currently not talking about being in-game. I'm just in the menu where you land after pressing ESC in the intro sequence. Upon pressing ESC you end up with the cursor in the upper left position on the virtual windows (currently using virtual desktop so debugging is easier).
The first entry of the game menu is opened automatically (Game) and I can now move the cursor through the opened game entry selecting the children. Or I can move over to the next entry (Multiplayer Options Stat Tools ...) and select children there.
OK this is when dinput is OFF.

Now I go into the options activate dinput and leave the game. Then I start the game again and encounter this.
Upon pressing ESC the cursor is still transferred to the upper left position and the menu opens.

What is different:
When clicking the menu away (click on non-menu components) and then trying to open them again (by clicking on them) the menu item won't open (no drop-down effect). I can hear the soundeffect of the menu opening but nothing more. I can even click something (suspecting that the menu is invisible but there). So the only thing I can do is switching the app to window mode (there is a button in the upper right corner that does that) and then use the X-button on the window to close the application.

Another difference is that marking checkboxes doesn't work anymore. I was going to make another try and restarted the app this time moving right into the config menu to deactivate input. This works because ESC always lets the menu pop up. However removing the tick from the checkbox proved to be impossible.

I had to modify the UnrealTournament.ini to switch dinput off.

I created a log from the dinput run going to attach this.

This is a catalog type file hence the pFile members can't be used for SOFTPUB_GetMessageFromFile() e.g.

data->pWintrustData->u.pFile->hFile and data->pWintrustData->u.pFile->pcwszFilePath

will be invalid upon entry.

You must use catalog file handle and data->pWintrustData->u.pCatalog->pcwszCatalogFilePath just like you do with CryptSIPRetrieveSubjectGuid() for SOFTPUB_GetMessageFromFile().

When using BabasChess v3.6 from [1] it seems to crash quite randomly in
different situations.

Attached is output for a particular crash which happened while just observing a
game in FICS. (I was unable to try BabasChess with WINEDEBUG=+relay because it
was too slow so I used just wine path/to/BabasChess.exe)

Other crashes have happened in different situations e.g. when starting to move
your piece while playing.

===== Steps to Reproduce ====

Start wine path/to/BabasChess.exe. Use it until it crashes.
Sometimes you need to use it quite long until you get a crash.

Warcraft III freezes after a few seconds/minutes. This bug probably appeared in
0.9.18 as I've just managed to play a 29 minute long game on 0.9.17. Wine
versions I tested from http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/index.html (for
6.06):

0.9.18 0.9.24 and 0.9.39 for Ubuntu 7.04: freeze

After the game freezes the only thing you can do is login via ssh and killall
-9 war3.exe. It seems that it only affects ATI based cards no matter what
driver (either Mesa or ATI's fglrx). However with Mesa driver the game runs for
about 5-15 minutes while with fglrx for 0-3 minutes (sometimes crashes just
after the loading screen).

I managed to generate four logs with different WINEDEBUG options and put them
here: http://toya.net.pl/~julas/w3-wine/ (should I post them here as well?)
I tried disabling sound but it still crashes (maybe a few minutes later).
Running wine with aoss removes dsound underruns.

Moreover there appears a kind of 'hiccup' even under Wine 0.9.17 and older. A
short maybe 0.5-1 sec. freeze. And I guess the first such freeze appears more
or less at the time when newer versions crash. It usually happens more than once
in a match which may be annoying but the game is still playable.

According to my tests Wine-1.3.22 is the first version which is able to start the game (without crashing) and the problem is already there.

Here's how I did it: I found the smallest DLL inside the FileOptimizer Plugins folder which happened zlib.dll. I copied that file twice to the main FileOptimizer folder renaming one of them to bthprops.dll and the other one to blutoothapis.dll. (They had to be lowercase.)

screenshot (comparison)

When you start a new game or load a previously saved game the user interface in the game is rendered correctly. After opening and closing the in-built help screen the user interface becomes corrupted so that only the character portrait and the minimap can bee seen everything else is replaced with black rectangles (see attached screenshot).
Plain terminal output doesn't show anything.
I tried and reproduced this bug with Nvidia binary drivers 340.96 because the game doesn't start properly with Nouveau.

Tested with the following game versions:
1.09 (demo version)
1.10 (stock version from GOG.com)
2.0.3.5 (the latest patch)

1.09 and 1.10 versions use DirectDraw renderer exclusively newer patches allow the player to choose between the default ddraw and opengl renderers: the issue occurs only with ddraw.

The problem was introduced by

commit 821c2ed6a3478fadeafe7c64213b5f0af5f19d57
Author: Henri Verbeet 
Date:   Fri Dec 4 11:30:15 2015 +0100

    ddraw: Do not mark surfaces as lost unconditionally when setting the cooperative level.

To reproduce the problem in the demo version:
1. Install and start the demo with OwarDemo.exe
2. In the main menu choose  select the U.S campaign (blue icon) press  to skip the video. The game starts with a conversation press  to skip it.
3. When you gain control over your character press the  icon in the upper menu bar to open the in-game help scene.Close the screen with the checkmark button in the lower right.
4. You should see that the main user interface is missing decoration buttons etc.

Bug 12852 was initially about this problem but that app no longer ships with this dependency and the issue went out of focus.
Therefore I create a separate bug for this extrac32.exe tool.

A wine-devel thread talked about this tool some time ago:

http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-July/057886.html

It looks like the Ethersoft guys went their own route ...
A google search didn't really come up with useful info.

Although it says the tool is part of Internet Explorer all installers will detect IE already installed in WINEPREFIX and do not attempt to install any earlier version (like IE4).
Hence Extrac32.exe will never be installed as prerequisite.

Extrac32 is the win32 gui version of the console extract utility from Microsoft Cabinet Software Development Kit. 

--- snip ---
EXTRACT [/Y] [/A] [/D | /E] [/L dir] cabinet [filename ...]
EXTRACT [/Y] source [newname]
EXTRACT [/Y] /C source destination

  cabinet  - Cabinet file (contains two or more files).
  filename - Name of the file to extract from the cabinet.
             Wild cards and multiple filenames (separated by
             blanks) may be used.

  source   - Compressed file (a cabinet with only one file).
  newname  - New filename to give the extracted file.
             If not supplied the original name is used.

  /A         Process ALL cabinets.  Follows cabinet chain
             starting in first cabinet mentioned.
  /C         Copy source file to destination (to copy from DMF disks).
  /D         Display cabinet directory (use with filename to avoid extract).
  /E         Extract (use instead of *.* to extract all files).
  /L dir     Location to place extracted files (default is current directory).
  /Y         Do not prompt before overwriting an existing file.
--- snip ---

Maybe another attempt can be made by someone to get this tool in to fix older installers.

"WINE-12689","Input messages lingering in server slowing down wine","Created attachment 12347
testcase for problem

Attached testcase illustrates the problem. The problem was originally found in a fan-developed Forsaken mod. I couldn't get feedback on this on wine-devel so I'm opening a bug for this. Close if it's not a bug or is non-fixable.

How to reproduce: hold a key and move mouse over the window preferably also clicking mouse buttons main loop latency steadily increases from 10 to 50 (and even 100) in a short time. In a game this means going from 100 fps to 20 or 10 just because of input messages. Has to be noted that in the actual game the rate of slowdown seemed at least 2-3 times faster when just holding one key and moving mouse for reasons I don't know but the testcase still should enough to show the problem.

What the testcase is doing is bad practice it's basically refusing to process certain types of messages and PeekMessage just once during a loop is probably bad as well but that's what the game was originally doing in its main game loop. There are several concerns about it:

1) No slowdown happens on Windows either in game or in this testcase. No matter how much I move the mouse holding key and clicking madly it shows same stable 15-16 ticks latency in the testcase. I don't know what it does but somehow it handles this situation better than Wine.

2) Can this (broken) way of doing things be exposing some inefficiency in message handling maybe something that could use optimization? I tried to put debug hacks into queue_hardware_message() it seems that when slowdown is already VERY bad in Forsaken (10fps) message queue in wine server has about 400 or maybe 600 messages. Is that kind of processing overhead per message inevitable? (This is happening on AMD Athlon(tm) 3200+). Perhaps somebody who knows that part of code well may be interested in looking into performance issues in this case. Because if 400-600 messages in the queue slow down the application to a crawl then who knows perhaps it decreases performance of more well-behaved but input-intensive apps as well just less drastically (holding one or several keys to move all the while aiming with mouse and abusing mouse buttons is a common thing in games so there can be quite a few input messages flooding the server).",1234,"1"

"WINE-28023","CoreAudio queue memory leak","While working on a patch to fix the Get/ReleaseBuffer ordering see bug #27184 comment #3 I found a bug in memory management in winecoreaudio's mmdevapi.

510      HeapFree(GetProcessHeap() 0 This->public_buffer)
but public_buffer originates from
1625      sc = AudioQueueAllocateBuffer(This->aqueue bytes
1626              
The APIs don't match.  It currently doesn't crash because
public_buffer is NULL upon regular exit.  This matches:
1634     AudioQueueFreeBuffer(This->aqueue This->public_buffer)

That would be easy to fix but it leads to question how AudioClient_Release frees the buffer queue.

502      if(This->aqueue)
503          AudioQueueDispose(This->aqueue 1)

I suppose that Dispose gets rid of all the MacOS-level elements left in the queue but I doubt it can handle the additional AQBuffer that Wine links to every object via the mUserData slot.

1632      buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap() 0 sizeof(AQBuffer))
1640      This->public_buffer->mUserData = buf

Therefore I believe Wine must iterate through the list (aqueue or avail_buffers?) and free remaining objects one by one.

As I'm not familiar with the MacOS API's I'd like somebody knowledgeable (Andrew Ken?) to check this issue and write the patch.

BTW I believe that correct freeing should first return
This->public_buffer into the queue -- where it originated -- like I did in my ordering patch then delete the whole queue.

	no sound with (latest) ALSA intel8x0 driver

Cause

	i810_audio driver enables record and playback triggers on open
	wineoss respects the current triggers Intel ICH3 (the /dev/dsp
	controller) will read data on playback.  Since the client is not
	draining the input buffer there is an overrun and disruptive
	error handling with poor real time audio behavior ensues.

	intel8x0: traced it as far as mmap failure (EIO) in wineoss.

Possible Solutions

	Patch the i810_audio driver to disable PCM_ENABLE_INPUT on open

		#if 0
			dmabuf->trigger |= PCM_ENABLE_INPUT
		#endif
	
	Hack wineoss to disable the triggers on (device) open since it
	carefully preserves them thereafter.

	Use better hardware (Intel ICH5 does not exhibit this behavior)

Verification

	Patched the i810_audio driver and QuickTimePlayer works great.

Details

	I recently purchased and installed Crossover Plugin 2.0.2 and
	installed the WinDoze QuickTime plugin (6.3 per the FAQ --
	thanks).  All this on my Dell Inspiron 4150 using a chipset
	with the Intel ICH3 running RedHat 8.0 with the latest kernel
	2.4.20-24.8 installed.

	There were no problems playing sound with xmms.  However I had
	poor sound via QuickTimePlayer with the native i810_audio
	driver so I installed the latest version of ALSA (1.0.0rc1)
	and configured the intel8x0 driver.  Worse now I had no sound
	with QuickTimePlayer.

	I enabled debug channels and discovered that some mmap call in
	wineoss was failing with EIO when using ALSA.  But I also
	noticed I had dma overrun messages using the simpler
	(non-ALSA) default i810_audio and decided to investigate that.

	The Cause and Solution above report my findings.

that is (I guess... hmmmm) more a problem of memory handling in wine. 
 
I made a little test app here the results in wine and win2k later on 
the app itself :

    Type                : MEM_IMAGE 
 
Well dunno too much about Type field I didn't find an app that check it yet 
I did find the app that uses Protect flag I think it's poor coded but as  
usual we should make bad apps work too :-) 
The app put some data in code page not yet spotted if hard or soft-coded 
then before reading it checks Protect field to see if it has not set the  
PAGE_GUARD NO_ACCESS and WRITECOPY flags if t has it hangs some 10.000  
lines later (sigh....) 
I think wine should set Protect flag quite as like as possible as windoze 
 
For AutoCAD2000 I put a dirty hack in process.c but is really ugly i'd  
prefer not to put my hands (bytes ?) too deeply inside some code that I don't  
understand completely...  
 
Attached is the test source (compiled in Borland CBuilder but should work  
with any compiler apart some unuseful pragma's). 
If needed I can post the compiled too :-)

after the splash screen and will not go away until the main program is closed.
I'll attach a screen capture to clarify.

Terminal output before reverting the ntdll commit

Hi folks 

The game No Man's Sky (GOG version) has stopped working in Wine 1.9.17. 

After running a regression test I have found that the following commit breaks Wine compatibility for No Man's Sky: 

commit 4af2012729b7ad656fe240838697eeb2ce5c924e
Author: Piotr Caban 
Date:   Wed Aug 17 12:48:24 2016 +0200

    ntdll: Pass updated context inside dispatch.ContextRecord in call_stack_handlers.

Reverting this commit lets No Man's Sky work again. 

Some info: 

I tested this with the original GOG copy of No Man's Sky before it received any updates via GOG.com to ensure that the issue was not due to an update to the game breaking Wine compatibility. 

I came to the conclusion that there was a regression introduced because after updating to a freshly git pulled copy of Wine 1.9.17 the game would no longer start and the attached terminal output is what I would receive after attempting to run the game. Please let me know if you'd like any kind of log from a version of Wine that is not compatible with No Man's Sky or at least let me know which channel you'd like for me to set WINEDEBUG= to so that I can get you the necessary data to fix the seemingly faulty commit.",6,"0"

backtrace

As the summary says. Attempting to start PSP 6 with a clean .wine directory causes it to complain about needing mfc42.dll. If a native mfc42.dll is provided it then crashes with an Unhandled page fault on read access before the expected splash screen appears.

The mfc42.dll I'm using probably comes from Windows 2000 as that is the last Windows version to which I have access.

While I've filed this bug for the version of Wine I'm currently using (and in which I can therefore prove the error occurs) I don't think there has ever been a version of Wine under which PSP 6 started successfully.",918,"1"

Next http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu hints that you should go for stable rather than development release so I did especially as I've never known a bug submission process that requires you to be running a beta. But that's what I was told to do in the comments when I actually submitted bug 29398 & bug 29399

I've since had http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#head-0bae04b4126dffb8a08bf020982badacb6f367ff pointed out to me which more strongly hints the opposite - that you should run the development release.

More clarity about this in the instructions presented to users when lodging bug reports would be a good idea. The barriers are high enough already - yet another account to register for (openoffice google code sourceforge...) system to get the hang of & process to learn. I'd already put this off for months.

pol.exe refresh problem when in windowed mode

In windowed mode when you move app's window that only part is visible then in this partially visible state is not correctly updated.

1) Probably nobody can explain that better than Henri

I think what happens is that the blit is rejected because it's partially outside
the screen. While moving the window to the outside that isn't very noticeable
but as soon as you move it back you see the now cleared parts of the window
that don't get updated until the window is fully inside the screen again.

2) Another test scenario:
When app's window is only partly visible and then resized it becomes black.


Attachment shows the 1st test scenario (they are probably related thus in one bug report).

This bug is regression. About 6 months ago everything was fine. It begins ~4 months ago. I don't know what causes this problem so I started wine with WINEDEBUG=+all and tried to find where it hangs.

crash with no dll overrides

La-Mulana will crash on startup due to incomplete dmusic support
If dmusic (and its related dlls) are set to override to native dlls but no native dlls are supplied the game will run but without music. Sound effects will work fine.
If native dlls are supplied for dmusic dmime dmsynth and dmband the music will work as well.(This produces a slew of fixmes from dmstyle and dmloader yet the builtin implementation of those two dlls are good enough for the music to work)
If no overrides are set the game will attempt to use the builtin implementation in wine and will crash.

The ONLY dll override necessary to make the game run without music(whether or not you supply a native dll) is WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dmime=n

with WINEDLLOVERRIDES left at  we get a crash:



Other crashes occur if of those 4 dlls listed above dmusic is left as builtin and the others all native or if dmusic is left native and all the rest builtin. The crash is slightly different if dmloader is native.

La-Mulana is freeware and can be obtained from http://lamulana.super-turbo.net/LA-MULANA.zip
The japanese to english translation patch inside that .zip file works fine in wine.


P.S. Somewhat unrelated: with the builtin implemnentation of dmband (and native dmusic dmime and dsynth all others builtin) the console messages indicate that it is certainly trying to play the music and is incrementing through the music files (which are directmusic .sgt files) but is unable to actually produce sound",1124,"1"

 I 
gleaned that file MSForms.TWD is a 'temporary' file used by ActiveX controls. 
 
In the case of Intellicad 98 I beleive it is created by FM20.DLL the Microsoft 
Forms 2.0 Control. On a hunch since my crash was being caused by an 
oleaut32.dll call I configured Wine to use the native oleaut32.dll and lo! 
Intellicad 98 ran. 
 
I'll give it a test drive for a few days and work out any bugs before adding it

"WINE-41437","Implement a 64-bit version of __std_type_info_hash","Two weeks ago I saw commit 4931e6f92bc7e0c229a057ebf2e000f8f5aa1edd that (partially) implements __std_type_info_hash function.

Code was simple but the 64-bit version was not implemented as it was using different constants.
I thought: Findind a coefficient only requires time and patience let's do it!.

I had to find a value (noted as  here) that is such that (0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc1 ^ 0x1) *  = 0xaf63bc4c29620a60 or 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 *  = 0xaf63bc4c29620a60.

I started with a naive implementation computing all  values from 0 to UINT64_MAX.
Was very long and very slow.
I optimized it using OpenMP (#pragma omp parallel) causing all my CPUs to work at 100%.
Still very slow and the topmost bit would be tested in ages.

I then had the idea to use a (pseudo-)random non-repeating number generator. This way all numbers would be tested in (pseudo-)random order and equally distributed on the 64-bit range. Plus with the known seed and index it would be posible to stop and continue the computation at the point it stopped.

I chose Blowfish algorithm and let it work for about a week and then realized I may need a better solution. Finding the 32-bit  value was very quick (less than a minute) but a 64-bit value is way larger and testing every bit takes a really long time.

Normally if I have something like 5 *  = 15 I can do 15/5 = 3 = .
Here we abuse overflow so mathematically it's more (0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 * ) mod 2^64 = 0xaf63bc4c29620a60.
I discovered we can actually do Modular multiplicative inverse to find an inverse of a number.  such as ( * a) mod x = 1
(a * ) mod x = b -->  mod x = b * 

I found a C++ implementation that finds the inverse of a number modulo another.
I started with the 32-bit version to test it (no mod 2^32 to make it concise):
(0x811c9dc5 ^ 0x1) *  = 0x040c5b8c
0x811c9dc4 *  = 0x040c5b8c

0x100000000=2^32
modInverse(0x811c9dc4 0x100000000) -> no inverse because 0x811c9dc4 is even

Anyway let's do it with 0x2:
(0x811c9dc5 ^ 0x2) *  = 0x070c6045
0x811c9dc7 *  = 0x070c6045
0x811c9dc7 inverse is 0xdce213f7

in other words (0x811c9dc7 * 0xdce213f7) mod 0x100000000 = 1
so 0x070c6045 * 0xdce213f7 =  = 0x1000193
we can verify that 0x811c9dc7 * 0x1000193 = 0x70c6045
and that 0x811c9dc4 * 0x1000193 = 0x40c5b8c
-> we have our 32-bit coefficient.

Note that 0x100000000 requires 33 bits so it's ok on my 64-bit computer but as you may have guessed 0x10000000000000000 (2^64) is 63 bits.
I tried using uint128_t but didn't work.

I then used GMP library (The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) which lets me work on numbers as big as I have memory.

Let's do it again for the 64-bit version (mox 2^64 omitted):
(0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc1 ^ 0x1) *  = 0xaf63bc4c29620a60
0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 *  = 0xaf63bc4c29620a60
0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 has no inverse because 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 is even

(0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc1 ^ 0x2) *  = 0xaf63bf4c29620409
0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc3 *  = 0xaf63bf4c29620409
0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc3 inverse is 0xdbab92123bd8a8eb
in other words (0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc3 * 0xdbab92123bd8a8eb) mod 0x10000000000000000 = 1

so 0xaf63bf4c29620409 * 0xdbab92123bd8a8eb =  = 0xa01b8255ca379c43
we can verify that 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc3 * 0xa01b8255ca379c43 = 0xaf63bf4c29620409
BUT 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc0 * 0xa01b8255ca379c43 != 0xaf63bc4c29620a60

I tested with 0x2 0x4 0x42 inverse is ok but  was always different and wasn't working: I was missing something.

I googled 0x1000193 and found out that it's a well-known number used in FNV-1 and FNV-1a hash algorithms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function).

Ideal 64-bit  (called FNV_prime) is 0xcbf29ce484222325 which slightly differs from our 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc1. Since only the low word is changed I guessed it was a XOR operation on the low part. I tested 0xcbf29ce484222325 ^ i == 0xcbf29ce44fd0bfc1 in a loop and found i was 0xcbf29ce4. I retested with other values et voilà I found how it worked!

I just submitted a patch to fix this bug.

I posted a detailed explanation here to prove I didn't disassembled the native DLL and maybe to tell people it's not that hard to do useful things in wine. By the way it's a fun way to learn things!",2,"0"

terminal output during childbirth scene

I have been experiencing this since 1.1.44 all the way through to 1.2-rc7 but my investigation revolves around rc6 so that's the version I'm reporting.

My specs:

Linux Mint 9 Isadora 32-bit
wine 1.2-rc6
nvidia 7900GS (AGP) 512MB driver 195.36.24

new wine prefix
only vcrun2005 installed via winetricks (only because the Launcher won't run without it)
new install of Fallout 3 patched to 1.7

The issue presents itself immediately upon entering the childbirth scene. With some versions of Wine my father would not even say his initial line (I don't have sound in the childbirth scene like everyone else but I do turn general subtitles on before running the game for the first time). In this case the baby-cam continues to move and the visible characters continue to animate but there is no further progress (or so I thought) forcing me to ESC and quit.

With RC6 Dad does say Let's see... are you a boy or a girl? as expected but this does not trigger the expected gender choice dialog. Again the visible characters continue to move (the game is not crashed or hung) but the dialog doesn't appear so one can't progress through character creation.

This time instead of quitting I ESCaped to bring up the main menu then chose 'Continue' rather than Exit to re-enter the running game and hit 'E'. Lo and behold the gender choice appeared. I chose my sex and Dad said his next line (It's a girl? A girl!... etc) and then the game halted before Catherine (Mom) could say her line. ESC=>ESC=>E got her to say her bit.

In this way (ESCaping out to the menu choosing Continue and hitting E when back in the Play screen-- sometimes twice as the scene is running a bit slow but that's just me I think) I was able to get to the penultimate moment of the scene where the baby (me) is moved out of the room which should trigger a whiteout to the next stage before you even reach the door. In this case I was pushed all the way through the door and into the hall-- which I had never seen (thank heavens they made a hall on the other side of the door) and this time it required 3 ESC==>ESC combos to trigger the whiteout (because Dad has like two separate speech sets and maybe the whiteout is also similar in terms of how it's triggered).

At no time did the game crash hang or stop at times Dad would look right and then seem to stop but the blinking lights on the monitors in the back of the scene always continued even if the actors seemed to be frozen. The system seems to be that if there's a player dialog triggered (gender choice name choice appearance) then getting that dialog to appear and making your choice(s) will cause the following response line from whatever actor (Dad usually) to be said automatically but any further speech (response from another actor triggering of another dialog) has to be done manually.

There's nothing much significant-seeming in the terminal log but it's attached anyway.

In any case if this can be confirmed the only reason it avoids being a blocker (to people starting a new game) is that there appears to be a workaround slow and tedious though it is. But I certainly for several versions didn't even play FO3 because this appeared as a blocker to me before I happened upon the workaround.

Please confirm or advise as to possible other causes native to my system or Wine installation.",752,"1"

crash log of winecfg audio tab crash

When I click on the Audio tab in winecfg it begins to crash. First it displays this message:

There is no audio driver currently specified in the registry.

A recommended driver has been selected for you. You can use this driver or
select another driver if available.

You must click Apply for the selection to take effect.

When I hit OK on that message winecfg briefly stays up with no menu options in
the open tab and then crashes. Crash log is attached.

I thought this might be a duplicate of bug 4051 but since wine no longer uses
arts it can't be. Still it seems to be a similar problem.

plain terminal output

When playing any Steam games the desktop mouse pointer is always visible on the screen during gameplay.
In some of the games the desktop cursor follows the path of the game's native mouse pointer.
In other games the desktop cursor is stuck in the middle of the screen (while the native pointer is working correctly).

So far I couldn't reproduce the issue in non-Steam games. Moreover the issue came to my attention only today so it might has something to do with the latest Steam client update.

foobar2000 crash handler log (alt-f)

Not-really-duplicate of Bug 7205 reported in 2007 and closed in 2008.

I'm using foobar2000 1.3.10. I first encountered this issue on Ubuntu 16.04 Cinnamon and Wine 1.6.2 x64 on a (I think) 32-bit wineprefix.

# Setup

* I also replicated this issue in Wine 1.9.10 32-bit (PlayOnLinux).
* To (hopefully) avoid foobar2000-specific tweaks I used [Install dialog] -> _Install a non-listed program_. Then I created a new app profile and 

# Instructions

* Install foobar2000 1.3.10.
* Open foobar2000. Press [Alt-F].

# Results

* foobar2000 crashes. The internal crash handler catches the crash and pops up a dialog.
* I clicked View Report and saved a crash log.
* Note that this bug is somewhat random. I've experienced GUI corruption Wine crash handler foobar2000 crash handler or no issues at all.

# Notes

* [Alt-Enter] crashes.

* [Alt] *focuses* the menu bar without crash. [Alt Enter] opens the File menu without crash.
    * Afterwards [Alt-F] etc. still crashes.

* Clicking on any menu opens that menu without crash.
    * Afterwards [Alt-F] etc. does NOT crash.
* Clicking the right-click menu keyboard key opens an undo/redo menu.
    * This also prevents crashes.",831,"1"

    wined3d: Clean up buffer_internal_preload().
    
    The conversion should never be performed for buffers with
    buffer_type_hint other than GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.

The game works properly with the previous commit.

This version doesn't have an installer but instead provides you with a pre-installed environment and asks you to install vcredist.msi and XLiveRedist1.0.6027.msi manually.
XLive worked fine with msiexec /i vcredist.msi doesn't ( err:msi:ITERATE_PublishAssembly Component not set for install not publishing assembly ) so I skipped it.

When starting the game complains about numerous missing libs ( XINPUT1_3.dll  msvcr80.dll  msvcp80.dll ). I have used the xinput from one of the dll sites out there and installed the msvc*80.dll with winetricks ( vcrun2005 and vcrun2005sp1 ). So in theory the msvc*80.dll should be provided in windows/winsxs.

Trying to launch the game now fails miserably. To put it simply:

err:module:import_dll Library MSVCR80.dll (which is needed by LC:\\windows\\system32\\xlive.dll) not found
err:module:import_dll Library MSVCP80.dll (which is needed by LC:\\windows\\system32\\xlive.dll) not found

as Jesse Maurais said in http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=5425 its impossible to load a game in UT2004 he described quite well the symptoms. In my case i can play the first preliminatory matchs on single player mode nexts never finish loading.

I just:
-rm -r .wine directory
-installed wine 1.1.23
-created the ./wine
-install Steam
-link steamApps dir and update UT2004
-Accepted the UT license and refuse install directX (cancel button)
-the game is running on OpenGL mode by the .ini config file

When the game runs in fullScreen mode and closed the screen config is altered and shows pretty much lightness (See attached PNG). When running windowed mode it not happens but freeze in the moment you can see in the attachment too (run first in fullscreen break my screen config and twice in windowed then freeze and taked a screenshot).

"WINE-14774","Max Payne 2: PP effects flood console with GL errors (ORM=fbo)","Hi there

this is a regression introduced between wine-1.1.0 and wine-1.1.1 bisecting turns up these commits:
[2d4d18b59dc26b8aee04553671b942071d9213b9] wined3d: Delay render target activation.
[4f77c29bcf58a88cea8fb833f770aa107960b34e] wined3d: Track depth stencil location per-surface.

Actually I had to do two bisects one separate for the glReadBuffer error and one for the two other messages.

Affected game: Max Payne 2 (demo)

Wine settings:
OffscreenRenderingMode=fbo
UseGLSL=disabled

Ingame settings:
PostProcessingEffects=medium
PixelShaderSkins=off

Hardware: nVidia Geforce FX 5900
Drivers: nvidia-drivers-173.14.09

GL errors only show up when PP effects are used in the game. There are two types:
(a) bullettime using a sepia tone filter
(b) cutscenes using a motion blur filter

GL errors depend on whether (a) or (b) is currently active:

For (a) I get these GL errors:
(*) fixme:d3d_surface:read_from_framebuffer_texture >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_ENUM (0x500) from glReadBuffer @ surface.c / 913
(**) fixme:d3d_shader:shader_arb_deselect_depth_blt >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_OPERATION (0x502) from glBindProgramARB(GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_ARB vertexShader->prgId) @ arb_program_shader.c / 1832

And for (b) those:
(*) fixme:d3d_surface:read_from_framebuffer_texture >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_ENUM (0x500) from glReadBuffer @ surface.c / 913
(***) fixme:d3d_shader:shader_arb_deselect_depth_blt >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_OPERATION (0x502) from glDisable(GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_ARB) @ arb_program_shader.c / 1840

Note that the errors don't show up with ORM=backbuffer.

This are essentially three errors I marked them each with asteriks. Notice that the (*) GL error happens in both modes.

During bisecting I noticed that the (*) GL error was introduced a different commit than the (**)/(***) (which are introduced by one and the same commit).

For testing both wine versions (1.1.0 and 1.1.1) the sourcecode was patched with http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=commith=2583975ec799527cebc3238916394390c913b842 to not hit the slow driver fallback. Wine did only use ARB_tex_rect for NP2 textures then.
This can also be achieved by commenting out the ARB_tex_npot extension line in wined3d/directx.c

The GL errors still show up with wine git master (last commit: b572170da5f35a80c6bb07ab8ebcda7a854f27f) there with an additional GL error:
fixme:d3d:apply_draw_buffer >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_OPERATION (0x502) from glDrawBuffers() @ context.c / 1064

However this one (the draw buffers one) should be fixed in latest git.

The (*) GL error is introduced by the commit:
[2d4d18b59dc26b8aee04553671b942071d9213b9] wined3d: Delay render target activation.
(Adding Stefan Dösinger to CC)

The (**) and (***) GL error is introduced by the commit:

"WINE-28180","Operation Flashpoint crashes with sound enabled","Created attachment 36104
terminal output

In the current git version (wine-1.3.26-312-g3ce59f5) Operation Flashpoint:Cold War Crisis crashes if sound is enabled in winecfg's Audio tab.

The problem can be reproduced in the demo too. Unlike the full version of the game the demo dies as soon as the main menu appears. The full version of the game (v1.96) works fine in the menus but it crashes when a mission is about to start.

This is due to the following commit:

"WINE-13476","SQLyog community edition : Cannot connect to a remote DB through gSTM tunnel","Created attachment 13396
Results of WINEDEBUG=+winsock wine SQLyog.exe > SQLyog-debug.txt 2>&1

Hi

Since wine 0.9.61 (previous versions worked just fine) I am having problems connecting to a VPN remote database through ssh tunnel forwarding using gSTM. My localhost is set to stefan and the gSTM port 33061 is forwarded to port 3306 on the remote machine.
Connections to a local database on my machine works OK and all other internet connections work OK as well.
SQLyog does not crash it only displays a standard error message complaining no connectivity to the DB.
Every time I downgrade to 0.9.60 it starts to work again.

regards

winedbg backtrace

This was tested with the GOG.com version of the game no demo version has been released.
The game comes with the following native dlls placed in the game directory: msvcp100 msvcp100d msvcr100 msvcr100d. The problem doesn't occur when using native msvcr100.dll.

If I use Wine's built-in msvcr100 the game freezes when I start a new game from the menu. The screen is not refreshing but menu music is still playing. The 'Dracula4.exe' process and wineserver consume only 1-2% CPU all the time. At this point in-game videos should be played. The same freezing occurs if I choose  from the main menu.

Now comes the tricky part that makes debugging complicated (at least for me):
-if I run the game under winedbg (wine winedbg Dracula4.exe) then starting a new game is working the videos are playing but the game crashes as soon as the last video ends.
- the same scenario happens if I start the game normally but redirect the output to a file: 'wine Dracula4.exe >dracula.log 2>&1). Just like when running under winedbg the game gets past the videos and crashes when the videos end.
- if I start the game with debug channels enabled e.g. 'WINEDEBUG=+msvcrt+tid wine Dracula4.exe >>msvcrt.log 2>&1' then the game doesn't crash at all it plays the videos and the game continues normally after the videos.
- if I start the game normally let it freeze and attach winedbg to the already hung Dracula4.exe process then I receive a backtrace as can be seen in the attached log file.

The same patch was identified in bugs 21825 and 21946 both of those bugs were closed as fixed by commit f3696e489b8b33011b5a32acf330f0684b6d151a. 

Reverting the patch identified by the regression test gets rid of the crash but the Program Options box still doesn't appear. Instead the app throws up a warning that resources are dangerously low and telling me to close some programs and possibly reboot. So something else is also going on but I'm afraid I don't know how to proceed from here to track it down. I'm happy to run more tests if someone can tell me what to do.",14,"0"

The resource include chain is as follows:

resource.h
windows.h (due to RC_INVOKED defined by wrc) -> winresrc.h -> winuser.rh and commctrl.rh 

The problem is that winuser.rh defines only a subset of winuser.h control ids
This breaks resource scripts which for example reference standard dialog button IDs.

Telling the user to explicitly include  solved his problems.
You might want to extend winuser.rh a bit to include often used standard control ids (ex: dialog button).

"WINE-11281","CJK input: cannot type in legacy applications","Created attachment 10369
An approximation of Japanese legacy application

There are so many issues I don't know where to start.

The good thing is the input sort of works so there must be something present in Wine that handles it one way or another. However it is unusable in its current state.

First a CJK font is needed which is not normally present in Wine. Also Wine cannot pull characters that do not exist in current font from other fonts so all relevant system fonts have to be mapped to something that actually contains the characters.

For Japanese the font Kochi Gothic is quite useful but it does not contain much in the latin range.

Now in the Wine notepad the Japanese characters are displayed only if you go to the font selection select a font with Japanese characters and select the Japanese script. I don't know why is that some Latin accented characters are displayed even if Japanese script is selected but not the other way around.

Now typing Kana (and even Kanji) works with scim in notepad except the cursor is always positioned in front of the part just inserted (is not moved after inserting characters). Doing some cursor movement appears t orestore the cursor to the right position.

However typical win32 application is codepage based and would only work with SJIS encoding. After generating a SJIS Japanese locale and executing the included test application with
LANG=ja_JP ./testwin.exe
I get the text displayed correctly. Unfortunately now the input does not work because scim runs in UTF-8 and wine in SJIS. This is the same as any other X applications run in that locale. However starting a whole X session in an obscure Japanese locale is not a solution (although it seems the application would work).",494,"1"

"WINE-42074","osu! - Audio latency regression (ALSA)","Introduced in wine 1.9.10 still present in 2.0-rc3. Copying my description from a comment on another issue.

Hello I'd like to describe my experience with the added sound latency. I'm the author of https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40716

I'm using ALSA (no PulseAudio) with patched winealsa.drv for reduced latency. The patch is simply changing three constants at the top of mmdevdrv.c (DefaultPeriod MinimumPeriod EXTRA_SAFE_RT) to lower values (the ones that work for me: 22000 22000 11000 respectively).

On wine 1.9.9 and earlier where everything works fine this results in an extremely low (almost none) audio latency which is good. Reducing DefaultPeriod and MinimumPeriod lower makes the sound crackle a lot. Reducing EXTRA_SAFE_RT doesn't seem to change anything.

On wine 1.9.10 and above the minimal values of the constants seem to be around 10000 and 10000 for me below that there's no sound at all (there's no crackling stage). The audio latency is much higher (both on good values from wine 1.9.9 and on the new minimal values) which makes the game feel much worse.

Debug output for Emulator2.exe

When executing Emulator2.exe from the Samsung TV SDK 3.5.2 (from http://samsungdforum.com) the program immediately exits with the following error:

    Unhandled exception: page fault on read access to 0x00000000 in 32-bit code (0x00409373)

Full output with the command used to launch is attached.  As for the SDK itself that fails with a similar error message but it's just an IDE (and/or a plugin for Eclipse) and much of the functionality can be reproduced with other applications.  The emulator is the only part of the SDK whose functionality cannot be reproduced in a Unix environment.

I've attempted various suggested workarounds such as changing to the .exe file's directory before execution and running from a 32-bit Wine prefix.  I've also tried several older versions of the emulator with the same result.

Now that bug #40219 is fixed the game can be started using the built-in msvcr120.dll

The menu works I can select missions difficulty and playable characters.
The problem arises when trying to enter the game: instead of loading the first level the game rotates 2 screens forever and the game never loads. One of the screens is a black and white Neo-Geo logo the other is a white screen with some corrupted textures on it.
 
This is probably a bug in built-in msvcr120.dll because the game works properly when using native msvcr120.dll.
Actually the game automatically installs MSVC++ 2013 you only have to add the override:
msvcr120=nativebuiltin

In the long run keyboard navigation like this will be essential for the

Yep I agree. I noticed that by setting transitions to best it becomes really 
obvious what is happening. It is supposed to scroll the window left or right 
and then paints in the new portion of the display. It does it with calls like this: 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -1810 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
which as you suggest causes a BitBlt: 
trace:bitblt:BitBlt hdcSrc=08dc 1810 24 bpp->hdcDest=08dc 00 427x392x24 
rop=cc0020 
For some reason that does not seem to be working. Only the new part is being 
painted in. The scroll never happens. I never got much beyond that point. 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From tony_lambregts  telusplanet.net 2002-07-18

:BitBlt hdcSrc=08dc 1810 24 bpp->hdcDest=08dc 00 427x392x24 rop=cc0020 
OK. This looks (to me) like the source and destination are the same. hdcSrc and 
hdcDest both = 08dc. Based on my experience with SimCity's screen corruption I 
am inclined to be suspicious of this. The other thing about it is that it is 
24bpp and as Lionel says its evil  
 
source x = 181 
source y = 0 
destination x = 0 
destination y = 0  
width = 427 
hieght = 392 
  
So my assumption is that you clicked on the right side of the screen and the 
left hand side of the screen is not getting updated right? 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2002-07-18 17:48 ------- 
Yep that was a click on the right. And of course there is a series of quick 
scrolls of various sizes corresponding to the various sized pieces left on the 
right side causing the screen corruption. 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -1810 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -810 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -810 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -820 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
trace:scroll:X11DRV_ScrollDC 08dc -600 hrgnUpdate=0000 rcUpdate = (nil) 
I think 24 bits is only because that is what my video card is set for so that 
is what wine is using. Riven itself is only 8 bit color as I recall.

Well I've tracked it down to this code snippet 
 
    case SRCCOPY:  /* 0xcc */ 
        if (dcSrc->bitsPerPixel == dcDst->bitsPerPixel) 
        { 
            wine_tsx11_lock() 
            XSetFunction( gdi_display physDevDst->gc GXcopy ) 
            XCopyArea( gdi_display physDevSrc->drawable 
                       physDevDst->drawable physDevDst->gc 
                       physDevSrc->org.x + visRectSrc.left 
                       physDevSrc->org.y + visRectSrc.top 
                       width height 
                       physDevDst->org.x + visRectDst.left 
                       physDevDst->org.y + visRectDst.top ) 
            physDevDst->exposures++ 
            wine_tsx11_unlock() 
            return TRUE 
        } 
In each case it goes into this code. (XCopyArea is not a wine function) 
can you confirm? 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2002-07-18 22:56 ------- 
Yep it looks like that for me. I added a trace to check the parameters to 
XCopyArea and they look ok.  
    case SRCCOPY:  /* 0xcc */ 
        if (dcSrc->bitsPerPixel == dcDst->bitsPerPixel) 
        { 
    TRACE(    src_xy=%d%d size=%d%d dst_xy=%d%d\n 
                       physDevSrc->org.x + visRectSrc.left 
                       physDevSrc->org.y + visRectSrc.top 
                       width height 
                       physDevDst->org.x + visRectDst.left 
                       physDevDst->org.y + visRectDst.top ) 
 
I think what is happening is that the first bitblt is doing the scroll on an 
internal image. 
trace:bitblt:BitBlt hdcSrc=08dc 380 24 bpp->hdcDest=08dc 00 570x392x24 
rop=cc0020 
... 
trace:bitblt:BITBLT_InternalStretchBlt     src_xy=380 size=570392 dst_xy=00 
And then the second copies the entire image to the screen 
trace:bitblt:StretchBlt 08dc 00 608x392x24 -> 0894 00 608x392x24 rop=cc0020 
... 
trace:bitmap:X11DRV_DIB_SetImageBits 
XPutImage(440410690x80798180x80b3ec00000608436) 
... 
trace:bitblt:BITBLT_InternalStretchBlt     src_xy=00 size=608392 dst_xy=1622 
The dst_xy on this second one is offset to accomodate the frame (I think).

It's a timing problem it seems that when the source and destination are the 
same the screen is not updated properly before the next bitblt. I found this out 
by putting a FIXME in a for loop. I wanted to slow this down so I could see the 
problem as it progressed. What it did is clear the problem up. 
.... 
             physDevDst->exposures++

Duane have you tried Riven with either of my hacks and if so what do you think 
the problem is? Do you have any idea how to really fix this or should we leave 
it to one of the real wine guru's? 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2002-07-20 11:38 ------- 
I tried both. They partially fix it for me but not completely. I still get a 
single piece of the old view though it is a much smaller piece than before. It 
always happens if I first move forward and then turn sideways. And of course the 
other noticable thing is that the window does not slide (scroll) but instead 
just jumps from one view to the other. 
 
I notice that if I obscure part of the window with another window and then 
uncover it that it is repainted with the corruption still there. By the way I 
can always get the window to repaint correctly by sliding my mouse down into the 
area at the bottom where the books are kept. This might require the window focus 
to be set to focus follows mouse.  
 
I don't really have much of a feel for where the problem is. It appears to me 
that the bitblt commands have the correct parameters so like you I think this 
is some sort of timing problem. I have the Xlib reference book that explains the 
 XCopyArea command but it does not mention any gotchas if the two Drawables are 
the same. At the point I don't think I now enough to know how to attack it.  
 
 
------- Additional Comments From tony_lambregts  telusplanet.net 2002-07-24 
18:42 ------- 
I've had several days to think about this one and I have come up with the 
following conclusions 
 
1. The problem is not with the source and destination drawables being the same. 
This is pretty rock stable stuff that has been tested in X11 for years. Also 
while  Debuging Bug 792 I noticed that when scrolling in the file dialog that 
the source and destination were the same with no screen corruption. (I had put a 
fixme in the code to detect this.) So it isn't this. 
 
2. Timing is a factor because slowing down the execution of same drawables 
clears up the problem somewhat. 
 
3. If I move forward and then turn. at the begining of the trace there is this 
fixme. 
 
> fixme:bitblt:X11DRV_BitBlt potential optimization - client-side DIB copy 
 
This does not occure if I am turning around in circles. What brought my 
attention to this is that another program that has screen corruption (Bug 911) 
displays this fixme a lot. 
 
All that means is that I understand the problem a little better and have a hint 
of where to look next I suppose. My burning question at this point is what does 
the somewhat cryptic fixme really mean? 
 
 
------- Additional Comments From dclark  akamail.com  2002-07-25 13:00 ------- 
I think that slowing down redrawing is actually masking the problem rather than 
fixing it somewhat. I noticed that what Riven appears to do is measure how long 
it takes to perform a scroll and if it is too long Riven does fewer scrolls 
with larger chunks. I think this is what it is doing what it initially does 
several zero length scrolls. And specifically what makes it appear to work is 
that if scrolling takes really long it does the scroll in a single step. Since 
the painting of the fill image has always worked if the fill image is the 
entire thing it appears to work. 
 
So in short I am less confident now that it really is a timing issue.

Partial screen shot showing the problem

I'm running Iceweasel (Debian's version of Firefox) 38.5.0 with NoScript (and RequestPolicy). The winehq.org website has always worked up until this week when it was changed.

When JavaScript is disabled (which I have set as a default) the Bugzilla and Forums buttons are no longer accessible due to the search bar overlapping them.

Even without JavaScript it shouldn't be too hard to better position the search box (which is less valuable than the Bugzilla and Forums links it is hiding).

As a worst-case scenario if changing the positioning for some reason is not possible the z-index should likely be adjusted so the search goes underneath the buttons.",0,"0"

Tracing it reveals that it calls X11DRV_DescribePixelFormat MAX_PIXELFORMATS
times. So the physDev->visuals array gets filled with visuals from calls to
glXChooseVisual. Then it calls X11DRV_ChoosePixelFormat which uses
XGetVisualInfo and tries to match that with a value in the array which is where
it fails. It seems glXChooseVisual gives different values from XGetVisualInfo.

So the fix I tried was to use XGetVisualInfo in DescribePixelFormats as well.

"WINE-8226","DlgDirListComboBox does not fail properly on bad path spec argument","When a path spec is given that is not a directory and that does not contain any
* or ? then DlgDirListComboBox should fail and return False. Currently it can
return true. See http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms673323.aspx 

The problem for me occured in a win31 program extended to 32bit by watcom. The
program relies on a failure in the routine to open file from a fancy file
manager. The non failing prevented any file to be loaded. The call is with the
DDL_DIRECTORY|DDL_EXCLUSIVE flags.

An exemple:
 Let a directory c:\test contain many files including one subdirectory
(c:\test\testsub) then  a call to DlgDirListComboBox with path spec of
 c:\\test or c:\\test\\ or c:\\test\\*.* should all return true and
produce the same listing. But a call with c:\\test\\test.c should fail (wether
or not test.c exist because the file spec does not contain any * or ?. 
I checked this behavior under windows XP. Under the current wine I tested
(0.9.35 from fedora core 5 extras) this does not fail.

The actual problem is in the DIALOG_DlgDirListW function of
dlls/user32/dialog.c. I will attach a patch that produces the correct behavior
(compared to XP) and fixes my problem.


A related problem is that under windows (at least XP) when calling with 
only the DDL_DRIVES attribute produce the same result as calling with DDL_DRIVES
| DDL_EXCLUSIVE but this is not the case under wine. My program is filling a box
with files and drives but it is supposed to contain only drives. The same
happends when sending a message to the listbox directly so I attach a patch that
fixes the problem in the LISTBOX_Directory function of ddls/user32/listbox.c.",4322,"1"

There is also attached console diff between wine-1.1.15 and wine-1.1.16.


_Maybe_ because of this behavior people report it as progress bar issue - like a link between NFS Undercover and bug 12116 (it's not a dupe because wine 1.1.7 works for NFS Undercover unlike bug 12116 has still a problem with this version). I think this is bugzilla's lack that people don't have to leave a comment under a bug report when creating a link between application and bug report. At least i could see who made such link and ask him closer whether it's the same issue what app/game version etc...

Running the ddraw dsurface test seems to indicate that ddraw wants opengl enabled in the registry as the DirectDrawRenderer.  Then when enabling opengl a full-screen Seven Kingdoms draws the screen partially offscreen incorrectly.  When virtual desktop is enabled the game is visible correctly.

Well that's pretty clear!
Looking at http://www.winguides.com/registry/display.php/292/
I see that registry key is supposed to be under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
Adding it fixes things.  Here's what I see if I export the registry
and look for that key:

[HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-4\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
@=
ProxyEnable=dword:00000000

S-1-5-4 is the predefined Interactive SID so this
looks fine.  And sure enough the following patch makes
wineprefixcreate set the ProxyEnable flag on first init:

appeared in dlls/comctl32/listview.c 1.144. I have compared log files with -debugmsg

In 1.152 the execution path is LISTVIEW_SuperHitTestItem -> 
LISTVIEW_GetItemRect -> 
LISTVIEW_GetAllMeasure. The last one fails at 
  if (!(hdpaSubItems = (HDPA)DPA_GetPtr(infoPtr->hdpaItems nItem))) 
      return FALSE 
The pointer was never set because the window style contains LVS_OWNERDATA 
which causes set_main_item 
and set_sub_item to skip the calls to DPA_InsertPtr.

2. Run Cspro 4.0 program

3. Open file/application goto examples/capi (under cspro 4.0 subdir) open file capi.ent.

4. You will see that the icon in the tree window on the left side are black. Different when you see it in native windows.

Instead of writing such reports I could simply submit the fixed (great fix -
replacing one return value with another :) - still the specification exists -
it's better to conform it especially if it is not difficult :)) code but have
no idea how to do that.

Does someone maintains the quartz.dll sources? I suppose there are some parts of
