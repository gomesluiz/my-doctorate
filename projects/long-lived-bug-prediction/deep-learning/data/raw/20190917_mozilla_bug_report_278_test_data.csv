"CORE-180861","Form Submission should not know about PresContext","PresContext is 100% about content.  If there is something in PresContext that it
needs either that resource is in the wrong place or there is a substitute in

Three things I see in nsFormSubmission that use it:
- GetBidi() (Simon can you shed light here?  Is there a method in content
somewhere we can use?)
- GetLinkClickHandler is in PresContext but it's really nsWebShell so we can
get the DocShell and QI to nsILinkHandler.  Even *better* might be to put the
method on DocShell and call it something else since we're not really clicking a
link )
- GetEncoding() doesn't appear to need it anymore even though we pass it in. 
Yay :)

The nsHTMLFormElement methods just need it to call into nsFormSubmission.",1086,"1"

"SEAMONKEY-146411","3rd party LDAP Query may result in an invalid filter.","The Mozilla Address Book does not allow a blank search condition when attempting
to execute a query against an LDAP Directory Server. This is disallowed in the
StartSearch() method. But 3rd party products like OpenOffice.org integrate with
Mozilla using the DoQuery() method. Attempts to run a query using the
DoQuery()against a Mozilla LDAP  Directory requesting all the Mozilla attributes
will result in an invalid filter i.e. (|) getting generated. 

Investigating this behaviour further it is not sufficient to simply generate a
blank filter as this will default to the filter (objectclass=*) thereby
returning all entries from the LDAP Server regardless. Thus I have suggested
that we default the filter in this case to (mail=*) to return entries which are
relevant to the Address Book.",145,"0"

This is a failure of Firefox 1.5 to integrate itself with the OS X accessibility framework. It will break tools that depend on that framework in order to close Firefox windows. For instance it breaks Witch preference pane app which cannot close a firefox window.  It probably also breaks parts of the routine OS X accessibility support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and open a secondary window
2. Start the Apple Accessibility Inspector and inspect (lock on) the window's close button
3. Try to close the window by performing the AXPress action.

Actual Results:  
The window does not close.

Expected Results:  
The window should close.

Mozilla crashes if you attempt to read email when your profile is stored on a
file server and mozilla is also running on another machine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a profile on a networked file server (samba is best as you can see the
oplocaks and break the client)
2. Start Mozilla on one machine and read some email (S-IMAP in this case) it is
best if you have lots of folders/subfolders
3. Go to antother machine and start to read email there (mozilla -mail)
4. Crash

Actual Results:  Crash

Expected Results:  Mozilla should notice the oplocks and request a break or

1) chameleon is technically a development box.  The hardware isn't quite up to our production standards (lack of redundancy etc).  lists.spreadfirefox.com wound up running on it one of those times a long time ago when SpreadFirefox got hacked and it was the quickest place to move it at the time to get it up and running again the most quickly.  It was only supposed to be a temporary move and it never got moved elsewhere.  lists.spreadfirefox.com is the only production service running on this box.

2) We get a lot of spam on the abuse/postmaster/webmaster addresses on the spreadfirefox-related domain names because chameleon doesn't have very good spam filtering set up.  By moving these domains into the San Jose colo we can put them behind our primary mail relays which have very beefed up and actively-maintained spam and virus protection.

I don't know if there are any mailing lists on lists.spreadfirefox.com which are actively used so I'll need input from SpreadFirefox folks as to whether this needs to have a major outage window scheduled and announcements made or if I can just do it (mail will be queued and eventually deliver you'll basically just lose the Mailman web interface for the duration of the move).",25,"0"

If I understand it correctly StyleContextImpl's destructor

the following code.

  nsVoidArray *pResults = nsnull

RemoveElement is slow since it requires moving at average half the array in

15.1.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers

   Accept request-headers can reveal information about the user to all
   servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header in particular
   can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private
   nature because the understanding of particular languages is often
   strongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.

   An approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent
   to omit the sending of Accept-Language headers by default and to ask
   the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language headers to a
   server if it detects by looking for any Vary response-header fields
   generated by the server that such sending could improve the quality
   of service.

   Elaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request
   in particular if these include quality values can be used by servers
   as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user
   identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking
   and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server
   click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for
   many users not behind a proxy the network address of the host
   running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user
   identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance
   privacy user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept
   header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy
   measure proxies could filter the accept headers in relayed requests.
   General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header
   configurability SHOULD warn users about the loss of privacy which can
   be involved.

Modal dialogs spawned either by Firefox itself (such as SSL warnings) or by
JavaScript in web pages calling window.alert() are resizable by grabbing the
grippy (in Mac OS X) or the window edges (in Windows) and dragging.  These types
of dialog boxes should not be resizable but they are when
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable is set to true.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set security.warn_entering_secure to true
2. Set dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable to true
3. Open a new tab and go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org
4. Grab the bottom right corner of the security warning and attempt to resize it

Actual Results:  
The dialog box is able to be resized allowing you to make it really big or so
small that the OK button is no longer visible.

Expected Results:  
The dialog box should not be resizable regardless of the value of
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable.

I verified this bug in both Firefox and Seamonkey (both Classic and Modern) on
the trunk and the latest release versions (1.0.4 and 1.7.8 respectively) on
both Mac OS X and Windows.  This bug is more obvious on Mac OS X since it places
a grippy on the bottom right corner.  The dialogs are only resizable when
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable is set to true when it is false they
behave as they should.

The above steps reproduce this bug using a dialog box spawned by Firefox.  I
will attach a testcase which uses a JavaScript alert() windnow.

It expands by a few hundred megabytes every reload of test_seek.html. If you wait long enough (I assume) a garbage collection is done and the memory shrinks back down to a few hundred megabytes. When running this many times it's easy to expand the memory usage to over a gigabyte.

Usually the first run expands the memory usage to a few hundred magabytes but if I add a call to gc() at the end of _connectionClosed in httpd.js:719 memory always stays at around 9MB.

Note that test_seek is disabled on Windows because as it fails intermittently. This is because either necko or httpd.js can't handle suspending or resuming connections this is a separate issue and I'm looking into this. If test_seek.html appears to not terminate that's not related to this gc issue. If I set the media code to not try to suspend/resume connections this memory bloat still happens so that's not the cause.

This bug happens on at least Linux and Windows. You have to edit content/media/test/Makefile.in to enable test_seek.html on Windows if you want to test on Windows.

Perhaps this is invalid xhtml? IE 5.1 renders it completely (it's probably more
forgiving of bad html...)

I realise that it's ideal to promote corect html but could there be either

1. an option to revert to a more forgiving parser?
2. An option to generate a report of the parser's problems with the
   page to send back to the page's maintainers so they can correct
   their page. (This may be a big help in promoting correct html or

If on a web page there is a link with a URL which ends in a %-encoded character (but does not have any other escaped characters in the URL) and the page is displayed in UTF-8 the escaped character does not display in the status bar.

This doesn't affect functionality. If such a link is clicked Firefox will open the correctly escaped URL.

Everything works normally if either of the following is true:
* There are other escaped characters in the URL
* The page is displayed in any other encoding than UTF-8

The following may be true but none are necessary for reproducability:
* The page is actually encoded in UTF-8
* The server specifies UTF-8 in its headers
* UTF-8 is indicated in the HEAD block of the HTML file

For examples see the testcase HTML file.

1. Create an HTML file that contains a link to an address which ends in an escaped character.
2. Open the file in Firefox.
3. Make sure that Firefox displays the file in UTF-8 by selecting it in the Character Encoding menu.

"CORE-287624","round CSS border widths to nearest pixel","This is sort of a follup on the discussion in bug 173051 comment 17 through bug

I think we should round CSS border widths to the nearest device pixel in the
style system so that a given border width always rounds to the same size.  The
idea here is that we're solving this problem only for borders and not for
anything else -- since:
 1) for things like widths we want to ensure that 4 * 25% is 100% not a few
pixels less and
 2) we don't want consistency of heights for things handled by (1) since that
creates gaps like in bug 173051.

I think we should just have one check box that is something like:
_ Auto-fill passwords in web forms from the Keychain

> Jim: you want to do it? I was going to do it as parasympathetic nervous system
> therapy some night but it's fair game for anyone.

Sure --- I've promised strict mode and breakpad CFI at the moment but once those are in the clear this would be satisfying to do.  But it's filed as a bug now so anyone with gumption should grab it.

---

The bigger cleanup I kept refraining from doing in the upvar2 work to keep the
patch only insanely big instead of super-insanely big is to get rid of almost
all the parameters to jsparse.cpp functions making most of them methods of
JSCompiler. This should speed up the recursive-descent parser.

Beyond this there are some cleanups to jsscan.h to use C++ canonical style. But
again the JSCompiler wants at least some inline helpers to forward calls on
itself to its tokenStream member to save typing and shorten lines full of
redundancy in jsparse.cpp.

---

To say a bit more all the C static functions that have the JSParser signature:

typedef JSParseNode *
JSParser(JSContext *cx JSTokenStream *ts JSTreeContext *tc)

become JSCompiler methods taking zero args. Any cx uses become free and need to
rename to context -- or better we rename JSCompiler::context -> cx. Similarly
for ts -> &tokenStream mutatis mutandis. The tc param needs to be a top of
tree context stack pointer in JSCompiler but that's easy to do too.

Hope this helps and actually wins. Zero params has to make a difference on
code perf as well as size even if we sometimes load this->cx or whatever. But
a second opinion is welcome.",198,"0"

"CORE-527147","flat lambdas' parents differ between recording and trace","In the following code:

function g() {
    var x = 1
    var result = abcd.replace('b' function(){return x})
}
for (var i = 0 i < 100 ++i) {
    g()
}

The parent of |function(){return x}| differs between when we are interpreting/recording and executing on trace.  This can be observed by putting a breakpoint in jsstr.cpp FindReplaceLength on the line:

        *sp++ = OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(OBJ_GET_PARENT(cx lambda))

For the first three executions the parent is the global object for the fourth (on trace) the parent's class is a js_FunctionClass.  This causes a problem for tracing String.replace with a lambda since the trace type of a function differs from other objects.

The root of the discrepancy is in TraceRecorder::record_JSOP_LAMBDA_FC which effectively passes cx->fp->argv[-2] (the caller object) to js_AllocFlatClosure as the parent.  In the interpreter cx->fp->scopeChain is passed which is the global object for the above code.

I read that scopeChain can be lazily initialized so perhaps in some situations the caller object would in fact be the parent of a new lambda.  Is this possible?  If so then the generated code would be technically correct.

Even if this behavior is allowed though it would be nice (for avoiding an always-wasted recording) if the trace type of a function's parent did not change from record-time to trace execution-time.  Is there any simple efficient way to produce the same parent as when interpreting?",13,"0"

First the editing session is torn down on progress listener notifications and
fastback doesn't restore it.  

So with fastback if a site sets designMode on a document in a frame then the
frame is navigated to another URL and then the user goes back we will have:

1)  No editor hooked up in the frame.
2)  The document thinking an editor is hooked up.

At this point there is no way to reenable designMode for that document due to
item 2 even if the site uses the DOMPageRestore event to do so.

Second editing session teardown messes with things like image animation modes
script enabling etc etc on the document we're leaving.  If fastback also
messes with them we need to ensure the two run in the right order.

The damage area setup is wrong... the root of the problem IMO is the 'aRowSpan'

value (2) which is the result of:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/layout/tables/nsCellMap.cpp&rev=3.91&root=/cvsroot&mark=175217591760#1750


The problem also occurs for aRowSpanIsZero is false though -
see the second example.

The third is also a zero rowspan case although it triggers the assertion
at a different place nsTableFrame line 982:

1. ssl_DestroySID: In this function sid->references must be 0. Code
inspection shows that if |sid| is in the client cache the client

I replaced the check with an assertion.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 10.5 en-US rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6

Both Firefox and Camino are exposed to a font rendering integer overflow which exists independently in libpango and in Apple's CoreGraphics (ripc).

I have reported the bug upstream to Apple but they have no timeline to fix. (Yes this affects Safari too..)

The issue is in URL bar rendering.  If a very long document.location is set via javascript the integer overflow is reachable.  The files at the above location show this bug for each.  

The affected code in pango is in pango_glyph_string_set_size:
An overflow check when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation:
  string->glyphs = g_realloc (string->glyphs string->space * sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo))

I don't have a live exploit but this looks exploitable.  I have not yet gotten this reported upstream to libpango.  It is pending on their mailing list and I've received no response.

Because of their delay and Apple's delay I thought it would make the most sense to put a maximum limit on the document.location.

This will be referenced with advisory oCERT-2009-001.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a pango crasher in http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/
   E.g. http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_2.html
2. Crash.

Depending on how the overflow is handled you can get it to proceed without a crash.

(Note I've been tinkering with the crashers so there's nothing special about the different versions just a few tweaks.)
Actual Results:  
In camino it is often a NULL deref.  I can get a few other random stack-addresses visible but I haven't done a thorough analysis on the Apple libraries to know.

In ff pango exposes the num_glyphs after a successful underallocation.  If this is used for writing to the glyph array it will result in heap corruption.

Expected Results:  
Maximum URL length and/or integer overflow checks in libpango/ripc would stop this.

Please let me know if I can help coordinate anything.  I can be reached at my personal address: redpig@dataspill.org or at my oCERT addr: redpig@ocert.org.

I will be pursuing getting this upstream to pango but if you have any contacts that can help that'd be great.

"NSS-351767","pk12util cmd with -o and -W options crashes if exportfile is a directory","I was trying to create a .p12 file from a DBdir containing some certs and 
a private key.  The pk12util program I was using was a debug build built 
with Windows' debug RTL.  

I intended to create the p12 file with the name outdir/outfile.p12 but I 
mistyped the output filename omitting the /outfile.p12 leaving just 
the directory name.  I typed the command like this:

pk12util -n nickname -d DBdir -o outdir -W password -K password

where nickname DBdir and the two passwords were the correct/expected 
values but (again) outdir should have been outdir/outfile.p12.

pk12util output a single line error message then crashed.  
The error message was:

   pk12util: Initialization failed: outdir: Access Denied.

The code crashed in free().  
The stack was:

free(void * 0x00a61e60) line 926 + 11 bytes
PR_Free(void * 0x00a61e60) line 536 + 10 bytes
P12U_ExportPKCS12Object() line 712 + 13 bytes
main(int 0x0000000b char * * 0x00a61cd0) line 957 + 28 bytes

The lines of code where the crash occurred were:

    if (slotPw)
        PR_Free(slotPw->data)

    if (p12FilePw)
        PR_Free(p12FilePw->data)   <- crashed here

By trial and error I found that there are two crucial ingredients
to this crash which are:

a) the output filename must be a name that will result in a failure
b) the -W option and its argument must be present on the command line

The -K option and its argument are not required.  Without the -K option 
the user is prompted for the cert DB password before the crash.

The problem is a double-free.

In function P12U_GetP12FilePassword the value p12FilePw->data is assigned
to a variable named p0 which is then freed.  Then later the value of 
p12FilePw->data is freed again (at the line shown above) resulting in a
double-free.  

One possible (untested) solution might be this change in P12U_GetP12FilePassword:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a testcase.
2. Load another page in the same tab (e.g. your home page).
3. Press Back.

Result: Crash.


Stack from a nightly build:

0    PresShell::Freeze() + 420
1    PresShell::EnumeratePlugins(nsIDOMDocument* nsString const& void (*)(PresShell* nsIContent*)) + 236
2    PresShell::Thaw() + 132
3    nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory() + 2744
4    nsDocShell::CaptureState() + 668
5    PL_HandleEvent + 36
6    PL_ProcessPendingEvents + 128

Security-sensitive due to suspicious stack -- how does PresShell::Freeze end up on the top of the stack?  PresShell::EnumeratePlugins only appears to call GetElementsByTagName and (through the callback) StartPluginInstance.

In a debug build there are two assertion failures and the stack makes more sense: StartPluginInstance is at the top and the rest is the same.

###!!! ASSERTION: Object nodes must implement nsIObjectLoadingContent: 'objlc' file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp line 6234
Break: at file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp line 6234
###!!! ASSERTION: You can't dereference a NULL nsCOMPtr with operator->().: 'mRawPtr != 0' file ../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h line 849
Break: at file ../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h line 849


I think the problem is that EnumeratePlugins assumes that anything with the tagname object that QI's to nsIContent is safe to pass to its callback but StartPluginInstance assumes that its argument can QI's to nsIObjectLoadingContent.  Possible fixes:

(A) Make EnumeratePlugins use GetElementsByTagNameNS so it only sees  not all  elements.

(B) Make StartPluginInstance test for nsIObjectLoadingContent instead of asserting and then crashing.",8,"0"

1. Click on an *image* in right column say the firefox logo on black

Actual Results:  
There is just one item a decal.  The other categories also appear to have just
one product.  Quite disappointing.  


Expected Results:

Much later I clicked on another link and found that there are category listing
pages.  It turns out the problem is that in the right column the image links to
just the representative product pictured rather than to the expected list of
all the merchandise in the category named by the caption.

The right column has three images each with text underneath like labeled
icons.  It looks like 3 links not 6.

To avoid this confusion I suggest something like one of the following.  Either:

a. make it so clicking on the image above other merchandise links to the other
merchandise listing not just the one product (and ditto for other categories).  Or

b. add name of each featured product such as firefox decal under each image
so the image has its own caption and other merchandise category is clearly a
separate link.

Thawte Personal Freemail CA (serial number 0x00)
  Thawte Personal Freemail Issuing CA (serial number 0x0D)

No.  Once an NSPR thread is create joinable or unjoinable
there is no way to change that attribute.  I'm not sure
whether that's an oversight or a conscious design decision.

Pthreads has the operation you want: pthread_detach.

It's not hard to work around this limitation.  You'd create
all your threads PR_UNJOINABLE_THREAD.  Then you use a
thread count and a condition variable to synchronize with
them when the thread pool gets destroyed like this:

void WorkerThread(void *arg)
{
    ....
    // need to exit either voluntarily or because the
    // thread pool is being destroyed.
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)
    if (--thread_count == 0) {
        PR_NotifyCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
}

void TheThreadThatDestroysTheThreadPool(void *arg)
{
    ...
    // signals all the threads in the pool to exit
    ...
    // synchronize with them
    PR_Lock(thread_pool_lock)  // you might already be holding this
lock when you signal the threads to exit
    while (thread_count) {
        PR_WaitCondVar(all_threads_exited_cv PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT)
    }
    PR_Unlock(thread_pool_lock)
    ....
}

I will take a look at your new thread pool code tonight.

this problem. 

(BTW Doug If you look for the #if 0 in nsThread.cpp you'll see how I was

"CORE-139243","xpconnect should not do JS rooting for wrapped natives","bug 112152 talks about improving threadsafety for wrapped JS objects and getting
rid of JS rooting there. That is kind of tough. But we can pretty easily kill
the need to do refcount based calls to add and remove JS roots for wrapped
*natives*.

Instead of rooting we can do timely marking. This is better because it avoids
the lock overhead inherent in the JS rooting call. And it only happens at GC
time rather than each time the refcount on the wrapped natives makes a 1->2 or
2->1 transition.

We might see some measureable improvement in DOM manipulation benchmarks.

I'll attach a patch. I was working on dealing with bug 112152 too. So this
patch has some associated code that will be needed for that fix but which is
not *strictly* needed yet for this smaller fix. We should test this more and see

"BUGZILLA-13534","REMIND and LATER considered harmful.","I think that we should endeavour to remove REMIND and LATER from Bugzilla.  I
believe that they achieve more harm than good.

There are many disadvantages:

(a) They can easily not appear as queries.  After all they are _unresolved_.
(b) Effort to reopen resulting in comments/activity which clutter the bug
report.
(c) They are usually set by Netscape employees and hence imply Netscape's agenda
for what will go in.  Mozilla at least is a open project where anyone can
contribute.

So what's the alternative?  The obvious answer is the milestone.

Remind can already be handled by moving the bugs to a later milestone where
they need to get reevaluated.  Remind could even get turned into a bug flag
(see bug #11155).

For LATER there needs to be an No Target milestone.  This means that there is
currently no plan for implementation but it has been considered and hence
won't appear on groups' new bugs radar (ie having a blank milestone which might
be renamed to To Be Considered).

This would require a little modification of queries by Netscape employees to
exclude untargetted bug reports but they generally know how to use Bugzilla.
It is a lot more important that Bugzilla newbies can quickly find the issues
that do not have a target date and they should help out on and point (a) can
prevent this.  This combined with the introduction of assigning to
nobody@mozilla.org covers all the issues that I know of.

4MB jpeg or even a 40MB tiff and it is _not_ meant for viewing in a
browser. It is irritating to see mozilla flush almost everything else in 
its cache just to accommodate these beasts.

For symmetry there probably should also be a minimum size limit. I can 
imagine a user on a fast network retrieving small objects from a proxy

This is a really important feature for the proper implementation of RESTful architectures. I'm currently developing some RESTful prototypes and this feature is a must when dealing with aliasing of resources for instance in order to access resources by their ID or any other resource key field (as its unique name). The problem is that the http accept header in particular is very important to determine the proper format to de-reference to the resource to (as when using Ruby on Rails respond_to in order to determine the content-type to respond with).

"TOOLKIT-59687","Wallet should use displayble text to determine meaning of fields","THE WAY IT IS
-------------

Currently wallet tries to identify the meaning of a field by examining the value 
of the name attribute of the html input tag.  Sometime a website uses meaningful 
names (like zipcode) which makes this job simple.  But more often than not 
they use cryptic names (like 3.0.3.27.1.1.31.11.16.9.11 -- yes that's what is 
actually found on the apple site for the zipcode field).

So wallet uses a table that contains URL-specific mappings for determining the 
meaning of field names used on specific websites.  That table has to be quite 
large in order to support a large number of websites.  But no matter how large 
it is there will still be many websites that would not be supported.

Furthermore the table is hosted on a server and pinged at the beginning of 
every browser session to see if it has changed and needs to be redownloaded.  
This also requires a procedure for maintaining the table on the server and to 
date none has been put in place.  And it requires a lot of specialized code in 
the browser to do the downloading in background mode.

THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
--------------------

Rather than using the name attribute of the input tag wallet could use the 
displayable text preceding the input tag.  That's much more meaningful because 
it has to mean something to the user who is viewing it.  This would allow the 
entire mechanism for dealing involving URL-specific mappings to be discarded.  
Significant reduction in the amount of data actually stored in memory.  And no 
longer any need to do dynamic updates for a server site.",1135,"1"

I'm writing a Makefile for a sample javascript XPCOM module (that I don't want
to be installed by default) and finding that rules.mk has doesn't do a good job
of following the NO_DIST_INSTALL flag.  Here's my Makefile:

 DEPTH		= ../../../../..
 topsrcdir	= @top_srcdir@
 srcdir		= @srcdir@
 VPATH		= @srcdir@

 NO_INSTALL=true
 NO_DIST_INSTALL=true

 MODULE=GenericModule

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 XPIDLSRCS = \
	 nsGenericModule.idl \
	 $(NULL)

 EXTRA_COMPONENTS = \
	 nsGenericModule.js \
	$(NULL)

 include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk

And here's what I see when I make:

Looking in to this my best guess (I wish I could provide insight that was more certain than a guess...) is that following the call to .close() done in the pipe() method the errProcess stream gets cleaned up and its underlying file descriptor is destroyed thus this exception on this later (second) call to close().

If this call to errProcess.close() is commented out the same exception would occur but via the call to in.close() on line 744: (

  pipe(false in inProcess)
  in.close()

)

I suspect (though didn't actually encounter) this exception could also happen on line 769's call to outProcess.close().

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
IOException (Bad file descriptor) would occur around the 30th iteration of the loop. (Sometimes the exception would not occur until after several hundred iterations though.)

Since it states right in the submit anyway text that added comments will not be

previous person to edit the bug did was add a comment.  Since it displays the 
diff right on the page it's pretty obvious that was the only thing done and the 
collision detection should be smart enough to figure that out and not give the 
warning.

Conversly if the CURRENT edit is only adding a comment this should also 
automatically happen and not issue the warning.  (on the other hand it could be 
a duplicate post from the same browser which is probably also detectable and 
the warning should occur in this case).

The change of toolbar ID introduced with adding the Gloda search bar looses subsequently all customizations a user made before the transition. While this was motivated by promoting the new search function the user may want to retain his or her customizations of the main toolbar and place the search bar manually as desired into the existing set of buttons.

This can be roughly achieved by coping over the mail-bar2 definitions in localstore.rdf to the mail-bar3 definition (for all still valid items).

This is totally just a usability issue IMO so if you disagree then I guess feel free to mark as NOTABUG or whatever.

But when I have fewer than 7 tabs open Firefox draws an [x] button the active tab but not on the other tabs but if I mouseover another tab then the [x] button appears.  The problem is that when I'm moving my mouse to click on another tab I'm aiming for anywhere on the tab and suddenly I click the tab before I realize that an [x] button has appeared and I end up closing the tab instead of switching to it.

Personally I don't really like having an [x] on every tab.. but I feel like if you're going to do that it should always be there and not just on the mouseover.  I'd rather see it have an [x] on the active tab and allow you to right-click other tabs to close them without switching to them.  But that's just my opinion.

traced the problem to excessive throwing and catching
of exceptions.  

The Sun VM  handles exceptions much more efficiently
and thus does not suffer quite so much from exceptions
being thrown and caught in quick succession which is
why I didn't notice the issue before.

This is not a bug in rhino in fact the condition is
produced by a workaround for a Sun java bug

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4071593.html

See org.mozilla.javascript.NativeJavaMethod.retryIllegalAccessInvoke().

The pattern used here is the same as that shown in one of the
annotations of the currently open incarnation of the same bug

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4071957.html

This bug is not limited to inner classes though.  It
will also manifest itself why trying to invoke via reflection
a method on a pkg. private class offered via an Interface.

I place several references into the local scope created for
a request that are interface references to pkg. private classes
created via an Abstract Factory pattern.  By making these
classes public I avoided the need for the bug workaround and
improved performance significantly (a necessary compromise).

Perhaps some mention of this should be made in the FAQ since the
performance impact is significant (extremely so on the IBM VM).
The same problem would be seen when using Dynamic Proxies 
and features of the Collection classes.  If you read through
the associated bug reports I'm sure you will find more cases.

Here is the IMAP communication. The first time I check for mail (and the folders

As you can see the difference is that when it goes wrong Mozilla sends the command:

lsub  INBOX./*

instead of this command (which is sent the second time)

lsub  INBOX.*

The last is the correct command since that is what I have set Mozilla up to use
(and it works :)

Why does Mozilla insist on placing the / at the end when I check for messages
the first time even though it's not set under preferences?

This was not an issue with Mozilla 1.0 (there you just had to edit prefs.js

"TAMARIN_GRAVEYARD-418177","abc encoding enhancements","Created attachment 303967
encode abc to cpp fix abc-encode verbose mode

I'm attaching a patch which provides a couple of enhancements to the abc encoding of ESC:

* A new tool which encodes a .abc file as .cpp/.h files as currently done by the ASC compiler suitable for generating the shell's toplevel.cpp/toplevel.h and ScreamingMonkey's equivalent.

* Fixes to make 'abcencode.sh verbose filename' work - it breaks because it throws away the constant pool values on reading them so 'verbose' can't access the values.

This has been done by:

* Creating a new file abc-parse.es which includes the parsing logic from abc.es and also the 'constant pool' parsing code of abc-encode.es.  This was done after Lars suggested the refactoring of the parsing code into a new module and so the .cpp encoder can reuse this pool parsing.

* Modifying abc-encode.es to use the shared constant-pool parser particularly in verbose mode.

* New source file and shell script for the .cpp encoder other tweaks to shell files to reference the new abc-parser.

Note the new .cpp encoder appears to work well and the output matches that of asc when run against the 2 toplevel .abc files in the source distro.  The order of the constants in the .h file do not match though but this is not a problem.",4,"0"

After downloading mails some of them get directly sorted into specific mail folders e.g. all Bugzilla-mails into 'Bugzilla'-folder. This worked fine until today's trunk build. Now message filters need to get started manually (Run filters on folder).

1. Download mails with filter rule on it
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Mail remains in Inbox.

Expected Results:  
Mail should be moved automatically to the specified folder.

Anchors should not be empty.

Defining image width and height helps speed up rendering as the browser knows how much space to allocate a particular area (image placeholder) while parsing and rendering the page. Otherwise the browser has to wait until the graphic is loaded before it knows where to put anything below or to the right of the graphic. The browser may need to rearrange the page as the images are downloaded. When it does the visitor sees a reflow a shift in the page layout. It's generally widely acknowledged among expert web authors book authors that defining width and height attributes of image is the correct thing to do.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070408 Minefield/3.0a4pre

The attached sample page shows and hides a region by setting its CSS
display property to block or none. If the accessible tree is
traversed after a change from block to none Firefox under Linux
crashes. The attached javascript shell log shows the required steps.

The talkback report for this problem is 31019831.

On Windows with the exact same Minefield build (2007-04-08)
the problem does not occur in this simple case. I will attach a
comment for how to provoke a similar crash on Windows.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See the attached javascript shell log
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
The accessible tree should reflect the changes to the display
property and Firefox should not crash when the accessible tree is
traversed. 

Some information about the traversal of the accessibel tree:

The code used can be found in:

http://firemacs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/firefox/moz.js

The relevant functions are dumpAccessibleTree and
dumpAccessibleNode.

The first function will simply traverse the accessible tree
recursively calling the second fuction for each node.
dumpAccessibleNode will access finalRole name finalValue state extState and
description for each node. These accesses sometimes throw an
exception which does not make much sense to me. For provoking the
crash it is apparently important to actually access these node
properties i.e. if the line calling dumpAccessibleNode is commented
out in dumpAccessibleTre no crash occurs. In other words simply
walking the tree structure is not enough for a crash.",3,"0"

The most common actions I take in my browser are:

* search with google
* go to location bar type in an address or nickname
* paste in an address by middle-clicking on the window
* click on a link
* go back (especially when doing google searches)
* reload (especially for nicknamed or bookmarked pages)
* copy address and paste into another app

All of these should have keyboard shortcuts. And they do. 

But back and reload are very simple actions that should have single key shortcuts. 

Currently on Unix the shortcuts are awkward to find with the fingers: Alt-Left
and Ctrl-R. 

They should be the same as on Windows: Backspace and F5. If that's not possible
other keys should be found so that only a single easy-to-find-with-the-fingers
key needs to be pressed for these extremely common actions.

Thanks for your work on free software.

spreadsheet summarizing crashes

It's been theorized that we can reduce the security risk due to frame tree maintenance bugs by unconditionally -- even in release builds -- overwriting deallocated frame objects with a poison pattern that forms a pointer to inaccessible memory.  I've done some preliminary testing of this concept and it looks promising: of six crash-on-load test cases that I have five change from jump to an address that might be controllable by an attacker to data read from the poisoned address and the other one appears to not involve frame objects directly.

Attached will be:

1. A spreadsheet listing the small handful of current sg:crit bugs that contained test cases that actually crash a release-mode build of current trunk (where current means right before the focus patches landed -- specifically revision 1057ca8f2a91).  Each is annotated with the crash syndrome in unmodified trunk and with the patches that I'm proposing.

2. A tarball of all the test cases I'm using.

3. A tarball of the automation I'm using.

2. Two patches which together implement the poisoning.  They are feature complete with one critical exception: both Windows and Linux define certain regions of the address space to be permanently inaccessible but MacOS X does not.  On MacOS we need to instead mmap() a couple pages of memory mprotect() them PROT_NONE and use an address in the middle of that range (to catch both positive and negative offsets).  I would prefer if someone who actually has a Mac wrote the code for that.  (It would also be good if someone else carefully checked whether my understanding of the address space layout on Windows and Linux is accurate.  I'm cc:ing bsmedberg largely for that reason.)

5. A third patch which is *not* intended for inclusion but which you will need in order to reproduce my results.  It does two things: dissociates this experimental build from normal profiles and adds a special mode to nsSigHandlers.cpp in which we spawn a gdb process to generate stack traces for us rather than trying to do it ourselves this is available even in non-debug builds.  The automation is set up to use this special mode.

The Buypass Class 3 certificates are either issued to persons or enterprises. The certificates may be used for authentication purposes encryption/decryption and/or electronic signatures (non-repudiation). The certificates are part of an infrastructure provided by Buypass AS enabling electronic commerce in Norway. The certificates are used by many different service providers ranging from purely commercial companies to governmental and other public institutions including the health sector. 

Buypass Class 2 certificates are issued to persons or enterprises and have the same basic usage areas as Class 3 certificates. The Class 2 CP has however less strict requirements with respect to identification of the requesting party and thus have a somewhat lower quality than Class 3 certificates. 

We are currently ready to include SSL certificates including EV in our certificate portfolio as well. Extended Validation SSL certificates will be issued exclusively by Class 3 CA.

"CORE-474160","[regression] mozilla UI is no longer ISO8601-compatible","This bug is a regression from bug #441167.  Many parts of the user interface (for example Page Info --> General tab in SeaMonkey) now disregard the 24-hour setting for time as specified in the operating system settings making Mozilla no longer ISO8601-compatible.  Due to the changes in the patch that was committed it is no longer possible for the user to specify the date and time format that they want to use across the entire interface.

My proposed solution is to backout the patch from bug #441167 completely since if the user wants the interface to be in a certain language (including the date and time format) then they should select such a language in the preferences of the operating system.  Making it impossible for the user to make the selection in favour of supporting the full monty localisation of the application on wrongly configured operating systems is hardly acceptable and is a wrong approach in fixing bugs like 419220 (which by the way remains unfixed even with the introduction of this regression that were are now discussing).

"TESTOPIA-386325","Filtering by component can yield duplicate results","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: 1.2

If a test case is associated to more than one component it will be returned multiple times when filtering by more than one of those components. For instance assume we have three components (C1 C3 and C3). Now let's assume we have a test run that includes the following test cases with their associated components in brackets...

TC1 (C1)
TC2 (C1 and C2)
TC3 (C3)
TC4 (C2 and C3)

In the test run search we choose to filter by component and select both C1 and C2 meaning we want all test cases that are associated to C1 and/or C2. We would therefore expect to get the following list returned...

TC1
TC2
TC4

Instead we get the following...

TC1
TC2
TC2
TC4

The second result is duplicated because it is associated to both components that have been queried (likely a missing DISTINCT in the sql). The test case count at the bottom becomes inaccurate because counts them separately. In our previous example it would say that there are 4 test cases that match our filtering criteria in the current test run when in truth there are only three.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Associate five different components to a test case
2. Create a test run that includes this test case
3. In the test run view expand the Filter section
4. Select three of the five components associated to the TC in Step 1 and click the Filter button.
Actual Results:  

The same test case run is listed three times and the test case count at the bottom of the table says 3 test cases found when in truth there's only one.

Expected Results:  

The test case run is listed only once. The count at the bottom says 1 test case found.

"BUGZILLA-274365","More easy way to search Bugzilla - generic Product/Component and Resolution/Status for search by users","According to Product/Component restructure many duplicate bugs on same problem
but different product could be closed as DUP.
For example many of Thunderbird bugs could be closed as same problem as
mai&news bug because common Product=Core/Component=Mail&News:sub-component was
introduced.
However this has caused other duplicate bugs.
 Many users don't care CORE etc.
 Many users search Product=Thunderbird instead of Product=Core
 if he/she uses Thunderbird.
Bug 274237 is an examle.
> 274237 : If first line of msg is '--' entire message is detected as a sig and
quoting problems are introduced
Many DUPed bugs have similar symptom in summary and this bug could be easily
found as DUP by reporter himself by searching with summary=sig & -- 
if and only if Product=CORE is selected.

A way of generic search is required for non-developer users. 
Next is an example of categorization by bug reporter's point of view instead
developer's view.
 Product-Package-or-Unit:
   Mozilla Browser or Firefox Mail&News or Thunderbird
   Mozilla Composer or Standalone Composer and so on 
 Bug-Status:
   (a) Valid-open(Confirmed Not fixed yet)
   (b) Valid-open-or-DUP ((a) or FIXED-DUP)
   (c) Valid-open-or-DUP-or-fixed ((b) or FIXED-RESOLVED/VERIFIED recently)
   (d) May-valid-or-DUP-or-fixed
       ((c) or UNCONFIRMED or WONTFIX or INVALID recently)
 On search above is expanded to appropriate Product/Component or Relution/Status
 automatically.

Categrization in search is different in each search but predefined
categorization will be useful for initial bug search.
I think it will be a way to reduce duplicate bugs.
(I think (d) in above example is usually required)
It can be pre-defined set of saved search initially and is sufficient for
Browser(Firefox and Mozilla) and Mail(Thundeird and Mozilla) only initially
although HTML/JavaScript/ServerSideScript is better as generic search in future. 

In addition to above pre-defined bug-list heading should be more kind to users.
Since default header is designed for program owner is it not approprite for
initial duplicated bug search(owner name is not needed for user).
My customization example is as follows 
  IDLast Changed DateResolutionStatusCompSummary(full)
Although headers can be easily customized initial setting for non-developer is
preferable because developers have sufficient knowledge on bugzilla but usual
users are usually not and many of bugzilla.mozilla.org users are usual users
bug reporters.

Third some limitation on number of search result is required.
If number of hits is very large it takes very long time in both searching and
listing of results.
This causes frustration of uers. Result listing of 10000 is meaningless for users.
Reporting hit count only is better if number of hits exceeds a limit.
This will also reduce server's workload.",88,"0"

"NSS-233586","EDIPartyName should be CONSTRUCTED (probably X400AddressName also)","User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U SunOS sun4u en-US rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20030711

CERT_DecodeGeneralName fails if generalName is EDIPartyName.
Specifically the first call to sec_asn1d_confirm_identifier() fails
because the template has set expect_tag_modifiers to 0x80 while the
found_tag_modifiers are 0xa0.

Within the context of GeneralName EDIPartyName is an implicitly tagged
SEQUENCE. ASN.1 dictates that implicitly tagged types are primitive or
constructed depending on the underlying type. Since the underlying type
is SEQUENCE in this case the implictly tagged type should be constructed.

I think CERT_EDIPartyNameTemplate needs to have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED included
in its kind so that it expects 0xa0 and not 0x80 for tag_modifiers.
[and it continues to expect 0x05 as the tag_number of course]

I have not tried the X400Address but I suspect it has exactly the same
issue since it is also an implicitly tagged SEQUENCE and its template
does not have SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED as part of its kind.

I took a look at:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.3/SecurityNssAsn1-11/nssDER/Source/nameTemplates.cpp
and it has both EDIPartyName and X400Address marked as CONSTRUCTED.

I also looked at the test certs that can be gotten to from
http://csrc.nist.gov/pki/testing/x509paths.html
and I couldn't see any obvious test cases which used EDIPartyName
or X400Address.

When trying to use gtkmozembed throught the python bindings I found the
following problem:

In a few of the signals strings are used but marked as GTK_TYPE_POINTER
So when pygtk tries to demarshal them it thinks it's a bogus pointer object
instead of a string.

The solution is to mark all strings as GTK_TYPE_STRING instead.

The problem is that all the relative widths that are font based are
relative the height not the width:

my notes about what I did and what happened

So I pushed a bunch of changesets to the try server (push-to-try) to figure out which of the 10 changesets that I landed caused the startup test to fail on Mac.  I got 11 builds as described in bug 479260 and 8 talos runs happened that were labeled with the changesets that supposedly generated the builds they were testing.

However the results don't actually make sense so I think it's pretty clear that the label that shows up in the tinderbox waterfall showing which try server build was tested isn't actually the build that was tested.

Attached is the text file describing what I did.  I pushed 10 changesets one-at-a-time and then later pushed 3 changesets (all at once) that were equivalent (but with different dates) to the first three of the 10.  The pattern of orange and green didn't make sense although it could have indicated that the problem causing the startup failure was random but happened most of the time.  (However I have at least 9 runs on the mozilla-central tinderbox saying it happens every time or pretty close to that.)

So on the assumption that it was random but happened most of the time I relanded the changes that were on later than the first orange plus two uninitialized variable fixes that wouldn't cause orange and the mozilla-central tinderbox turned orange again.

(Sorry if that's not clear I can explain in more detail if you really need it.)

"RELEASE_ENGINEERING-469680","Provide directory link immediately on try submission","There's a very common try server use case that goes:

 - Add a patch to a bug
 - Try server that patch for people to test
 - Once the builds are done comment on the bug with the directory link so that people can fetch that build

What complicates this process is that while the try server is churning on the patch the builds directory ( https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/?C=MO=D ) shows no sign of it.  This means that the submitter has to poll from time to time seeing if there's a directory so that they can comment in the bug and close the loop.  And typically as soon as (say) the Mac build is done they'll scoop up the directory post it in the bug and say something like Builds still underway but they should appear here...  Bugs like bug 430942 are all about this use case.

I suspect that we can know the directory they will land in the second they are submitted.  I propose one of two things:

1) Create the directory immediately.  Yes it may be empty for a while and in the case of a failed build might be permanently empty but so what?  They're cheap they're cleaned up in 30 days and it gives us a live link target right away.

2) Don't change the build process at all but at least anticipate what the directory WILL be ( timestamp-user@host-buildid ) and output that as a linky on the success page/tinderbox waterfall so that people have a link (albeit not valid yet).

I don't know quite enough about buildbot to make the first thing go but with pointers to the appropriate source I could try to put a patch together.",641,"1"

When I drag a file from an FTP site (that I have read/write access to) into 
Mozilla Firefox it deletes it from the FTP without asking!!!  This has 
happened with any version of Firefox I have used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into an FTP site using either Windows Explorer or Internet Explorer
2. Find a file that you wish to view in Firefox
3. Drag the file from the Explorer window into Firefox
4. Watch your file disappear from Explorer!
5. Refresh the Explorer window and the file is not there.  It has been deleted 
off the server.

Actual Results:  
The file was deleted off the FTP

Expected Results:

IE and drag a file from an FTP into it it loads the page from the FTP.  This 
is what Firefox should do too.  I have no problem logging in a second time to

Build Identifier: 

MenuHelpersX::CreateTruncatedCocoaLabel (in widget/src/cocoa/nsMenuX.mm) will truncate the label text of menus and menuitems if they are above a certain length. They do this via the TruncateThemeText carbon call (deprecated as of OS X 10.5). Apart from being deprecated it appears that this call is unnecessary.

In a xulrunner build I have locally -- the actual app has some menu items with fairly long names especially in some locales -- I've commented out the call to ::TruncateThemeText and cranked the resolution down to see what happens. It seems that Cocoa is smart enough to shorten menuitem labels and menu labels automatically -- via an ellipsis at the end of the label or mid-label -- if working with a screen resolution too small to fit everything in appropriately. No explicit calls to ::TruncateThemeText are necessary and in fact for me they're harmful.

So it seems like CreateTruncatedCocoaLabel could be eliminated and calls made to it replaced with a call that converts the nsString label to an NSString* directly. I don't know enough about upstream dev practices to suggest a patch myself though.

Thanks!

"FIREFOX_BUILD_SYSTEM-362392","mddepend.pl stat() optimizations","A few things can be done to reduce the number of |stat()| calls performed by mddepend.pl:

1) The loop which iterates over dependencies (see lines 91-102 in the sample URL) could be broken into two passes. The first pass only checks the %alldeps cache for each dependency and saves each dep that isn't in the cache. The second pass only runs if necessary and actually stats the deps that were skipped during the first pass.

2) The cache-checking code doesn't distinguish between deps that haven't been stat'ed and aren't in the cache and deps that don't exist and are in the cache with a time of undef. As a result a dep that doesn't exist is rechecked for each target that depends on it.

3) %alldeps is initialize incorrectly. The {} on line 54 is a hash reference so %alldeps ends up with a bogus target named HASH(0xsomething). This causes an extra pass through the target loop. Line 54 should probably just be my %alldeps

In my simple tests these changes reduce the number of stat calls by roughly 25%. Most of the benefit is from #1. If nobody else jumps on this I'll submit a patch this weekend.",440,"1"

1) There may be builds that do not want to include the building of
accessibility. For instance in a PDA-type device where there is no MSAA

those pieces of the development toolkit. Not to mention we are trying to keep

I have a web page I'm trying to view which consists of some invalid HTML.  It is basically a series of several hundred tables with each table containing a couple of other tables.  Some of the  tags are not terminated with a .  This means that eventually the DOM reaches 128 nodes deep (rather than 10-12 as was intended by whoever wrote the code to view the page).  It turns out that Firefox is pruning the DOM at a depth of 128.  The page displays fine in Konqueror and IE but is pruned on Firefox.

This is not likely to be the best way to handle this situation even though I realize this was probably intentional to avoid layouts bringing the browser to its knees.

Perhaps the max number of levels should be raised to 1024 or lifted entirely?  Or child nodes added as siblings beyond a certain depth so that at least the info doesn't actually disappear?  (I thought it was a missing record problem then a server problem then a browser bug then I realized what was actually going on...)

it might be necko silently failing to establish the connection or us dropping

Below `Agencia' and `Conta' on the left of the web page there's a Java applet
in which you're supposed to enter your password.  No matter what I enter there
after I click on the `entra' button I get back the same web page now with an
error message in red below the applet saying `Atenção: senha: conteúdo nulo'
(meaning Attention: password: null contents).

The same web page works fine on Netscape 4.79-1 on the same machine and OS.  It
fails similarly with Mozilla 0.9.9 included in Red Hat Linux skipjack-beta2
using Sun JRE 1.4.0 as the Java plug-in and with Mozilla 0.9.9 on MS-Windows 2000.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.browse to that web page
2.enter `1-9' for both `Agência' and `Conta' (otherwise the check-digit
verification will fail before the password is tested)
3.enter anything at all as the `Senha de auto-atendimento' in the Java applet
4.click on `entra'

Actual Results:  An error message saying the password as blank is displayed:

Atenção:

Expected Results:  If an incorrect password with 8 digits or longer is
entered you should get to a web page saying `DADOS NAO CONFEREM'.  If a
non-blank password that is too short is entered you'll remain in the same web
page with a message saying the password must have at least 8 characters:
Atenção:

If the correct password were entered you'd gain access to the account but

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.9a5pre) Gecko/20070506 SeaMonkey/1.5a

When pasting an image from the system clipboard to a Composer window Composer correctly creates a new image file on disk for this.

However it saves by default in JPEG and with very low quality compression (esp. for line graphic images like charts) causing bad visual artifacts and making small text in the image impossible to see.

This is reproducible and happens every time regardless of what kind of an image is in the clipboard to be copied.

Workaround is to save each image manually to a file OUTSIDE Composer and then manually link each image from within composer (from the files created).

However this is very tedious and time-consuming when editing existing web pages and copying multiple images from other applications.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy an image of your choice to clipboard pref. of original quality (no previous compression) one with line graphics and some text in the image. A time series chart with a title and X & Y axis labels is a a good example
2. Paste the image from clipboard to a composer Edit window (Ctrl+V).

Actual Results:  
Compare the original image (clipboard) vs the one now in the Composer window. See how badly the jpeg compression destroys the image contents in the Compoöser copy.

Expected Results:  
1. User selectable Image format (JPEG/JFIFF PNG GIF etc) format and compression ratio (for JPEG and PNG at least) in the preferences.

2. Additionally by default the compression ratio for jpeg (if jpeg format is default) should be lower resulting in less image artifacts in the copy/pasted images.",397,"1"

3. Launch Accerciser and locate a true label (e.g. the blocking1.8.1.8 label).  Select this label within Accerciser.

4. In Accerciser's iPython Console type the following:

  text = acc.queryText()

5. Alt Tab back to Minefield.  The caret should be within the label.  Arrow right or left to verify this.

6. Press Tab to move to the next focusable object

Expected results:  After step 5 focus would be removed from the location chosen in step 2.  After step 6 focus would move to the item that follows the label (e.g. the blocking1.8.1.8 combo box)

"CORE-268535","crashes where rt->gcFreeList turns into a small int after last-ditch GCs","I created a multithreaded test app in an attempt reproduce atom related crashes
we've been seeing. It didn't expose crashes with the exact same stacks. But it
does show some interesting problems.

I'll attach the source. I don't have a generic Makefile for it. But it is only
one .c file that builds as a standalone executable that uses only spidermonkey
and nspr. It creates one JSRuntime and a bunch of threads that each create a
JSContext and loop through the evaluation of scripts each containing a bunch of
randomly generated identifiers (all within JS requests).

The scripts currently look like...

function FOO {var FOO_1 var FOO_2}
function BAR {var BAR_1 var BAR_2}
FOO()
BAR()

Of course it creates a ton of those lines. And the identifier lengths are also
randomized.

I believe that my test code represents a valid use of the api and that all
scripts are themselves valid.

I've seen this test fail in a few ways:

1) Crash in js_AllocGCThing (jsgc.c:479) where rt->gcFreeList is equal to 1 (but
should be a valid pointer or NULL). This *seems* to happen when one or more
other threads are doing last ditch GCs. I've seen this a number of times.

2) A ReferenceError reported by the error reporter (e.g. ReferenceError: FOO
is not defined). The identifier in question in these cases in shown as text by
the error reporter. It is always actually a valid identifier that is in the
script (the test code guarantees that - and I've  validated the script contents
in some of these cases to be sure). This error indicates that the interpreter
failed to find an atom at runtime that it absolutely should have found. I've
seen this a bunch of times. This *might* indicate a corrupted atom.

3) A crash in QuoteString (jsopcode.c:402) called by
js_AtomToPrintableString in the case where the interpreter is trying to build
the string to report a ReferenceError (as above). This looks like a case where
the atom that the interpreter is trying to lookup is not only not found as a
property but that the atom used for the search actually represents a bogus
JSString while the interpreter is still trying to use it. I've seen this once so
far.

There are a bunch of #defines at the top for thread counts GC frequency
identifier length etc. I've been twiddling this stuff a lot and seeing
different effects. This test is just a quick hack at this point.

I'm hopeful that this will help in figuring out problems we've been seeing. And
that this might be a starting point for a multithreaded smoketest (at least).",82,"0"

CVS interactions in MozillaBuild are easier if you run ssh-agent and then ssh-add your key to it but it would be even easier if ssh-agent was already running and you only had to run ssh-add.  One way to do this is to start ssh-agent before rxvt and then start rxvt as a client of ssh-agent.

I've been running MozillaBuild like this for a while now and I can't detect any issues with it.  Here's a patch to the start-msvc*.bat files that implements it.",1,"0"

All functionality works in Windows Linux and Mac.

However we would like to have some patches checked into CVS. They are merely
linguistic fixes - spelling and terminological consistency. The number of files
will have been kept to an absolute minimum. They have been tested by us and
passed all our checks fine.

We have an improved bookmarks.html with links to instead to Welsh newsfeeds from

Hi guys

Not sure if it's because of JavaScript or something else but the map does
properly show up on Internet Explorer so I would assume that it should show up
with mozilla right?

It looks like there is much javascript and it could also be that the server
detects a non IE browser and doesn't send the same data. I didn't check that
since I don't have the tools to do it.

The page is in French so if you have some French people working on your team

"NSPR-34920","Provide an implementation of PR_AcceptRead PR_TransmitFile and PR_SendFile that can be used by I/O layer implementers","NSPR defines three I/O methods PR_AcceptRead
PR_TransmitFile and PR_SendFile that are intended
to exploit fast system calls on some platforms
for example the AcceptEx and TransmitFile functions
on Windows NT.  However only the bottom layer (i.e.
the NSPR layer) can take advantage of these fast
system calls all the upper layers need to emulate
these functions.  It turns out that the emulation of
these functions is the same for most upper I/O layers:
- PR_AcceptRead: PR_Accept followed by PR_Recv.
- PR_TransmitFile and PR_SendFile: memory-map the
  file then write the memory-mapped region to the
  socket.

Instead of having each I/O layer emulate these I/O
methods NSPR should provide the common emulated
implementation of these I/O methods which the I/O
layer implementers can just plug into the PRIOMethods
table of their layer.

Because normal NSPR clients don't call these
emulated functions directly these emulated functions
should be exported as private functions and declared

When a menu item's direction is changed (LTR->RTL or vice-versa) the menu item's layout does not change (i.e. the .menu-left element still remains laid out on the left instead of moving to the right).

* If a menu has not been opened prior to the direction change there is no problem.  This is only a problem if the menu item has already been laid out prior to the change.

* In some cases such as the opening of a submenu the layout gets updated and the problem corrects itself for that particular item.",997,"1"

If this is done from a locally-loaded file (file: URL) it will work the first time and each time you shift-reload.

most localizers of mozilla agree i believe that the size of this file poses a
problem:
1. any change in the file renders the entire file as invalid for inclusion in
the next language pack until the changes are updated in the translation
leaving it with no translated help at all for mail. because of the large amounts
of text in the help system many language packs don't include a complete
translation of the help. if this file was split in 3-4 parts at least some of
them could be entered to the pack if the localizer didn't make it to update the
change in time for the release or didn't translate the whole file for some
other reason.
2. load time: on my AMD 600MHz WinXP with 256MB 100MHz SDRAM it takes this
file 2-3 seconds to load. i think this is unacceptable for a local file.

"SEAMONKEY-158920","build fails if cygwin mount prefix is not /cygdrive","I thought that we had fixed this at one point but it seems to have been
resurrected with the fix of bug 141834.  Cygwin uses /cygdrive/X/foo/bar to
denote the path to files on drive X if X is a cyg-mounted drive.  If the drive
is unmounted cygwin uses /X/foo/bar/.  Both conventions already screw up
non-cygwin programs but this is doubly annoying.  While both are easy enough to
check for via sed the first has far less of a chance of hitting a false positive.  

Using `cygpath -w` to translate either type of path into a regular dos path
seems to work.  However we do not use cygpath in the cygwin-wrapper script
since cygpath only works on a single argument not a list of arguments.  Instead
we assume that /cygdrive/ is used which breaks when the drive isn't cyg-mounted.

Potential solutions:
1) Start using cygpath in the wrapper script.  This is nasty as it means
invoking a separate process for *each* argument passed through the script.

2) Skip the wrapper script altogether.  In the main build we use the script as
little as possible.  It's still used for a handful of things though namely
running rc perl & nsinstall.  nsinstall is the main sore spot as it can accept
a variable number of filename args which each would need to be checked. NSPR &
LDAP use the wrapper pretty much everywhere.

3) Hack cygpath to accept multiple args so that we could use cygpath in the
wrapper in lieu of sed.  This means yet another entry from wintools or hoping
that cygnus will accept the changes and bump the minimum rev of the cygwin tools
required.",254,"0"
"OTHER_APPLICATIONS-315913","Replace RDF userlist with direct nsITreeView implementation","This is mainly a personal rant because I've only just written the patch so I haven't had time to profile it properly but I get the feeling that Chatzilla spends too much time sorting the nick list. This is particularly evident when an op pings out what tends to happen is that you get join auto-op part and nick changes in quick succession which seems to kill my CPU.

The main thrust of my proposal is changing the tree from a content view to a builder view achieved by setting flags=dont-build-content on the tree. This already allows us to automatically sort when switching channel or when new nicks join a channel. The sort order is initialized once and then the tree maintains its sort although this can of course be toggled. Nick (and op changes in sort by op mode) are handled by removing and reinserting the nick.

Calls to updateUserList are therefore removed in setCurrentObject my_cjoin my_cmode and my_cnick although in the latter two cases calls to _removeUserFromGraph and _addUserToGraph are used to maintain the nick list.

I changed setListMode to clear the tree cache directly it appeared to be relying on some unknown side effect for its attribute change to take effect.

The only other change necessary in the current code was the code that extracts the nick from a given tree row as the builder view does not permit arbitrary attributes I had to extract the unicode name from the RDF data source. However the reverse operation of obtaining the tree row from a nick is simplified to tree.builderView.getIndexOfResource(nick.getGraphResource()).

I'm not sure what style is preferred so I tested for nsITreeColumn in my new sortUserList() method although I have only tested it on 1.8+ so far.",758,"1"

Cannot open Firefox after downloading it. Removed and re-downloaded three times
and tried to open different ways (icon Windows Explorer Programs) but did not
open. I get the hourglass momentarily but it won't open.

I removed SP2 and Firefox opened/worked fine. Contacted Microsoft about SP2 and
they said to contact you.

This appears to be similar to Bug 273098 but when I went to link:
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225894#c32) with possible fix it
referred to Monzilla and Shockwave. But according to Microsoft their impression
is a conflict which seems to me to be more basic than some unique fix on my
computer. This seems to me to be a fundamental problem warranting a fix in your
program? (Besides to be honest such a fix - which is only a 'try this?' may be
beyond my computer skills as it seemed complicated and I am afraid may mess up
my computer with no assurances it will work.) 

Is there a (simpler) fix known to work you can provide me with or is there a
fundamental fix in the program that you need to do?

Thanks.

"THUNDERBIRD-474701","gloda global search on toolbar folder display refactoring mega-bug","Falling out of bug 452281.  This will add a new search entry in the the default mail toolbar intended to provide a better search experience than the existing quick search.

The existing quick search could just be reused however it will be easier to add new search entry code specific to the behaviour we want.  Also this will leave the old quick search entry untouched such that people could bring it back.

---

With the removal of several buttons from the default mail toolbar ( bug 474523 ) the new search entry should take up a larger amount of horizontal space.  Likely twice the size of the current quick search entry.  It's placement can be the same as the quick search entry.  The emptytext should describe what the search entry is for.

On the right hand side we should be showing a search icon similar to what firefox uses for it's search input entry.

$emptytext = Search messages ( + keyboard_ accelerator + )

  [ $emptytext                                # ]

When a person enters some search text the search icon should change to be a |> go arrow button that is clickable to start the search this button can be triggered from pressing enter as well.

When a search is started from the main mail tab it will always open a new tab.  This the search entry should always be empty from the main tab.  When in a search results tab changing the search input and searching again does not open the results in a new tab.

"NSS-70992","nss 3.2 will not build on BSD/OS 4.2","Here's a set of patches that allows the NSS 3.2 release to be compiled
on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

"SEAMONKEY-92947","Better feedback when components of a page do not download","I was reading Sun's report on GNOME usability specifically this page
 and
found that after a few minutes some of the graphics had not been downloaded.
This problem also affects other pages where downloads of large amounts of
graphics can lead to timing out of page element downloads.

The only way I knew the download had effectively stopped was by looking at my
modem lights. Several years experience of the Internet has taught me that if
after two or three minutes of inactivity the action on a computer is likely to
have been aborted even if the computer has not told me. We need to tell the
user that this is the case in Mozilla.

The exact circumstances:

  The user has begun downloading a web page that included external elements
  commonly graphics. Some pages are slow to download for a variety of reasons
  and some fail to load completely.
What the user thinks:

  The user may have begun reading the page's content or interacting with it.
  Perhaps there are no immediate signs that the web browser has not completed
  it's downloading process or perhaps an error has occured which has failed to
  inform the user or not triggered an appropriate event in the software. Either
  way the user is either aware of the problem or not. In both cases the user
  has had no direct feedback from Mozilla.
What needs to happen:

  Mozilla needs to inform the user as to exactly what it's doing and if it has
reached a conclusion tell the user. In this case Mozilla has completed
downloading x/y components on the page (a simple counting process that isn't
displayed) and it is unknown what it is attempting to do now. If the network
connection for the remaining components has timed out or concluded in an error
(which is apparently the case) then the status bar should notify the user
appropriately. A suggestion is made below:

    Document: Done (x.xxx secs) - page could not be fully downloaded

  This tells the user that the document was rendered as best as could be
  acheived but that parts of the page were not successfully downloaded. Once
  this or other appropriate message has been displayed the throbber should 
  terminte animation the stop button should deactivate and the reload button
  should be re-activatable.

This bug should only cover the case whereby a page could be displayed but not
fully downloaded. Feedback given when a page tries to execute instructions in a
script and is in error are similar but should be covered in a seperate bug.

permanent cert even though keepCerts = PR_TRUE was passed in).

I believe the correct behavior is to return SECFailure in this case. However
there is some added complexity because the function can import more than one
cert. So do we report an error if any cert failed to install in the chain ?

At the very least when there is a single cert imported as in this case there
is no ambiguity we should report the correct status.",559,"1"

"CORE-386265","Using double-hashing for atoms.","During the browser startup until the default page is shown the JS engine allocates about 15000 atoms for strings. Running GMail brings that number to 26000.

Currently each atom means an extra malloc call since the engine uses chained hash table and represents atoms as hash table entries.

It would be nice to avoid these 15K malloc calls and switch the table to double hashing which is also more cache friendly.

The basic idea is to use jsval itself as a property id with string and double properties interned through the hashing.

The nontrivial part of this schema is how to deal with hidden properties. Since hidden properties are strings a possible solution for the problem is to tag them as booleans with an added benefit of very simple conversion between hidden and normal properties.",44,"0"

The problem is DBM needs to decrypt that data and reencrypt it to preserve it's date interface. That means for dbm to be FIPS the legacy dbm code needs to be included in the FIPS boundary.

To date we believe the only thing that needs to happen to make this work is to include a .chk file and verify the dbm .so file when in FIPS mode.

More research info it is not the document reference not working the problem 
is the returned popup window reference. Another weird thing is that if you do a 
reload (without closing the popup window) it will work. 

So my doubt is that at the moment window.open() returns it is still in the 
middle of creating the docshell and hense the window reference is not valid.

I am pretty sure we don't have this problem before (but not sure how long ago 
at that time popup window did not render about:blank initially). I used to test 
stuff like 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
and it used to work. It doesn't anymore.



------- Additional Comments From Adam Lock 2001-06-26 14:14 -------

Eddie window methods should work immediately but the window.document
property won't work until the document viewer has been created and associated
with the window. And the document viewer won't be created until the uriloader
tells the docshell's content listener that there is some content to render. This
minor gap between the window opening and the document viewer being present.

Perhaps we could make process atomic for about:blank or wait in window.open
for the first content to arrive before returning? Ideas?



------- Additional Comments From Eddie Xu 2001-06-26 14:58 -------

The two lines 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
is the exact codes I tested and it does not work. 

Unfortunately I can not block inside 
nsIEmbeddingSiteWindow::CreateBrowserWindow and peek for document viewer 
because it will never be created before I return from CreateBrowserWindow.



------- Additional Comments From Rick Potts 2001-06-27 01:07 -------

hey Eddie
I've spent some time tracing through both your cases (popup.document and
popup.resizeTo) and it turns out that they are related :-)

In the popup.document case it is just as Adam described - no document is
available...  Because nothing has loaded yet...

In the popup.resizeTo case things are a bit more funny :-)  It is basically
failing for the same reason - no document.  However in this situation it is
the Security Manager that is causing the failure...  Basically it is trying to
verify that you have the right to call resizeTo(...).  Unfortunately since no
document is available it cannot locate a principal...  This causes it to
silently fail :-(.

The funny part is that there is only a small window of time when you *are*
allowed to call resizeTo...  It will only succeed if it is called after
about:blank has loaded but before http://www.yahoo.com :-)  This is due to
security restrictions...

The bottom line is that when ever you create a new browser window you need to
create a nested message pump and block until the initial document (probably
about:blank) has been loaded into the webBrowser...

You can take a look at how mozilla does it at:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/appshell/src/nsXULWindow.cpp#1291

As you also noticed mfcEmbed does not do the right thing either when creating
new windows (or with modality in general)...

I'll see if we can fix up mfcEbbed to do the right thing as a simpler example :-)

Thanks Adam. 4517 does fix the painting problem but not the DOM. In your test 
case (the one with setTimeout(splurge() 3000)) if we change window.open
(about:blank) to window.open() like most site does your example won't work 
either. So this is what I am going to try on the embedding side:

After a popup window is created I am going to explicitly load about:blank and 
do a message pump and wait for the first OnStateChange(NETWORK DONE) to come 
in the new window before I return from CreateBrowserWindow. Sounds like a 
right direction to go?

<<Hi Eddie

The loading about:blank thing was a workaround while we sorted painting 
problems in new windows for bugscape 4517. This now appears to be fixed so I 
don't believe you need to do it anymore.

Eddie it may be possible to put some code into docshell that ensures that
about: protocols are loaded synchronously. I have made an initial attempt to do
this which does appear to work but it crashes almost immediatly after in the parser.

I'll attach a patch of my change in the hope that someone might be able to shed
light on the reason for the crash. To me it looks like the http channel is
sending data after I have already received the network stop notification via the
docshell's web progress listener.

hey Eddie
I ran into the same problem when I tried to add a sub-message-pump into mfcEmbed :-(

It turns out that before entering the nested event loop a new nsIEventQueue must
also be pushed !!!

I'm attaching a patch to
mozilla/embedding/browser/webBrowser/nsDocShellTreeOwner.cpp which pushes the
new event queue before calling nsIWebBrowserChrome::CreateBrowserWindow(...)

This seems to fix the problem...

"CORE-231199","Make mapped-attribute hash case sensitive","Rigth now the hash for 'uniqued' mapped attributes is case insensitive wrt the
values of the attributes. This is good and all in theory since it allows us to
squeeze more attribute-maps together and thus have a smaller rule-tree and fewer
attribute-maps allocated.

However the disadvantage of having a case insensitive hash is that it's slower
then a case sensitive one. Having a case sensitive one would also make it easier
to use the same code for SVG and possibly XUL. And we'd be able to save some
code. There are also some attributes in html that should be case sensitive (like
background) so if we want to keep the current code we need to fix it anyway.

And it'll speed up the cases where we don't have a lot of elements with the same
attributes since hashing case sensitivly is faster the case insensitivly. I
would think this is a pretty common case too although i don't have any data to
back that up.

And in practice making the hash case sensitive probably won't cause a noticable
difference in number of unique maps for a page. In most cases where there are a
lot of elements with the same attributes the markup is generated either using
some GUI designer (composer frontpage) or generated through CGI. In both cases
it's pretty likly that the same casing will be used everywhere. And even for
manually created pages i doubt that one and the same page will use more then two
or three different casings.


This also raises the issue of weather we should sort the mapped attributes
(which we do to make the hash attribute-order-insensitive). However the gain
seems a lot smaller here so before anyone does this we should probably
investigate weather we'd actually win anything.


As a sidenote i should mention that the current hash is actually partly
case-sensitive. The code to calculate hash-values is case sensitive but the code
to check equality is not. The endresult is that we most of the time already are
case sensitive. This has been the case since unique attributes were introduced.",18,"0"

"FIREFOX_GRAVEYARD-368252","notify observers when a microsummary gets updated","In order to better enable extensions (and core code) to extend microsummary functionality it would be useful to broadcast a notification (via the observer service most likely) when a live title gets updated so that extensions can do additional work at that point.

For example an extension could use this to flash the live title or otherwise (f.e. using growl) bring the update to the attention of the user.

And an extension that allows users to specify refresh intervals for individual live titles might then modify the live title's expiration time from the default assigned by the microsummary service.

One question is whether it would make sense to additionally notify observers before initiating the update request (and giving them the opportunity to cancel or otherwise modify it) i.e. something like a microsummary-before-update notification in addition to a microsummary-after-update one.

Another issue is what to pass in the aSubject and someData parameters to nsIObserverService::notifyObservers.  Currently an nsIMicrosummary has no knowledge about the live title it's being used for (if any).  So just passing it as the value of the aSubject parameter doesn't give the observer enough information.

We could additionally pass the bookmark ID as the value of someData but that seems clunky.  Seems like we're going to have to either make nsIMicrosummary smarter about what it's being used for (bookmark label page tab label etc.) or pass some other object referencing both the nsIMicrosummary and the thing using it (nsIMicrosummaryConsumer?).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems Firefox is unusually slow compared to Chrome on the following JavaScript Mandelbrot Set:
http://warp.povusers.org/MandScripts/javascript2.html (click on Proceed in the bottom)
 
The problem however is not in JavaScript component (less than 1% of the cycles is in js3250.dll). Following is the VTune data about retired instructions. A huge 80% of the total cycles is spent in gkgfx and 85% of gkgfx is in nsRegion.cpp. A lot of rectangle insertions deletions and traversals are happening.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like we spend (on my hardware) about 1300ms getting to close().
Opera takes 1500 Safari 400.  After that though we have a
multi-second unresponsive hang which is presumably what Moh had profiled.

ccing roc and vlad since this stuff is their kettle of fish.

It looks like the images load one by one and invalidate their rects.
There are 10000 such rects of course.

So we basically end up under [ChildView drawRect:] called from NSView
code and from there spend our time in a 2-1 ratio under
nsViewManager::Refresh and nsThebesRegion::Union.  The latter is
certainly the building up of the region under drawRect.  The former is
largely the nsRegion::Or call from ConvertNativeRegionToAppRegionwith
some smattering of actually painting.  The time spent painting is almost
entirely under nsDisplaClip::OptimizeVisibility doing region operations.

In other words we spend more time sorting out the right region to paint
that it would take to just paint everything.

That reminds me strongly of bug 253001.  Would it make
sense to apply a similar approach here?  It looks like the opaque region
thing got backed out as part of the display list landing because all
that code went away.  But we should probably do it for both damage and
opaque regions.

------------SA-2008-069 - CCK FOR 5.X AND 6.X - XSS VULNERABILITIES------------

 * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-2008-069

 * Project: Content Construction Kit (third-party module)

 * Versions: 5.x 6.x

 * Date: 2008-November-5

 * Security risk: Minor

 * Exploitable from: Remote

 * Vulnerability: Cross site scripting

------------DESCRIPTION------------

The Content Construction Kit (CCK) allows certain privileged users to add
custom fields to content types using a web browser.

Some field labels and content-type names are displayed without appropriate
filtering in the administrative interface. Malicious users with the administer
content permission are able to exploit this issue and insert arbitrary HTML and
script code into pages. Such a cross site scripting attack (XSS) may lead to the
malicious user gaining full administrative access.

This is only an issue if you need any role separation between administrators
and users with the administer content permission.

------------VERSIONS AFFECTED------------

 * CCK for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-1.10

 * CCK for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.0 (including all RC releases)

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed CCK module
there is nothing you need to do.

------------SOLUTION------------

Install the latest version:

 * For Drupal 5.x install CCK 5.x-1.10 [ http://drupal.org/node/330570 ]

 * For Drupal 6.x install CCK 6.x-2.0 [ http://drupal.org/node/330573 ]

See also the CCK project page [ http://drupal.org/project/cck ].

Build Identifier: 

As requested I've opened this bug as a spin-off from 259325 which was
OpenBSD-centric.  The same problem could happen when compiling under any OS not
tested for in any of the conditionals among them NetBSD.  (As another example
I think older releases of everyone's favourite SVR4 flavour -- SCO Unix -- will
also break due to a lack of stdbool.h but I don't have an environment on-hand
to test with.)  Note that I've actually supplied this patch to NetBSD's pkgsrc
team and it's checked in
(http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=27033) so anyone
building through pkgsrc on any of its supported platforms (various OSes) won't
get a build error (at least with GCC compiling the source as C++) but I'd
prefer the developers here fix the problem upstream hence this report.

As far as the final conditional branch goes its comment says it's for those
that ship a standard C99 stdint.h header file but it's obviously not that
specific.  The patch I've suggested is only a fix for C++ merely a defence
against unnecessarily trying to include stdbool.h when compiling as C++.  Any
somewhat recent C++ compiler should support bool as an integral datatype.  While
the condition in question is intended in part to allow for older GCC releases
that still shouldn't be relevant when compiling as C++.  stdbool.h is a C99
header it's not for C++.  (Incidentally I have a test environment running
Solaris 7 with GCC 2.8.1 [not by choice] and it does accept a typedef for bool
in C I'm not sure why 2.91 wouldn't...  It also provides bool in C++.)  If
there are systems that ship with a stdbool.h that doesn't compile it'd be
better to test for them specifically.

For Un*x builds it would be neater to use GNU autoconf to determine what is
available and what is not rather than coding conditional statements that aren't
always going to provide the best choices.  For instance there's a block which
handles various SVR4 flavours of Unix including HP-UX.  Recent HP-UX releases
do ship with stdbool.h available so it would make sense to make use of it. 
Ideally you'd test for the existence of stdbool.h and anything else desired with
autoconf.  (Though I realize autoconf is only optional right now maybe this
isn't a compelling enough reason to make it mandatory.)

When the design mode for the document is set explicitly to be off then clicking on  the button in the test case URL above accesses the innerHTML property of a HTML element that should not have an innerHTML property.

Setting design mode too on fixes this problem:

"CORE-501265","Shell load() interprets file as not-UTF-8 (always ASCII I think)","Sputnik seems to assume that files loaded from disk are interpreted as UTF-8 which affects the behavior of a test with a UTF-8-encoded non-breaking space in it.  At a glance I think we effectively load files as though they were the equivalent file with every char in it exploded into a two-byte UCS-2 character so high-bit-set UTF-8 bytes make us fall over and die.  Since the shell's just our own custom repl how about if we switch it over to parsing input entirely as UTF-8?  Breaking change sure -- but it's our baby and I see no reason to waste much effort on making the shell handle multiple encodings not when we could be fixing actual bugs instead.

This affects at a minimum the following Sputnik test:

I am running latest Firefox on WinXP SP2. Every time I start up I have to go to Options>Privacy>Cookies and reset Allow sites to set cookies so I can get into sites that store my identity in cookies. Without doing this I cannot get into my.yahoo.com even by signing in because the attempt to get into the next page fails with no cookie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check Allow sites to set cookies 
2. Close Firefox
3. Go to my.yahoo.com

Actual Results:  
1. Instead of getting to my home page it goes to generic page with a sign in link. 
2. I sign in
3. It tells me Yahoo unable to set or retieve cookies and I must change mu settings.
4. I change setting as above and Yahoo works perfectly.
5. I close Firefox
6. I reopen firefox and go to my.yahoo.com
7. Repeats as above


Expected Results:  
Since I have stored an identity cookie which Firefox recognizes after I check Allow sites to set cookies Yahoo opens my personal home page.

This has not happened before. It just started happening about 5 days ago. I'm assuming Firefox updated itself with one or more patches at that time and one of them created this problem.
Since this has not been reported before It may be because of interaction with one of my installed extensions (I have many of them).",12,"0"

4) We should provide a link to see how the example work.
5) It's better to have examples for xhtml and xul both.
6) We should say that user can extend only standard widgets in nice way. And he should use types or mediatype in common case for that.
7) And if he wants to put new widgets (of non xforms tagname or namespace) then it can do some magic by placing xf:input and etc into his widget since bug 306526 is not fixed and nobody knows when it will be :).

The list of all tags (with checkboxes) that you get by toggling the Show all tags button inside the Edit this bookmark popup dialogue is not sorted correctly. Current sort order is upper-case a to z lower-case a to z then words that begin with upper-case umlauts finally lower-case umlauts. This is likely to confuse users who are looking for a specific tag in the list as that sort order doesn't make any sense at all in terms of usability. The dialogue should use at least use the same default sort order as in bookmarks Library > Tags: just sort all tags alphabetically (while ignoring case and umlauts). Ideally umlauts should be sorted in as ae oe ue but that might be a localization issue to be dealt with seperately.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have loads of tags with different sorts of initial letters: upper-case lower-case and German umlauts (ä ö ü = ae oe ue)
2. Open Edit this bookmark popup dialogue by clicking on yellow star
3. Click Show all tags button to toggle open the list of all tags (with checkboxes) in the dialogue
 


Actual Results:  
Tags in the list are sorted in a rather unexpected three-fold way that makes it unnecessary difficult to find the right tag (e.g. a tag named OEM Software might end up miles away from another tag named oem).

-- undesired sort order: --
upper-case a to z
lower-case a to z
upper-case umlauts a to z
lower-case umlauts a to z


Expected Results:  
At least use the same default sort order as in bookmarks Library > Tags:
-- desired sort order: --

Ideally umlauts should be sorted in as ae oe ue but that might be a localization issue to be dealt with seperately.


The effect of this can be quite annoying as (lower/upper-)case of a given tag is changed (edited) on the fly as you type. Say these are your tags in the wrong order as described in this bug:

OEM <--
Opel
oem software
offer
often
Österreich
österreichisch

Next time you do tag-as-you-type and accidentally type oem instead of OEM FF will edit the tag's name on the fly OEM becomes oem (for all affected bookmarks) and thus moves to a completely different place in the (wrong) sort order:

I use bugzilla-2.17.7. Every script except buglist.cgi somehow automagically
knows that I configured my Apache to send charset=utf-8. Buglist.cgi sends
ISO-8859-5 instead.

I've found and fixed the problem on my installation:

showbug.cgi line 363
---------------------
was:
  print Content-Type: text/html\n\n
replaced with:
  print Bugzilla->cgi->header()

showbug.cgi line 860
---------------------
was:
  $contenttype = text/html
replaced with:
  $contenttype = text/html charset=utf-8

Sorry I'm not so familiar with cvs to make a proper patch. And also I'm at all
not good at Perl and do not know where to get just a server's charset (not
entire header) to avoid hard-coding 'utf-8'. But I hope just finding places will
help :-).

When <menupopup onpopuphiding=event.preventDefault() is used the popup is supposed to be prevented from being hidden. That works but the popup then gets into a state where it can't be hidden if preventDefault isn't called on a later attempt to hide it or the popup can't be shown again. Also the event shouldn't be cancellable for content popups.

This is because for some reason I don't understand I wrote nsXULPopupManager::HidePopup to remove the popup from the open popups list before the popuphiding event when it should really be removed afterwards.

The 'is a popup open' checks needs to be a bit better. I think four states are needed: closed showing open and hiding.",14,"0"

Mozilla ignores the stale flag from WWW-Authenticate Response Header.

Stale is a flag indicating that the previous request from the client was
rejected because the nonce value was stale. 
If stale is TRUE (case-insensitive) 
the client may wish to simply retry the request
with a new encrypted response without reprompting the user for 
a new username and password.

But Mozilla reprompts the user in this case as well as 
when stale is FALSE or absent.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the digest authentication scheme on server
   (the implementation must response on incorrect nonce and set stale
    flag in WWW-Authenticate in this case). I use proxy server Oops
    with my modules to test.
2. After changing nonce-value on server side server responses on request based 
on stale nonce with 401 error (WWW-Authenticate with stale=TRUE)

The main phorum page of this web site use 2 graphics to display the stat of a
message (visible or not visible). The default is not show the message and I put
a graphic.

Well when you click in it. The message shows and the graphics is replaced for
another one (via javascript). But it doesn't change!

In IE the things work right

I believe that the javascript use standards methods and properties :-)

The problem I think is the 2nd graphic is not loaded. IE load the graphic
*later* when it is setted by javascript code.

I think that mozilla must load all that it need when the page is modified via
javascript: if the code chage the a graphic for another it must be loaded.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.laotraesquina.com.ar/
2. When the phorum page load. Click into the papiro graphic


Actual Results:  The message shows but the graphic doesn't change

Expected Results:  It'd have to change and load the new graphic setted by
javascript  (I think)
IE load it later and I believe that it must be the expected result because it is
very usefull for intranet/internet applications (with graphics and others html
components)",711,"1"

We would like to include two new aggregators in our l10n providing a better user-experience since their UI is available in Basque:
- Netvibes[1]
- Alesti[2]

At the moment we have these (in the mentioned order):
1. Bloglines
2. My Yahoo
3. Google Reader

I think this order would be better:
1. Netvibes
2. Alesti
3. Bloglines
4. Google Reader
5. My Yahoo

The first two because they're in Basque and are popularly used. Bloglines is widely used too so I think it's good to have it in third place followed by Google Reader. Yahoo is the less famous one.

Axel has told me we need approval from Alesti --I suppose Netvibes has already given its approval for other cases-- so I've emailed them to info@alesti.org (waiting for an answer).

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.5

I have an address book entry with the nickname wil.  When I type wil in the To line in the composition window the result is an entry who's last name is Wilbur and which has no nickname at all.

The algorithm for finding addresses in the phone book should have the highest precedence on a full string match of nickname (after all why did the user take the time to enter a nick name after all).  Imho the precedence should be:

1) Full string match on nickname
2) Full string match on last name
3) Full string match on first name
4) Initial string match on nickname
5) Initial string match on last name
6) Initial string match on first name

You may not think this is important but anything that causes mail to get sent to the wrong user inadvertantly is just about he worst possible problem a mailer can have.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an entry with wil as the nickname
2. Create an entry with Wilber as the last name
3. Enter wil in the To: field of the composition window

Actual Results:  
The entry with the last name Wilbur is autocompleted

Expected Results:  
The entry with the nickname wil should have been autocompleted

3) The Mozilla representative checks the certificate(s) into the NSS store and marks the bug RESOLVED FIXED.

Fix v.1

Not quite up to my usual CVS archaeology standards but:

At some point in the past in the pre-1.0-era before smileys were part of the theme we decided to fork editor's packaging so we could package up just the smileys instead of all the images in editor/ui/composer/content/icons/. Then after that we realized that although we don't need things like tag-body.gif which Composer shows when you enter the Show icons for all HTML tags mode that we don't have  shows tag-anchor.gif even in the normal view so Insert - Named Anchor would have... probably shown a broken image icon or maybe just nothing so we added mail/components/compose/content/icons/tag-anchor.gif.

Then smileys moved to the theme and (here's where my archaeology breaks down) whatever it was that was letting us find editor/content/ things in messenger.jar rather than comm.jar was removed and we went back to packaging all of editor/ui/composer/content/icons/ (or maybe we never changed anywhere other than on the aviary branch) so now we're just jarring up something which nothing can access since there's no .manifest saying to either look for content editor there or to overlay any editor/content/ URI with anything from there.

(Doing some restriction of what composer bits and bobs we package wouldn't be a bad thing but copying the files is the wrong approach: we should either ifdef editor/ui/jar.mn (particularly reasonable given the way we already do ifdef editor/ui/locales/jar.mn) or do what we do with mailnews/jar.mn ifdeffing the whole thing and jarring what we want with absolute paths from a file in mail/ instead.)",6,"0"

"CORE-338033","No visible focus indicator on image map areas with black background","Env:Bon Echo 20060515 nightly build

Description:
When you TAB to a portion of an image map that has a black background or a black image on a black background there is no visible focus indicator.  There should be a dotted line around the image or image map area.

Firefox displays the visual focus indicator (dotted line) fine on areas with non-black background.  It appears to use a black dotted line which is invisible on an image with a black background.  To contrast Internet Explorer appears to sense the dark background of the image and in that case uses a white dotted line instead of black to produce a visible keyboard focus indicator.

Recreate:
1. Load this URL in Firefox (Bon Echo):
     http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap
    There will be a picture of the sun with two planets (mercury and venus)
     in the right pane of the window.
2. Press TAB until you see sun.htm mercur.htm  and venus.htm cycle through
    the status bar.  (It helps if you click the mouse on the text directly above
    the image then press TAB.  

Error 1:  You should see a rectangular visual focus indicator (dotted line) around the Sun
   then a circular dotted line around the 1st planet (mercury)  then a circular
   dotted line around the 2nd planet (venus) as you tab through the links.
   I assume the (black) dotted lines are actually there but because of the black background 
   they are invisible.  Firefox should sense the darkness of the background color
   and use a white dotted line instead of black in this case.

Error 2: If you tab through the image map watch the status line at the bottom of the
   Firefox window.  You see the status text cycle from ...sun.htm to ...mercur.htm 
   and finally to ...venus.htm.  If you keep pressing TAB past the venus link notice
   that the status bar DOES NOT CHANGE as you continue to tab.  
   When you tab away from the link to venus.htm the status line should be 
  blanked out so it does not imply that the venus.htm link is still available
  at the new keyboard focus position.

You can find other images with this same problem.
For example on the IBM.COM home page ( http://www.ibm.com/us/ )
The IBM logo image at the upper left corner has a black background.
If you tab to that image you also do not see the visual focus indicator
(dotted line).",2539,"1"

It would be nice to get rid of the 'op' local variable. I think it would help my work on bug 442379. In particular GCC seems to have a hard time optimizing this variable in the call-threading version because read-write dependences cross op dispatch. Also eventually I will want to stop updating regs.pc as well so this is a good first step.

The perf results look OK in SunSpider as well: 1% speedup overall. Most benchmarks are a few percent faster a few are a few percent slower. The worst is math-cordic which is 4.6% slower. I don't know why that happens but is may be that GCC doesn't CSE *regs.pc when it is used more than once in a case. We could consider applying that optimization manually.",1945,"1"

Mozilla loads Usenet group indexfiles (.msf) to memory when browsing group.
Naturally memory load increases amount of how large index is. Unfortunately
Mozilla 'forgets' to unload group indexfile when moving to next group that
results huge memory consumption especially when reading large groups.

In worst case one group indexfile takes ~10MB of diskspace resulting 100MB
memory usage after reading 10 groups. Memory usage returns to normal level only
after *ALL* mozilla windows have been closed. 

As you can see in screenshot mozilla takes ~120MB of memory and ~120MB of VM
after ~10 groups none of them are binarygroups. This bug leads to severe
overall system performance slowdown even on high-end machines and could crash
low-end systems.

In the Gecko DOM Reference check the DOM _Element_ Reference:

http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_el_ref.html#1022767

If you scroll down you'll find the description of possible Event Handlers for an
HTML element e.g. onclick. There's also a link to an example:

http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_el_ref63.html

It states:
  p.onclick = alert('moot!')

I think that's plain wrong. You can not assign a string to an event handler but
only a function reference. Thus it should rather read 

 p.onclick=function() {
        alert('moot!')
}

Additionally on the DOM _Element_ Reference page the event handler property is
said to be read only. Thats also wrong. And the example - albeit it does not
work - contradicts this.

2. Focus changes aren't calculated correctly. We shouldn't be making assumptions about the first responder test for focus changes explicitly.
3. If we bail because of a focus change make sure to reset *all* of the member state variables that we modified. This doesn't matter if we bail because we were destroyed so not changing that case.
4. Better variable names and test structure. We can do things more efficiently (via better scoping) when the logic is coded more clearly.",6,"0"

bug 258465 Comment #100 Rimas Kudelis  2006-09-25 05:31:07 PDT

Anyone want to try this feed for testing: http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.php ? It
consists of three items and should generate new duplicates every five minutes
(so make sure you update often enough).

The catch here is: Every five minutes the feed changes its HTTP response code
from 200 (OK) to Error 503 (server failure). When simulating a failure it
doesn't present the user with any entries at all and this seems like enough to
trigger the duplication when the entries are back after five minutes.

You can see the colorized sourcecode of the file here:
http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.phps .

I am able to duplicate the problem using the test feed at
http://www.vu.lt/RQ/testfeed.php using Thunderbird 1.5.0.7.  I configured a new
RSS News & Blogs account that checks for new articles every 2 minutes and
contains only this test feed.

bug 258465 Comment #102 Magnus Melin  2006-09-25 11:29:22 PDT

I also get duplicate items for that feed (using Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux
i686 en-US rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060925 Thunderbird/2.0b1pre ID:2006092503)

bug 451737 Comment #3 From  Unknown W. Brackets   2008-08-24 14:58:34 PDT 

Well this is because of invalidateItems().  You see how it works is this
step-by-step as I understand:

1. Feed added to Thunderbird.

2. On first check:
   a. every item is parsed.
   b. one by one added to the datastore (with valid and stored arcs.)

3. On next and subsequent checks:
   a. valid is unasserted for each item in datastore.
   b. items are added back into the datastore (by setting valid.)
   c. duplicates are checked for by existance in datastore with stored set.
   d. items that still don't have valid are removed.

So what's happening (easier to reproduce with a feed that alternates between
503/empty and 200/not empty) is that it gets the empty list clears all the
items out:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/thunderbird/source/mail/extensions/newsblog/content/feed-parser.js#117

And then flushes it (3d above.)  Next time it checks its duplicate cache is
entirely empty and so it assumes all items are new.

To fix this I think the following might help:

1. AFAICT Feed seems to expect that a 503 will call onerror instead of onload
but I'm sure it doesn't check the status code.  A good place might be in
onDownloaded or here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mail/extensions/newsblog/content/Feed.js#357

2. The clearing I mentioned (invalidateItems call) happens even if the feed is
entirely empty.  I assume this is done to not store things indefinitely so not
clearing it for an empty feed would help.

3. Feeds can very - they might come from load balanced servers future items
may be removed (bringing back older ones) etc.  It would probably solve *a
lot* of duplication problems to simply do expiration by date (e.g. wait a day
or a week.)  I'm not sure what's best there though... doing it immediately
seems clearly brittle to me.

I thought I'd make this comment in case it helps.  I'm not familiar with the
code really at all but if anyone can confirm my understanding a bit (top
level) I'm happy to submit a patch (just have to figure out mercurial...)

I won't have time to test and write solution #3 above in the next week (I'm a
busy guy like most) but #1 and #2 are very easy.

That'd work for 503 errors and we should probably do it but it won't solve
the problem for other cases of intermittent feed items that don't register an
HTTP failure which I've noticed in a variety of feeds (particularly Google
News ones).

Hmm that seems problematic given that feeds can be legitimately empty.

(In reply to comment #5)
> In other words it never looks at the actual messages to determine uniqueness

Indeed and another solution to this problem might be to also check actual
messages although that has its own problems since users can delete messages
after reading them and we don't want those messages to reappear.  Forumzilla
used to do an additional check like this but I'm not sure it was worth it.

Also reproducible in 20080821225349 Thunderbird/3.0b1pre. The two hints that
the feed fetch is bad are the error response and the feed content having 0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. if already exists delete downloads.sqlite

3. in download manager dialog choose save file
Actual Results:  
After selecting save file it takes quite a long time until windows file selector opens (Probably in this time downloads.rdf is converted to downloads.sqlite - downloads.rdf file size is about 340K).
For every entry in downloads.rdf the error message x:\...\file.zip could not be saved because an unknown error occurred. Try saving to a different location. is displayed.
In error console there are several Error: too much recursion shown.
After clicking through all error messages the download manager window opens showing the file progress as finished/failed/canceled. 
But no file is really downloaded. 
The partition with the download directory would have enough space to save the files.

Expected Results:  
Import of downloads.rdf happens without error messages.

I tried to strip down downloads.rdf to reproduce the error with a smaller file. But unfortunately the error occurs only with the original file. Because a lot of private urls in the file I can't attach it to this bug. I will try to create a downloads.rdf that triggers this bug the next days.",73,"0"

instead consumers should be able to ask to be notified when an input stream
(or output stream) becomes ready ... by ready i mean either closed
readable or writable.  then consumers could be in complete control of the data
flow.

i think a lot of networking code could be simplified if the streams could tell a
consumer when they are ready.

i've put together a prototype implementation of nsPipe that provides these
interfaces:

  nsIAsyncInputStream : nsIInputStream

  nsIAsyncOutputStream : nsIOutputStream

"CORE-326714","GNOME/GTK icon code is extremely slow","N.B.: Most people don't use builds with the code that this bug is complaining about -- it's not enabled in release builds since --disable-gnomeui defaults to doing a configure test for the version and the build machines don't *currently* have that version although that could change in the future.  But it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions.

The GNOME icon code in modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/gtk/ is really really slow.  I've described this on IRC in the past and some people had useful suggestions.  On my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds *per icon*.  This is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has OK and Cancel buttons (since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time).  But it's a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file: URL in any displayed bookmarks -- if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file: URLs in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi-second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open.

Using some printf(!) timing since profiling of things involving X server etc. can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsIconChannel::InitWithGnome seem to be:
 * the call to gnome_icon_lookup typically around 300ms
 * the g_object_unref of the icon theme (odd) typically around 50ms
 * the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot -- sometimes it's almost instantaneous sometimes it's near 50ms sometimes in between

Bug 448515 refers to how there isn't a Profiledbuild option.

In this bug I wrote how I was able to successfully build Thunderbird with PGO but I had to disable PGO in one module in the mozilla core.

In mozilla/modules/lcms/src/Makefile.in I had to add the environment variable ( or make variable not sure) NO_PROFILE_GUIDED_OPTIMIZE = 1.

My thought is the mozilla core should not have to be modified to allow thunderbird to be built with PGO.  The Thunderbird build configuration should be modified to some how enable PGO for Thunderbird since Firefox can be built with PGO without modifying this particular Makefile.

I am currently working on this problem and need help and direction.  The work I've done so far can be found here. 

http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/PGO_Related_Bugs#0.2_Release

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
( html format can be found here - http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/PGO_Related_Bugs/Thunderbird )

1.
Modify the file $topsrcdir/mozilla/modules/lcms/src/Makefile.in and add the line NO_PROFILE_GUIDED_OPTIMIZE = 1. 

2.
Configure the .mozconfig in the $topsrcdir for ac_add_options --enable-application=mail and mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=mail. My .mozconfig looks like

ac_add_options --enable-application=mail
mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=mail
mk_add_options MOZ_MAKE_FLAGS=-j5
ac_add_options --disable-vista-sdk-requirements
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-optimize
ac_add_options --disable-debug

3.
In the $topsrcdir execute the build command make -f client.mk build MOZ_PROFILE_GENERATE=1

4.
After it has finished Thunderbird needs to be profiled. Run the executable found in $objdir/mozilla/dist/bin and do a few scenarios and close Thunderbird. 

5.
This next step I did not due on Windows and it worked ok. I have to try it and see what happens. I'm told this step has to take place.

In the $topsrcdir execute the build command make -f client.mk clean

6.
In the $topsrcdir execute the build command make -f client.mk build MOZ_PROFILE_USE=1

"CORE-461031","Investigate mobile responsiveness problems caused by not returning to the event loop","Vlad wrote an instrumentation patch to see why Fennec running on VMs has serious responsiveness issues while loading heavy pages such as CNN.com. Part of his patch works by basically doing setTimout(0) and watching to see how long it takes before the setTimeouts fire. On a VM he saw a lot of setTimeouts firing at regular intervals followed by a massive slowdown (on the order of one second).

In a test run he saw the following event being handled:

{BM(44)BM(10)ES(94)BM(103)BM(7)BM(54)BM(18)BM(37)BM(33)BM(11)BM(17)BM(10)BM(21)BM(62)BM(20)BM(16)BM(20)BM(7)BM(40)BM(17)BM(92)RP4(676)-E(0xb1a53de0676)}

To translate: we're calling BuildModel a ton of times during the same event without ever returning to the event loop. The sum of all of the BuildModel calls is quite a lot and could explain the loss of responsiveness.

I realized that what this probably means is that we're executing a script with many calls to document.write() each of which calls into nsParser::BuildModel. In this case the parser won't ever interrupt (and even when it's done parsing we won't get all the way back out to the event loop). We could verify this by adding a printf around nsParser::ResumeParse to make sure that we're not sticking around in ResumeParse forever but actually entering and exiting the parser code.",9,"0"

Under some circumstances doing a search on tripadvisor for a hotel for example scole inn and then clicking on the search result will crash camino.  The following error will appear in the console: camino[304] Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSRangeException: *** -[NSCFArray objectAtIndex:]: index (1) beyond bounds (1)]. I encountered this in normal browsing but it's easiest to reproduce a similar or same crash following steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start with clean profile following procedure in Camino FAQ or use troubleshoot camino
2.Set preference Open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows
3.Go to tripadvisor.com and search for scole inn and select first search result
4. Click Window and note presence of hidden popunder window. The presence of the popunder window seems needed to produce a crash.
5. Go to preferences and select Tab bar always stays visible.
Actual Results:  
On my system Camino will crash.

Expected Results:  
Tab Bar is displayed. I am not sure how Camino is supposed to handle the hidden window that is already there when you select always display tab bar or how Camino is expected to handle a popunder window if the open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows preference has been selected.

The tripadvisor site sets a cookie call CommercePopUnder and the presence of this cookie and value seems to have something to do with the crash. For example Camino will NOT crash if the cookie is present with the value SuppressAll.",1,"0"

As the canvas tag is not a standard anyway may I suggest the addition of a drawString method with parameters for font type size and string. 

In order to achieve usability canvas really requires an equivalent prototype method however the established prototype functions take immense amounts of clocktime and significantly (and unnessessarily) slow down the canvas. The current lack of standard in canvas makes it possible to include a drawString method before it is too late thus adding new possibilities to the object.

As reported in bug 338748 thunderbird mixes up Sender and From headers.  I have a bunch of messages which have both Sender: and From: headers.  I notice in the 'quick search' box that it's possible to search on Sender.  So I typed in the value that's in the Sender: header of a lot of my email.  To my surprise no messages were found by the search.  I then entered a string which appears only in From: headers of some messages and the Sender quick search matched those messages

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
When you quick search for Sender it doesn't search the Sender headers.  It does search the From headers.  There doesn't seem to be any way to do a quick search against the contents of the Sender: headers.

Expected Results:  
I would expect a quick search for Sender to match Sender.  If I wanted to search the From: headers I would expect that quick search to be called From.",385,"1"

Despite this there are certs with NO GeneralName in the SubjectAltName

When a SubjectAltName extension contains at least one GeneralName but 
it is not a DNSName we correctly treat it as if there was no Subject
AltName extension as RFC 2818 seems to require.

The problem manifested itself in two forms:
(a) Doing a attr=createAttributeNS then element.setAttributeNode(attr) should 
trigger the creation of a namespace declaration for attr.namespaceURI on 
element. It doesn't.
(b) When doing appendChild(elem) where elem=createElementNS(...) a namespace 
declaration isn't emitted if a previous element with the same namespace 
prefix/URI was appended to the same parent without children. Demonstration code

Run search-window/test-search-window.js then delete the SearchWindowA folder. TB then crashes.

OR:

Create a new local folder put a message inside. Run a saved search inside the folder for that message saving as a saved search. Delete the whole local folder (including the saved search subfolder). TB then crashes.

"TESTING_GRAVEYARD-416049","Minotaur - Needs better human readable output","Created attachment 301800
Current output diff of test-output.xml files on a finnish build

The current tool does not output decently readable files and sometimes the error messages can be misleading.  For example if the tool discovers that the Build Under Test did not produce ANY bookmarks output it reports that bookmark lists are not the same length which doesn't necessarily raise the same red flags as build xxx does not have any default bookmarks.  

This bug is to address this and clean it up.  

In short the plan is to:
1. Provide a better diff output when comparing the test-output.xml files 
2. Provide more meaningful messages when encountering empty files (bookmarks output.xml's etc)
3. Provide the same type of diff output when comparing the bookmarks files so that a person can easily analyze the results file without having to bend their mind around two different output schemes.
4. The diff output must of course handle UTF-8 encodings properly

I will attach an example of a current output log.",27,"0"

"CORE_GRAVEYARD-230632","[BEOS] nsImage::DrawTile() to be rewritten","Currently DrawTile uses two-dimesnional loop which is calling
BView::DrawBitmapSaync() to render tiled background.

On such sites as http:://www.nbc.com it causes calling DrawBitmap up to about
MILLION (1 000 000)  times depending on window size.
As DrawBitmap*() involves app_server even called on BView attached to
off-screen BBitmap it causes absolutely untolerable speed drop. Especially
if/when some scaling/cropping appears

Such code must be replaced. Idea is:
1)create temporary bitmap with size of repaint area.
2)render tile image on that tmpbitmap using memcpy() operations
3)use DrawBitmap once - to render prepared image of repaint-area to drawing surface.

Notice for those who are unfamiliar with Mozilla drawing. We cannot use memcpy
to render tiles on drawin surface itself without tmpbitmap.
Because that surfce is abstractions over several type of canvas and there may be
as BBitmap behind it but also BWindow. We don't know it and we shoudln't rely
on such assumptions.

Mozilla should be able to optionally authenticate using NTLM to a server without
prompting the user for username and password with a dialog box (instead
retrieving that data from the client itself similarly to Internet Explorer).
Given the security issues surrounding this it should be limited in some way
either by not being the default or by only occurring to a set IP range or some

the maemo gtk patches always turn on extension events which means the X11 MotionNotify compression (from bug 459532) wasn't actually removing any of the motion events from the queue.

A more proper fix for this is to get the events from gdk not from Xlib since gdk will take care of all the extension events for us and map them to GdkMotionEvent's thereby opening them up to compression along with normal motion events.",60,"0"

I have a folder which contains files and folders whoes name contain non-latin
characters such as cyrillic and chinse idiograms. Browsing this folder with the
file:// protocol I only see the files with latin characters. I should also note
that the file:// protocol appears to be insisting on displaying in cp1225. This
is an issue since Windows stores long file names in UTF8. This is observed with
the release version of 1.4 and I am certain it effects previous version. I can
not confirm whether this issue affects other platforms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure that all possible languages are checked in the regional-options
control panel. 
2. Create folder containing files with name using non-latin characters such as
cyrillic - you can use 'character map' to help you.
3. Browse the folder and see the results.

I see some strange behaviour related to thread sorting which I am able to
reproduce for a minimal test case with exactly one thread in one of my folders.
Sorting is set to Date/Ascending/Threaded and the thread is unfolded.

This thread should contain 5 mails (i.e. one original and 4 follow-ups). Only
the original and the first follow-up are displayed.

As soon as I manually close this thread the whole thread simply disappears and
won't come back until I switch to another folder and back. Then the original and
first follow-up mails are visible again.

Changing the view to Unthreaded will still show only the original and first
follow-up mail but after switching to another folder and back all the thread's
mails will suddenly be visible in their unthreaded order. Changing back to
Threaded all but the original and first follow-up will disappear again.

I also have a testbed with some more threads (chronologically after this bad
thread). Whenever collapsing/expanding the first (bad) thread parts of the
subsequent threads seem to get swallowed and disappear.

Yet after manually moving certain follow-up mails to another folder and back
everything works as expected all the time.

I have this minimal testbed as a separate folder file. So if need be I can
provide this to anyone who wants to take a look at this problem.

Kind regards

PPC UAs now include PPC Mac OS X Mach-O 10.4

You simply cannot currently create a CFM build of Gecko anymore. At this point Mach-O is just unnecessary cruft in the PPC UA.

However removing a token from our UA may break websites. Though matching on Mach-O probably/hopefully isn't common since at this point all it tells you is that someone is running a PPC build which they could easily get by matching PPC.

Along those same lines I am having a hard time thinking of situations in which someone would have been using Mach-O to do useful detection of anything that's relevant today. It doesn't detect Mac OS X since only PPC builds have it. It was never the only way to detect if you were pre-X or X and even if it was it would have been a pretty unreliable indicator as CFM for OS X builds were shipped or at least I get that impression from bugzilla history.

~aa123bb -> [123bb] [123bb] [123] [bb]

Expected Results:  it should say (and does so in Netscape 4.x ):
~aa123bb -> [~aa123bb] [~aa] [123] [bb]

Testcase: (jacascript code from a bookmarklet)
----
javascript:string=~aa123bb regexp=/(.*[a-z])?(\d+)(\w*)/
result = string.match(regexp)
alert(string+  -> [+result[0]+] [+result[1]+] [+result[2]+]
[+result[3]+])
------
The regexp is supposed to break up the string into a an optional part ending
with a letter then a number and then more letters. Note: It seems to work for
just matching the first 2 parts of the regexp against ~aa123",51,"0"

Running the firefox Bash script on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) crashes with the following error message:

dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libsqlite3.dylib
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security
  Reason: Incompatible library version: Security requires version 9.0.0 or later but libsqlite3.dylib provides version 1.0.0

This is because the shell script alters DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH such that the libsqlite3.dylib file in the Firefox directory takes precedence over the one in /usr/lib and the Firefox version is incompatible with Snow Leopard.

Executing the firefox-bin binary directly does not cause this problem since the default DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is being used.

See http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=432894 for some comments about this.  It affects users trying to start the Profile Manager and Selenium-RC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.5.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.
2. Open the Terminal application.
3. Run the following command:  /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
Actual Results:

Expected Results:

Either a newer version of libsqlite3.dylib must be included or maybe none at all (use the version that comes with the OS).

The problem can be worked around by manually replacing the /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/libsqlite3.dylib with the version in /usr/lib.",106,"0"

This option badly needs an exception for javascript links especially when new

Example cases: online game sites like pogo.com and zone.msn.com that open a java
applet game in its own little window are forced to use a new tab in the main

tabs that are open.

Actual Results:  
Firefox resized itself to the game (Sweet Tooth in this case) according to the
applet's instructions rendering the web pages open in other tabs nearly

making the game look rather silly.

Archive in the GMail IMAP is actually a delete operation as the message continues to reside in the [GMail]/All Mail folder.  The delete command in the Inbox will act exactly as the Archive method in GMail.  The delete command in a sub-folder will remove the label from the message the message still being available from All Mail.

4) NOW select a case update status to PASSED OR FAILED OR RUNNING or anything pretty much.  Scrolling window updates status of that case but also displays back from the dead all previous runs of that particular case.  Need to hit filter again to get rid of them.  In one test plan we had this happened consistently for every single test case.  I just tested another second run of a test plan and observed that for some cases old case run loaded for others not.  Filters in general for this tab a big buggy.  Filter will not save with RUNNING selected as a status and if several statuses are selected seems to throw one or some away upon save.  I only mention because these problems might be related may be a bug in the part of the software that filters that runs?

Apologies in advance if this is a known bug and there's a patch I looked through the bugs and did not see anything similar tho it seems hard to believe noone has encountered.  Rest of the app works great and we are very very happy.

Given that requesting a GC causes bailouts *and* our allocation routines are not especially parallelized this turns out to be crucial for performance for applications where the parallel kernel does a lot of allocation.

If the user has two identity : aaa@bbb.ccc and ddd.aaa@bbb.ccc.

Build Identifier: 

Running the tests with ant-junit all reports a lot of failed tests. Running tests as explained at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Running_the_Rhino_tests doesn't report any failure (at least for interpreted mode).
This shows that there is a big problem at least in one of the two methods.

The first failing test reported when running the tests as junit tests is lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js. Which is not reported as failing by JsDriver.

If I add following as first statement of JsDriver.excluded:
            if (!path.contains(lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js))
            	return true
and run JsDriver tests again then only this single test is run... and if fails exactly like when running it as unit test.

For me this shows a really big problem in the tests. Particularly this seems to mean that we can't trust the results of JsDriver and that the unit test result are (more?) correct. In which case a lot of tests fail currently!

Additionally do we really need JsDriver? It is important to be able to build and run the tests in automatic build process and have usable results that we can trust. JUnit seems better suited for this purpose.

I set the severity of this issue as critical because I think that we can't have any reliable information on Rhino's quality as long as it is not fixed.

event.mTime is a uint32_t and mTapStartTime is a uint64_t -- so the left side of the comparisons ends up having type uint64_t.

MAX_TAP_TIME is an int (i.e. it's signed) for some reason. It's only got one usage outside of the two lines quoted above -- it's passed to PostDelayedTask here:

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040129 Firebird/0.8.0+

The increment algorithm in the validateLeafName() function in nsHelperAppDlg.js
(and the equivalent code in contentAreaUtils.js) does not work if the filename
does not contain a dot. This bug causes Firebird to hang if you save an
extension-less file to a folder that already contains a file of the same name.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/src/nsHelperAppDlg.js.in#254

Any file which does not already have a number appended will fail this test:

  var parts = /.+-(\d+)(\..*)?$/.exec(aLocalFile.leafName)
  if (parts) { ...

And will fallback to the else case unfortunately without a dot in the filename
the replace will fail:

  aLocalFile.leafName.replace(/\./ -1$

This means the filename will never increment and thus the condition in the while
can never be met and so FB goes into an infinite loop.

1. Make Save all files to this folder is selected in Options->Downloads
2. Visit the URL - http://www.pikey.me.uk/mozilla/test/dlbug.html

I don't know if this is the cause of all the time I've had a desired tab close when I wasn't expecting it but it's a confirmed cause of many of them and needs fixing.

Suppose you open a new tab. A blank tab appears and the focus is taken to the address bar for entry of the desired address. Whilst entering the address you decide actually you don't need that page after all. So you close it with the normal key combination for close tab.

Then not only your new blank tab is closed but also the NEXT tab is closed as well. If you only had one tab open prior to the above FF itself shuts down too.

It is obvious that logically what has happened is that the edge case where the current tab is newly displayed blank but no web page has yet loaded into it is not correctly processed in the close tab function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See above.
Actual Results:  
See above. 
A second tab is closed that was not directed to be closed. Data is lost.

Expected Results:  
Existing valid tabs should not close when the current tab is closed.

I have also had many cases (harder to reproduce) where a current tab being worked on has closed and pathologically a second previous tab has closed too. Most of these were not new tabs. So probably there is a second bug in this function with similar effect. Please when rechecking this function look for other cases by which a 2nd tab might accidentally be closed when the close-tab function is used.",13,"0"

Steps to Reproduce:
1. regular link to courier-imap mail account
2. settings: when sending mail automatically place a copy in sent mail folder of
imap account 
3.

Actual Results:  
The sent mail folder of my account at an courier imap mailserver is working
correctly ie sent mail ends up there and the headers of the mail look ok to.
HOWEVER I can not select a columnheader recipient and can only choose sender.
Unsurprisingly the sender is always me.

Expected Results:  
it should understand that in sent mail folders you need a recipient column
instead of sender. If not automatically at leat the option should be there in
the list of availble columns to display

no crashes it works fine.",36,"0"

My guess as to what happened is that:
 * we called gtk_clipboard_request_contents with a stack address
 * wait_for_retrieval timed out
 * clipboard_contents_received was called later and then accessed a stack data structure that was no longer valid.  (I'd have expected valgrind to say it's an address in the stack segment beyond the stack top but apparently not...)

It seems like either:
 * the retrieval_context object should be heap-allocated in case wait_for_retrieval doesn't wait long enough
 * we should cancel the request for the contents (if possible although I don't see a way looking at the API)",1323,"1"

"NSS-135261","SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE semantic troubles","The SSL documentation recommends that servers that wish to require SSL
cert-based client authentication should set SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE 
to PR_FALSE and then check for the presence of a cert on the SSL socket
after the handshake is complete (e.g. when getting the client's request)
and deny the request at that time if the cert is absent.  

There's a problem with doing that with the current implementation of 
SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE.  The problem occurs when an SSL client has 
previously established an SSL session with the server one that did not
include client authentication and that has not expired.  When the client 
connects to the server again if SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 0 (PR_FALSE)
the SSL code will simply restart the existing SSL session and will not
do a new FULL SSL handshake with the result that the user's cert is not
requested from the client and the client repeatedly receives whatever
error message the server sends back when client auth is absent.  

In that same situation if SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 1 (PR_TRUE) SSL
will refuse to restart the old SSL session and will instead force a 
new FULL SSL handshake requesting client authentication.  But if the 
client does not have cert the SSL library will terminate the handshake 
and the TCP connection which doesn't allow the server to send back a
better error message.  (This is the behavior that the SSL documentation
recommends NOT to do.)

So what is needed is another setting of SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE one 
that behaves partly like PR_TRUE in that it refuses to restart old
SSL sessions if they didn't do client auth but also behaves partly 
like PR_FALSE in that it allows the SSL handshake to continue and
doesn't terminate the TCP connection if the client fails to provide
client auth.  

I can think of a couple of ways to implement this.  

One is to change the behavior of SSL when SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 
PR_FALSE so that it behaves as described in the preceeding paragraph.  
That change would assume that any server that requests SSL client auth 
really is going to require it and is not going to allow operations 
(other than returning error message) to proceed without a client cert.  

Another is to create a new value for SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE that is 
neither PR_FALSE nor PR_TRUE.  There actually already exists one such
undocumented value.  SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE can be set to ((PRBool)2). 
Then it behaves as for PR_TRUE but only on the first handshake on a 
TCP connection.  It behaves like PR_FALSE on subsequent handshakes.
So one could propose the new value ((PRBool)3) to have the behavior
described above.

Comments on the choice of these is invited.

Soon I will attach patches that implement these proposals.",79,"0"

Operating in accordance with the High Assurance Level defined in the Certificate Policy(CP) of Chunghwa Telecom ecommerce Public Key Infrastructure (ePKI) ePKI Root Certification Authority (eCA) is the trust anchor of ePKI. Acting as the interface between certification authority (CA) within and without ePKI eCA is responsible for carrying out cross-certification: issuing and managing the certificates of Level 1 subordinate CAs' within ePKI as well as the certificates of CAs from without.

The eCA is responsible for the processing of firsthand certificate applications and revocations. There is no need to set up a Registration Authority (RA) of eCA. The eCA accepts the applications from the subject CAs and authenticates them.

The eCA is a commercial CA. It is located in Taipei Taiwan. The disaster recovery site of the eCA is located in Taichung Taiwan. eCA has two subordinate CAs : CHTCA and Public CA. The CHTCA is the internal CA of Chunhwa telecom(CHT) which signs certificates for CHT employees. The Public CA signs certificates for CHT clients.

When catching the keydown event through an event listner it is impossible to
cancel the event and have it not propegate up to the Mozilla GUI layer if the
key combination is bound to a Mozilla shortcut. Even though the event *should*
be cancelable ( even e.cancelable is true ) the Mozilla action happens anyway.

This is making it impossible to develop a browser-based application that wants
to make use of any key combinations Mozilla deeps appropriate to commandeer.

I am also constantly having problems with Find as you type taking over *every*
kepress. It seems to also be impossble to cancel through the DOM.

"CORE-919144","Improve handling of nsDisplayFixedPosition and other layerizing properties that don't create stacking contexts","CSS properties that need to set properties on layers fall into two categories: those that force their element to be a stacking context and those that don't. The former case is relatively easy to handle: nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForChild recognizes the property as creating a stacking context and calls nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForStackingContext which then creates a display item which returns something other than LAYER_NONE from nsDisplayItem::GetLayerState and builds a layer with the right properties set on it in nsDisplayItem::BuildLayer. The element being a stacking context means all its descendant content can be rendered as the children of a single display item.

The latter case is difficult to handle because the element's descendants may be interleaved in z-order with other content that is not affected by the CSS property so multiple layers must be modified for a given CSS property on a given element. For position:fixed we tried to handle this by creating multiple nsDisplayFixedPosition display items and later opportunistically merging them. This turns out to be a real pain for lots of reasons. For example it complicates invalidation and it's complex to make sure that the right display items are created and merged. It also interacts poorly with our invariant that display item (frame key) pairs are unique.

We already have a better way to handle the latter case and we use it for scrolling. FrameLayerBuilder calls nsLayoutUtils::GetActiveScrolledRoot on the frame for every display item to figure out what the nearest scrolling ancestor is and display items are clustered into ThebesLayers so that all the items in a given ThebesLayer have the same active scrolled root. Each ThebesLayer is given a transform based on the scroll position of the active scrolled root for its items. (In bug 876321 and bug 913444 I extend that so that elements with animated top/left/right/bottom and margins are also considered active scrolled roots --- and it works beautifully and simply.)

I think we can keep extending this approach to handle position:fixed touch-action and other properties that don't create stacking contexts. Here's how it looks:
-- GetActiveScrolledRoot is generalized to compute for each display item a key tuple of the values that will determine properties of its ThebesLayer. The members of this tuple will be:
* The nearest geometric ancestor frame that is being scrolled or having its position animated or is position:fixed.
* A boolean indicating whether the display item should trigger default panning behavior when touched.
Other fields can be added as needed.
-- Items with different key tuples are forced into different layers. Thus all items in a ThebesLayer have the same key tuple.
-- FrameLayerBuilder is responsible for assigning layer properties to ThebesLayers (and other layers) based on the key tuple. These properties include a layer transform fixed positioning properties and some new property for touch-action.

The first thing to do here is to rework nsDisplayFixedPosition to basically get rid of the display item and generalize GetActiveScrolledRoot instead.",58,"0"

4. Enough time passes and the image cache entry is removed from the cache by the nsExpiryTracker.
5. The validation results finally come back and the image needs to be re-loaded. The old image gets removed from the cache -- but wait! it's already removed!

Step 5 is a bit iffy since the only stacks I've ever seen for bug 480352 involve Cancel(). I'd expect a mix between Cancel() and the explicit RemoveFromCache in imgCacheValidator unless it's really unusual for images to need to be re-loaded when they're being validated.

"MAILNEWS_CORE-391402","Potential IMAP URL queueing regression","It seems that a certain IMAP Url sequence that I'm using for the new roaming service may have exposed a potential glitch in the IMAP URL queueing setup.

Right before I start to send off a request to save an attachment part from a message (non-cached message) I was calling |UpdateFolder()| on the listened folder (not INBOX). Then I build a to-do list of update messages to process (saving a TOC file is the first step). Then one at a time I process each message. This was working before the patch to fix bug 381992 was landed. However afterwords I can only get the attachment to save correctly if I remove my |UpdateFolder()| call. 

When the |UpdateFolder| call is made I see the |OnStartRunningUrl| call made in |nsMsgSaveListener| however I never see any calls made from relatively important libmime functions (like |imeObject_parse_begin()|) or OnStopRequest/OnDataAvailable. As mentioned above removing the |UpdateFolder()| call fixes the issue and attachments are saved just fine.

A suggested cause of the regression would be the changes from bug 381992.

It should be noted that this has only happened on a queued attachment URL. We have not been able to come up with a usable test-case at the moment (outside of my roaming patch).",1,"0"

Setting a bookmark's Description to be the same its Keyword will make the custom
keyword for that bookmark not work. Erase the Description or change it to
something else and the custom keyword for that bookmark works again.

I stumbled upon this because I thought it would be useful to set the description
to be the same as the keyword so I would remember the keyword easily by just
browsing the bookmark manager.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Bookmark Sidebar or Bookmark Manager

As far as i understand the fix for bug #298255 it was intendet to stop the
ability to load chrome urls from external applications and to clear the context
of javascript calls to about:blank.

Tested with Firefox 1.0.6 and it works as expected: can not load chrome and
javascript urls don't have access to document.cookie (although a
javascript:alert(document.cookie) gives the current domain as title of the alert
dialog instead of javascript application or about:blank).

But by calling a data: url it is still possible to do cross-domain scripting. Is
this expected behavior in 1.0.6 or was this overlooked?

the text reversed (i.e. NS_TEXTRANGE_SELECTEDCONVERTEDTEXT or

But I think the foreground color is set for improving visibility rather than

The plugin is designed to support both translation directions so you can enter either slovak or english term. The system is looking for the term in the English database first. If there's no such term it tries to find it in the sk database.

Having everyone who currently listens to progress listeners for page loads go
through the contortions that the Firefox password manager goes through in the
patch from bug 274784 is not cool.  Right now all you have to do is get a
service or reference to a docshell and register yourself with it to watch all
document loads (globally and in that docshell respectively) whatever we do
should be roughly equivalent in complexity for the consumer.

I still think the simplest solution is to push the mChannel on documents up to
nsDocument (from HTML/XMLDocument) and call OnStateChange with this channel as
the request.  A minor tweak to docshell to prevent onload firing when we do this
should be pretty straightforward.

I created a dashboard chart and then generated and copied a link to the chart.
When I tried to view the chart from the link I got an error in Bugzilla
stating the chart format does not exist with a content type of html.

Clone of bug 458759

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Dashboard report chart. I did Test Run report and Test Results
report with Status on the vertical axis and category on the horizontal axis. I
tried table line and bar charts.
2. Create a link to the report and copy it.
3. Paste the link in a new browser or add the link to a dashboard.
4. Save the report.
5. Attempt to view the report from the saved search tab.

Actual Results:  
3. An error appears in bugzilla stating The requested format bar does not
exist with a content type of html. It did the same for bar table and line.
4. Get a Testopia error stating There must have been a problem saving this
search. I can't find a type.

Expected Results:  
3. Should be able to view the chart from the link.
4. Should be able to view the chart from the saved search.

This was fixed in previous versions of Testopia but appears to have crept back in to Testopia 2.2.

test reporting and status purposes.

"CORE-46077","Tooltips look ugly also tooltip code invalid","Tooltips look ugly cf. MSIE. MSIE's which are smaller and neater look much
more professional. They are also wrong on every platform because they do not
correspond to system values.

Here's the classic code:

.tooltip
  {
    background-color      : infobackground
    border                : 1px solid windowframe
    color                 : infotext
    font                  : smaller
    padding               : 0px 1px 0px 2px
  }

.tooltip > .popup-internal-box
  {
  	border: 0px
  	padding: 0px
  }


modern:

.tooltip
  {
    background-color      : #FFFFCC
    border                : 1px outset #FFFFCC
    color                 : #000000
    font                  : smaller
    padding               : 3px
  }

There are the following problems:

The padding is too big and looks ugly.

All other applications use UI settings there is potential for conflict
(invisible tooltips) and for tooltips that look inappropraite for the system.
Hence change in each case background color and font to UI values.

Border needs to be 1px solid black regardless of settings (this is what happens
in other applications).

Font: smaller is invalid - the font shorthand requires both size and family
(e.g. font: smaller sans-serif) hence Mozilla is currently ignoring it.
However the correct thing to do is to use UI settings anyway.

Here's the new code (both skins):

.tooltip
  {
    background-color      : infobackground
    border                : 1px solid black
    color                 : infotext

I'm using javascript to populate an html table using the DOM functions
createElement appendChild etc. But there is a problem when I try to remove the
rows:
  I first loop in the childNodes of the tbody and remove some of the rows. The
result is immediately visible in the page.
  Then I reloop in the childNodes of the tbody to remove some other rows.
Surprisingly the rows I removed first are still there (from a javascript point
of view) and if I try to remove one of those ghosts I get the following error:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... Node was not found  code: 8
nsresult: 0x80530008 (NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_FOUND_ERR)  location:
http://localhost/functions.js Line: 58]

If I go to the DOMInspector the rows don't appear in the DOM tree but are
still shown in the childNodes of the tbody in the Javascript Object view.

Here is the tree :
table
  tbody
    tr
      td
        input type=checkbox (checked: the row is to be removed)
      td
        text and image
    tr (same as above)
    tr (same as above)
    tr (same as above)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a new file and paste this code:



function removeFromList(tBody){
  n_tbody = document.getElementById(tBody)
  n_trs = n_tbody.childNodes
  n_toRemove = Array()
  for(i_tr in n_trs){
    /* skip the non-tr nodes */
    if(n_trs[i_tr].nodeName==undefined ||
       n_trs[i_tr].nodeName.toLowerCase()!=tr) continue
    /* get the checkbox directly (quick and dirty without checks) */
    n_input = n_trs[i_tr].firstChild.firstChild
    if(n_input.checked==true){
      n_toRemove.push(n_trs[i_tr])

  while(n_tr = n_toRemove.pop()) n_tbody.removeChild(n_tr) /* <-- error here */
}

2. Open the page with firefox select AT LEAST TWO checkboxes and click remove
3. Select another checkbox and click remove

Actual Results:  
The first time the rows are removed
The second time I get a javascript error
--> the DOM view shows 3 lines the Javascript object shows 4!

"RELEASE_ENGINEERING-567154","Configure single buildslave in production to generate nightly Windows 64-bit builds","We've run into a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem with getting the Windows 64-bit builds into a decent state. Without builds and logs (and eventually symbols) for developers to look at we haven't been able to get much help from developers in debugging issues and getting builds to a nightly state. 

Armen has been able to generate a 64bit Windows build so he has a toolchain that works. The build crashes right away though. We don't necessarily want to deploy the current toolchain across a collection of buildslaves until we're sure generated builds are usable.

I'm going to suggest we try something new/different.

After talking with joduinn this morning we'd like to hook up Armen's single Win64 builder to production-master and have it build nightly builds on trunk. By doing this we can iterate on the toolchain as required trigger builds as required and generate builds and logs for developers to use as we go.

Once we have working builds from an agreed-upon toolchain we can scale this up.

We can put the Win64 nightly builds into the experimental/ dir until they (at least) start up. We should disable updates testing etc in the mozconfig to start.",316,"1"

"CORE-68702","Implement inter-process communication (IPC) in Mozilla (protozilla)","Currently Mozilla's interaction with external programs is limited to
launching helper applications to handle certain MIME types and protocols
(even this feature is not fully implemented yet see bug 68406). This is
a one-way interaction in which a detached process is created. However
the process does not interact back with Mozilla. It would be nice to extend
necko so that Mozilla can execute an attached process write to its
standard input and read from its standard output using either
anonymous pipes or TCP socket pairs. This would facilitate the following:

 - writing external protocol handlers that return HTML and other types of
   MIME content back to Mozilla for display in the browser window
   (client side CGI)

 - executing arbitrary programs from Javascript using xpconnect
   and capturing the output of the command as a string.
   (this is similar to the `backtick` feature found in many shells)

These features can be used to add very general protocol handler capabilities
to Mozilla and support the registration of new URI schemes (see bug 68406).

NSPR already supports attaching anonymous pipes or TCP socket pairs to a
process to capture its stdin/stdout. However an IPC implementation must
also allow asynchronous I/O to interact with the process to be able to
run the program without blocking the UI thread.

A working C++/XPCOM IPC implementation is already available as part of the
external Protozilla project (http://protozilla.mozdev.org). This bug is simply
a request by the author of the code that it be incorporated into the Mozilla
CVS tree (unless someone can come up with an alternative IPC implementation).

You can browse the IPC code directly using the following link:
   http://mozdev.org/lxr/source/protozilla/pipella/base/

There are three possible locations where this code could be incorporated:
 - necko
 - xpcom
 - mozilla/extensions/ipc

Since the first two locations would require module owner approval and more
extensive review in the short term it may be better to import it into
mozilla/extensions/ipc and let it bake there for a while. Even if mozilla.org
approves this extension the code still needs to reviewed and super-reviewed
of course. If approved it is important that the extension be normally enabled
for default compilation. Otherwise there isn't that much benefit to it being
a part of the Mozilla code base.

Code issues:

 - interaction with other modules: the code is self-contained and should
   only affect those who start using the new IPC features

 - security: I don't think there are any new security issues associated with
   adding the IPC feature since it is quite similar to the nsIFile.spawn
   method which already allows xpconnect to execute an arbitrary program.
   (Protozilla itself has other security issues associated with the use of
    special URLs which is addressed in bug 68406 but they do not affect the
    IPC component of Protozilla)

 - threading and ownership models: the code was written by someone (me!)
   who only has a limited understanding of how necko and the URL loading
   process work. (Blame the poor or non-existent documentation for this!)
   So it is important that the code be reviewed by a necko expert.",3658,"1"

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.6a1 (20051213) and earlier

Fields in the query string of URIs are meant to be %-escaped. So the following mailto-URL works as expected when passed into TB from a browser (both IE and Mozilla):

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?to=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org and c&d@e.org)

Substituting the to by cc in the query string also still works:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?cc=c%26d%40e.org (gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with cc to c&d@e.org)

However using bcc in the query string results in trouble:

mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org

This now gives a mail addressed to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

In other words TB forgets to unescape the BCC address(es) correctly. Note that leaving the addresses in the query string unescaped is not an option as the unescaped ampersand would prematurely terminate the to/cc/bcc field.  

Outlook behaves correctly in this respect i.e. treats all the above URIs correctly and on the same footing. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure TB as default mail application for IE or Mozilla
2. Enter mailto URL mailto:a%26b%40c.org?bcc=c%26d%40e.org into browser address field or click on a link with this URL 
3. Observe addresses shown in TB mail composer window - the BCC addresses will not be unescaped.

Actual Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c%26d%40e.org

Expected Results:  
I get an e-mail compose window with the mail addressed to to a&b@c.org with bcc to c&d@e.org

This was first discovered in TB 1.0.7 but seems to be the same in the current trunk. Both Mozilla and IE were used as the browsers supplying the mailto-URI to TB. Mozilla in cooperation with Outlook handles the URIs correctly. The problem also occurs when the window.location property is set to the said mailto-URL in JavaScript in the browser. There is no obvious workaround.",486,"1"

"NSS-422859","libPKIX builds & validates chain to root not in the caller-provided anchor list","This bug was originally reported by Kai Engert in bug 406755 comment 37.

He reports that he called CERT_PKIXVerifyCert passing it a set of one or
more certificates to be used as explicit trust anchors and a policy OID
and a cert from a particular server.

He expected the function call to either 
a) succeed and return a chain that was anchored by one of the roots he 
supplied or 
b) fail
Instead he reports that it succeeded but the root CA cert that it returned
as being the matching trust anchor was NOT one of the certs he had passed 
in to the call but rather was one of NSS's built-in trusted root certs.

So it appears that NSS did not use the caller-supplied list of anchors 
to the exclusion of all the other usual trust anchors but merely in 
addition to the usual trust anchors.  

This is bad news for EV.  

I think we should try to reproduce this with vfychain or vfyserv.  
I will attempt to attach to this bug a zip file containing the certs 
sent by the server in the TLS handshake.  

I don't know exactly how many root CA certs Kai passed to CERT_PKIXVerifyCert
but I believe that one of them was the cert found at 
http://crt.comodoca.com/COMODOCertificationAuthority.crt
and the EV policy OID used with it was 1.3.6.1.4.1.6449.1.2.1.5.1

The addition of the new 'mini' calendar is a great idea but unless it can
display a different month from the main window (or multiple months) it's use is
very limited. After all the dates it is showing can already be seen in the main
window.

If this is not thought to be a good idea then the best use for it would be to
bold the days that have events in on any calendar. 

Otherwise I am not sure what the point is (even though I like it immensely :) )

"SEAMONKEY-153525","Allow mach-o build to build on gcc3","I've been working on getting the mach-o build to build with the gcc3
in Apple's April 2002 Dev Tools beta.  Anyway to describe the changes
I have so far in more detail:

-----

The new compiler/linker combination doesn't like linking C++ files
using gcc3 rather than g++3.  This led to the changes in
config/Makefile.in to get asdecode to be linked with $(CXX) rather
than $(CC).  However this is somewhat of a hack (it forces the
same thing to happen to nsinstall which does no harm and it's
Darwin-only) but asdecode should really be in its own directory.

-----

This patch uses ifdefs etc. to port the ppc-rhapsody xptcall code
to gcc3 so that it still works on gcc 2.95.  Parts of the patch
are based on Glenn Nakamura's patch in bug 86446.

TestXPTCInvoke works fine in both my 2.95 and 3.1 builds.

I can easily rewrite this part after bryner lands his patch to the xptcall
code that he needs for prebinding.

-----

The old gcc passed -install_name through to libtool (for -dynamiclib)
but filtered it out for ld.  The new one doesn't filter for ld
(which is used to link -bundle libraries) so we can't pass
-install_name when using -bundle.  However beard thinks this is probably
OK and my 2.95 build still works fine.  (I'm using it to write this
bug report.)

-----

The compiler has one major bug that I need to report.  I've worked
around it a bit but it finally got to one point where the workaround
stopped working.  Some of the workarounds are probably good code
changes that we'd want to check in.  The bug is that the compiler
chokes on non-const static variables in inline static member functions.
I fixed a large number of them by converting hand-crafted GetIID
functions that didn't use |const| to use NS_DEFINE_STATIC_IID_ACCESSOR.
These seem like changes that we may as well check in.  However some of
the changes shouldn't be checked in.

I need to file a compiler bug but ADC login that I created yesterday
didn't seem to work at http//bugreporter.apple.com/ .

Examples of the error messages before these changes are:

/Users/dbaron/builds/trunk/mozilla/xpcom/ds/nsIArena.h: In function `static 
   const nsIID& nsIArena::GetIID()':
/Users/dbaron/builds/trunk/mozilla/xpcom/ds/nsIArena.h:61: nsIID iid causes a 
   section type conflict

/Users/dbaron/builds/trunk/mozilla/js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcwrappedjsclass.cpp:47
4: WrappedJSIdentity*singleton
    causes a section type conflict

The don't-check-this-in changes are particularly in the files:
  js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcwrappedjsclass.cpp
  perhaps the caps changes although I prefer my way...

-----

I'd probably like to get parts of the changes I have so far checked in.
I'll attach a patch with everything I've done and then perhaps split it
into things that I'd like to get checked in sometime later.",32,"0"

Additionally we're using friend definitions where sometimes we don't need to but also I prefer to avoid it especically with the LDAP architecture we have at the moment - it needs some rework (possibly separating nsAbLDAPDirectoryQuery from nsAbLDAPDirectory) as trying to hook in replication and writeable directory to a common code is very hard as it is but that's another bug - this is the start of the rework hopefully.",1,"0"
"SEAMONKEY-208903","download manager doesn't work with non-ASCII file names.","The patch for bug 175881 introudced this problem. (attachment 124826).
The patch has the following line 

-    gStatusBar.label = getSelectedItem().id
+    gStatusBar.label = getFileForItem(getSelectedItem()).path

The noticable change introduced by this is that the status bar shows 'garbage'
characters for non-ASCII file names. Going back to 
|getSelectedItem().id| (chopping off 'file://' at the beginning if necessary)
will solve this 'UI' regression. However that's not touching the root cause of
the problem because none of command buttons is functional (all of them is dimmed
out) when a non-ASCII file is  selected  with or without the change. The file
operation in other parts of Mozilla work fine so that nsIFile and nsILocalFile
are not to blame. [1]

getFileForItem() is defined in 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/components/download-manager/resources/downloadmanager.js#357
as
357 function getFileForItem(aElement)
358 {
359   var itemResource = gRDFService.GetUnicodeResource(aElement.id)
360   var fileResource = gDownloadView.database.GetTarget(itemResource
gNC_File true)
361   fileResource =
fileResource.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource)
362   return createLocalFile(fileResource.Value)
363 }
364 
365 function createLocalFile(aFilePath) 
366 {


I added a couple of 'dump()' statements in createLocalFile(aFilePath) and
printed out |aFilePath).  aFilePath is zero-extended UTF-8. For instance 
U+00A0 (in UTF-8 it's 0xC2 0x80) aFilePath should have 'U+00A0'. Instead it
has 'U+00C2 U+0080'. This symptom suggests that somewhere in RDF-related code
ACString is used where AUTF8String should have been used. 

[1] Recently I've been working on enabling 'Unicode' file I/O in Windows (bug

Split out from bug 646359.

On the other hand I think we were dirtying lines too often in ResolveParagraph (which covered up the fact that we weren't doing it when we should) so the rest of the patch moves the dirtying to points where we are changing or creating continuations.

patch

We see this pattern a lot in the Assembler:

    Reservation* resv = getresv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

getresv() is inlined so it becomes this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    NanoAssert(resv)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

In optimised builds the assert is removed:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv()
    resv = (r->used ? r : 0)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

The r->used test should always succeed (if it doesn't there's a bug which
a debug build should catch).

This patch removes all occurrences of this idiom in Assembler.cpp and
Nativei386.cpp (but not the other back-ends) replacing them with this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resv(ins)
    NanoAssert(resv->used)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

thus avoiding the unnecessary test.  (A couple of the modified places didn't have the assertion but the code relied on resv->used being true.)

Furthermore I introduced resvUsed() which does the assert itself so now 
you actually see this:

    Reservation* resv = ins->resvUsed(ins)
    ... use resv->reg etc ...

I also changed other resv = getresv(ins)... if (resv) occurrences to 
resv = ins->resv()... if (resv->used) for consistency and readability.

I've run SS several times and am seeing a 0--3ms speedup.  I also checked 
the generated asm and it's several instructions fewer for each occurrence

"CORE-264274","support dependent strings in frozen string API","Support dependent strings in frozen string API.

I think it was a mistake not to have added an API for this back when we
originally created nsStringAPI.h for mozilla 1.7.  I'd like to propose the
following pair of methods:

  NS_STRINGAPI(nsresult)
  NS_StringContainerInitDep(nsStringContainer &container
                            const PRUnichar *data
                            PRUint32 dataLen = PR_UINT32_MAX)

  NS_STRINGAPI(nsresult)
  NS_CStringContainerInitDep(nsCStringContainer &container
                             const char *data
                             PRUint32 dataLen = PR_UINT32_MAX)

When a string container is initialized using one of these methods we'll say
that it is not necessary to call NS_C?StringContainerFinish.  If dataLen is
PR_UINT32_MAX then the string length is computed automatically.  Also data
must be null terminated.  (We may want to add a flag to indicate whether or
not data is null terminated in case we also wanted to support dependent 
substrings.)

The two main issues this will improve:

  o  enables support for a more efficient version of the NS_LITERAL_C?STRING 
     macro.  Today one must write:

       #define NS_LITERAL_STRING(x) nsEmbedString(L##x)

     This example of course is limited to platforms where the 'L' prefix makes
     sense but that includes Linux and Windows so it pretty much means all of
     our embedding customers.  Today's solution means a heap allocation :-(

  o  enables support for a more efficient charset conversion when starting
     with a raw character array pointer.  Today one must write:

A child window is opened using Javascript window.open(). When this window is closed using either the OS'es red X button or call to Javascript self.close().  This is not universally true -- some factor in the test code (in the example URL) is doubtless responsible.

If a textarea has a specified max-width or max-height it will no longer respect the box model. Instead the borders and the padding will also be counted in the width. This only happens in Firefox. IE Opera Chrome and Safari still respect the box model.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a textarea and give it a width say 400px with borders say 4px wide and padding say 10px.
2.Create an identical textarea under the first one give it a max-width of 400px
Actual Results:  
The second textarea is 28px narrower than the first one because the borders and padding are now counted in the width. The first textarea is 400px+8px+20px. The second one is 400px.

Expected Results:  
The second textarea should have the same width as the first one 428px. It should still respect the box model.

I noticed this happens with any doctype and on any machine using any version of Mozilla Firefox (I used browsershots.org). Using -moz-box-sizing: content-box does not help. Using border-box or padding-box makes things even worse. Specifying a value for rows or cols doesn't change anything. Also I have only noticed this for textareas div containers for example will respect the box model fine with a specified max-width or max-height value. I haven't tried other elements like input.

This is important because many users might want to give a textarea a max-width and/or a max-height value in order to prevent browsers like Safari and Chrome from resizing the textarea. Since none of the other browsers have a problem with the box model this is bad for the design as the textarea will look different in Firefox.",56,"0"

We have been seeing Warning: Unresponsive Script dialog box a lot in yahoo mail beta and it happens a lot when some cpu intensive application is running on users box and they tries to check mail.

The value of dom.max_script_run_time in FF 1.5.0.2 is 5 second. It seems to be too low compare to what IE offers. Even though user can change it in about:config but it is too hard to tell millions of users to do so.

To compare it with IE:
IE timesout after executing 5000000 statements on current page.

Wouldn't it be a good idea to set dom.max_script_run_time to 60 sec or

fuelIEvents.removeListener removes all listeners for an event. 
For example if i add two different listeners of same event and then try to remove one of them second listener will be removed too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I wrote example code:

var listener1 = {
    handleEvent: function(event) {
	Application.console.log('1: ' + event.type + ' - ' + event.data)
    }
}
var listener2 = {
    handleEvent: function(event) {
	Application.console.log('2: ' + event.type + ' - ' + event.data)
    }
}

Application.prefs.events.addListener('change' listener1)
Application.prefs.setValue('test_pref' 'true')
Application.prefs.events.addListener('change' listener2)
Application.prefs.setValue('test_pref' 'false')
Application.prefs.events.removeListener('change' listener1)
Application.prefs.setValue('test_pref' 'true')
Application.prefs.events.removeListener('change' listener2)
Actual Results:  
After running this code I see in console three lines:

1: change - test_pref
 ----------
1: change - test_pref
 ----------
2: change - test_pref

Expected Results:  
But I expected to see four lines last from listener 2:

1: change - test_pref
 ----------
1: change - test_pref
 ----------
2: change - test_pref
 ----------
2: change - test_pref

I think problem is in filter function in removeListener method.

function hasFilter(element) {
    return element.event != aEvent 
}

in fuelApplication.js will be return false for all listeners of aEvent.",3,"0"

1)  Various JS_JIT_SPEW stuff in jstracer.cpp and jsregexp.cpp uses
    FramePCOffset which is ifdef DEBUG.  Can we make it not DEBUG-only or
    somehow condition it on JS_JIT_SPEW?
2)  jsregexp.cpp assumes that it can access LirBuffer::names ifdef JS_JIT_SPEW.
    But that's an LIR thing not controlled by JS_JIT_SPEW at all.  It's
    controlled by the nanojit verbose_only macro.  In theory that's defined
    when NJ_VERBOSE is defined but just defining without defining DEBUG
    doesn't seem to build (more people making assumptions I think).  Can we
    just wrap the LirBuffer::names access in DEBUG or NJ_VERBOSE ifdefs and not
    worry here?
3)  jsregexp uses VerboseWriter which is also conditioned on NJ_VERBOSE.

I'm not sure whether jsregexp wants to just condition the whole thing on DEBUG instead of JS_JIT_SPEW and be done with it.",15,"0"

"MAILNEWS_CORE-186977","Message folder pane shows folder size in MB but also in kb (all lowercase)","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.3b) Gecko/20021227
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.3b) Gecko/20021227

With bug 173825 a message folder size column was introduced to the folder pane.
Depending on the size of each folder it shows kb or MB. In that other bug
there is no obvious reason why a lowercase b is used for the unit Bytes. So
I think this was an accidental slip and it should be changed to KB.

Four reasons why I think this should be changed:
- It looks odd (see screenshot I'll attach)
- It is the same unit so why use different case?
- b is often used for bits not bytes but from the source I see here it
means bytes
- From lxr I see Mozilla always uses KB for kilobytes (e.g. in the message
pane where the user sees it simultaneously which is even more confusing...) so
it should be used here also for consistency.

(The uppercase K (used everywhere else) should be ok here because it stands
for a factor 1024 (as usual): there is a distinction (that at least some make)
between K for 1024 and (defined by the metric system) k for 1000.)

Although this bug is visible at the front end I chose the back end component
because the affected code seems to be pretty far inside mail. Feel free to
change if I'm wrong...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mail window with some big (> 1 MB) and some small (< 1 MB) message
folders visible
2. Make sure the Size column is shown in the folder pane (the left one)

TEXTAREAs no longer appear properly in the Classic theme.  Scrolling the
scrollbar will cause it to appear in the right place.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with a TEXTAREA in it that already contains some text.

Actual Results:  Vertical scrollbar appears in the middle of the text area.

Expected Results:  Vertical scrollbar appears at the right of the text area.",7,"0"

It should load data periodically thereafter so personas data doesn't go stale for users who leave their browsers running for days.

telliott cbeard: to ensure scalability how often should the extension reload the data?  Is the former interval of half an hour ok or should it be less frequent?

The related question is how often personas data changes since if it doesn't change very frequently then there's no reason to reload it so frequently even if we're capable of scaling to that frequency.",10,"0"

2. Move the mouse left or right to another folder.

The other folder should open but it doesn't.

A couple of things to note: 

You can get the other folders to open automatically but what you do is move the mouse over the opened menupopup then move it straight onto the other folder toolbarbutton at which point it will open.

On a places bookmark build the result is slightly different. You cannot get the other folders to open automatically but moving the mouse over the other folders will at least highlight the toolbarbutton visually. I am unsure though if the places toolbar has the auto-open code for folders though.

When using text zoom (option checked in view menu) and using the mouse scroll buttons to zoom the zoom will be allowed both higher and lower than the maximum and minimum zoom.  Then it seems to realize that you've exceeded the limit and redraws at the min/max or sometimes a step above or below the min or max.

Contrast that to the full zoom which will not zoom outside the limits at all.  It's rock solid.

"BUGZILLA-473646","WebService methods should check list parameters for scalars and convert before use","When a WebService method is expecting a list reference as one of the parameters passed in but the param is a scalar an error occurs when the method tries to access the parameter.

One example would be retrieving a bug using Bug.get if you pass a single bug id as a scalar for the 'ids' param when it is expecting a list you get the following error to the client:

Can't use string (1) as an ARRAY ref while strict refs in use at /var/www/html/bugzilla/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.pm line 151

All WebService methods should either automatically convert a single value to a list before trying to access as list or throw error to the client stating that it only accepts values in the form of lists. These instead of throwing a code
error.

I believe it should automatically convert the values to lists and then just do the right thing. What do others think?

"CORE-76198","Threadpool optimistically kills worker threads","SUMMARY

The threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number 
of threads is greater than the minimun limit.  

The file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads.  During startup 
there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity.  For every file that 
is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool.  The file 
transport sets min and max number for the number of threads.  The current logic 
in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the 
limit. When the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any 
pending requests.  If there are none and there are more threads in the 
threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits.  

Because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool.  The file 
transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant 
threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are 
primarly needed for startup.

Another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any 
additional request that may come in.  

For example:

From a normal startup to ftp://ftp.netscape.com.org there are 73 new threads 
created and 72 threads deleted.  (This is completely insane) After putting a 5 
second wait there are only 13 new threads created and 12 deleted.  This removes 
60 thread creation/deletions.  

Going to http://www.mozilla.org creates 49 threads.  Adding a 5 second delay 
reduces this to creating only 6 threads.

Clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so 
that we don't get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start.

I am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time.  I ran some basic 
timing tests.  On a P3 dual 500 (windows 2k 128mb ram) it take only 2ms to 
create 10 threads. However this is not a accurate picture since creation of a 
thread doesn't really do much but schedules it.  I also looked at how long it 
takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running.  The data indicates 
that it takes longer as there are more threads.  With 3 threads present it 
takes on average 200 milliseconds from the time PR_CreateThread() is called to 
the time the user defined function is entered and does a printf().  Maybe 
somebody here has better knowledge of thread startup preformance.

Scenario is where HTML page has (a) table with border-collapse: collapse (b)
two alternate stylesheets one with no cell borders and the other with cell
borders.     
When switching from the alternate stylesheet with no cell borders to the
stylesheet with cell borders the table borders are not restored.

happens consistently.  [I'll need to upload a simple test case to demonstrate.]

Bug 466756 comment #99

Neil yes the code now limits the depth into the directories into which
it will descend looking for files.  Look for maxDepth in the code.

Perhaps we also need a limit on the number of files and/or immediate 
subdirectories of a single directory through which we will search.

Bug 466756 comment #105
Seems to be caused by this block of code from pkcs11.c:

    rv = RNG_RNGInit()         /* initialize random number generator */
    if (rv != SECSuccess) {
    crv = CKR_DEVICE_ERROR

    if (rv != SECSuccess) {

    return crv
    }

RNG_RNGInit() already calls RNG_SystemInfoForRNG() (via PR_CallOnce no less)!

Looks like a bug to me.  Tested with CVS 1.11 all actions
performed on the trunk:

Does what you'd expect -- checks in a dead revision and moves
the v file to the attic.

Note that a cvs commit here correctly reports Up-to-date check
failed for `foo'.

	retrieving revision 1.2
	Merging differences between 1.1 and 1.2 into foo
	foo already contains the differences between 1.1 and 1.2

Shouldn't it have reported a conflict?

>                                      cvs commit

Commits User 2's text as a new undead revision (ie. state=Exp)
but DOES NOT move the v file back out of the Attic thus
violating this constraint as documented in the manual node
Attic:
	[...] the rule is that the RCS file is stored in the
	attic if and only if the head revision on the trunk has
	state `dead'.

The reported inconsistency between cvs checkout and
cvs checkout -D now follows from this.

Most text editors will save a file by either:

- writing out a new copy then renaming it over top of the old one or
- renaming the old file to a backup name then writing out a new copy

In either case the name now addresses a new inode and this seems to make mozilla sad on OS X.  If I reload it claims that the file is not found.  If I go to the URL bar and press enter it finds it back again.

If I go Back then Forward then Reload it works properly.  This would seem to suggest that something is being cached that gets used during Reload but discarded during Back/Forward or using the URL bar.

It doesn't always happen -- for example if I try it on the first local page I visit it doesn't seem to reproduce.  But if I click a link to another local page replacing that second page will reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two local html files say one.html with an href to two.html
2. Load one.html
3. Click the link to two.html
4. Rename a file over top of two.html or save it in vi
5. Press Reload",988,"1"

Possible fix

Whenever I do complete trunk checkout and build it this makefile is broken (incompletely generated). The problem seems to be @APP_NAME@ variable in the makefile.in on which the preprocessor fails.

The attachment enclosed is my own (probably incorrect) fix for the problem. I don't see @APP_NAME@ in any other Makefile.in file in the tree.

Maybe this is problem of environment build config. However I am not the only one having this problem. This probably happens just on windows platform.",8,"0"

Build Identifier: Mozilla Thunderbird version 1.0.6 (20050716)

Problem first found when developing a Microsoft Access database.
There is a facility to email a list of people from the database. A process reads
every record puts all the email addresses into a variable (varEmail) and sends
the variable to the Email program with this VBA code:

DoCmd.SendObject acSendNoObject   varEmail

The default Email program will open and place all the addresses into the To
line. The user may then complete the email message and send.

This procedure should work with any MAPI compliant email program. It works well
with Outlook Outlook Express and Eudora.

However with Thunderbird Access returns and error message that there were Too
many message recipients. There are in fact about 150 addresses. I can cut and
paste the entire list into Thunderbird's address line it just will not accept
that many addresses from Access. Note: I did not actually send the message - not
wanting to upset all those users. I refer to an already logged bug - 113251
which may yet cause problems with too many recipients.

The process works with Thunderbird if there are not too many recipients eg 50

Also noted by another user: when cut/paste more than 200 addresses Thunderbird
responds with the following message:
The size of the message you are trying to send exceeds a temporary size limit
of the server. The message was not sent try to reduce the message size and try
again. The server responded: Too many recipients.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Issue the VBA code from the Access database
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Error message - Too many Recipients 

Expected Results:  
Inserted all recipients into the To: box

Yes it would be a bit more work for someone who is installing Camino on their second machine but I think that's a worthwhile tradeoff--especially since those users are probably going to go right into prefs and tweak them to match the their usual prefs anyway.

Windows Vista and Office 2007 come with new fonts Cambria and Cambria Math. They are also installed as part of PowerPoint Viewer 2007[1] and the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack[2]. These fonts should be used for MathML if available.

On Windows XP the fonts only can also be installed from the Compatibility Pack[2] using the following in Command Prompt (cmd):

fileformatconverters /quiet /extract:ffc
expand -f:*.tt? ffc\*.cab \windows\fonts

To install them on Linux/Unix use

wget http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/2/2/9222d67f-7630-4f49-bd26-476b51517fc1/FileFormatConverters.exe
cabextract -d ffc -LF*.cab FileFormatConverters.exe
cabextract -d ~/.fonts -LF*.tt? ffc/*.cab

If there are problems with the TrueType Collection (TTC) 'split' it in two:

cd ~/.fonts

required to read the archive format is very small so it helps minimize the

I have a keyword shortcut to search google. So when I type g  I get the
search results from google. When I close and reopen the browser window g
 stops working and starts doing I feel lucky searches on 'g '.
It happens with every keyword shortcut even those without search options.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close window
2. Try keyword search

Actual Results:

Editing existing event or task:
 o does not automatically select calendar
 o even if select calendar manually does not close after 'ok'


In both cases problem is that more than one calendar object can be
created for the same calendar so the two calendar objects are not ==.
Also the calendar.uri objects are not ==.
Instead suggest comparing the calendar.uri.spec strings.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit an existing event or task
2. Calendar is not selected in dialog so select it.
3. click ok

Actual Results:

Hi for me it would be very interesting to get the possibility to map the cf_ custom field to one classification or multiple classifications. At the moment you can just select a single product one some other single options. However for the configuration it would be nice to map a custom field to classifications.

1.See http://servername/bugzilla/editfields.cgi?action=edit&name=cf_customfield.
2.Under the menu Field only appears when: should be the classifications selectable.

Expected Results:  
Under http://servername/bugzilla/editfields.cgi?action=edit&name=cf_customfield the classifications should be selectable for custom fields.
