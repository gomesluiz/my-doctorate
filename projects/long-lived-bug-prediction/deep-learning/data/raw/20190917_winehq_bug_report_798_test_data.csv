Now the game crashes immediately when a new game starts (or a saved game was loaded).
The configuration tool for the game allows to change various graphical options including shader version (1.1...3.0) bump mapping HDR shadows etc. Lowering the detail level to the minimum disabling all effects doesn't help.

If you were to click inside a chat window and then try to click back into for example a terminal window to switch focus it would work for a split second and then the chat window would pop right back up over it. Ie it is impossible to switch into another window via click because the active window won't go away.

It is easy to trigger the problem but I've had a hard time figuring out specifically what steps one must follow in order to do so. However if I have the main steam window and friends list open and a chat window hovering over a terminal and tinker with moving and minimizing / changing the focus of the main and chat windows for a minute or two (and try to click into the terminal) I can reliably cause it to occur.

This occurs from wine 1.5.12 to 1.5.14 and in both Linux Mint 13 x64 and Arch Linux x64 in a used or fresh wineprefix. Occurs on my machine and a friend's machine as well.

Also a lot (most) of the tests had the prefix of where the file resided on when

conclusion

Under Wine using CreateDIBSection 
for a 160*160 4bpp(16color) will result in a 16bpp
(65536color) bitmap creation wich will mislead the following <a href 
= #cmd3>SetBitmapBits. So our conclusion is that something may go wrong 
with CreateDIBSection intepreation of <a href 
= #pfb>Wine.

as the summary says.

The installer prerequisite log dd_depcheck_VC_EXP_100.txt is pretty verbose no need for Wine trace log:

--- snip ---
...
[12/08/1320:06:38] Windows XP x64 Service Pack 2 is required == 
[12/08/1320:06:38] 	This component uses the FileRegVerCheck version check method. It will compare a given version against the version of a regkey on your machine.
[12/08/1320:06:38] 	Registry key being interrogated: HKLMSystem\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows Value: CSDVersion Version: 512.
[12/08/1320:06:38] 	Version on user's machine:	256

[12/08/1320:06:38] Windows XP x64 Service Pack 2 is required == Component to be installed.
--- snip ---

Setting CSDVersion to 512 in 64-bit prefix allows the installer go further.

Wine uses Service Pack 3 for 32-bit Windows XP setting (=latest).
There is no SP3 for the 64-bit version of Windows XP. XP2 is indeed the latest.

For consistency it would make sense that Wine uses SP2 for 64-bit XP indicating highest SP level.

"WINE-4200","map_image() can cause segfault","Basically to make this short (could go into more detail but my knowledge of
the wine loader code is just *ok* not really good):

I was attempting to run a less-than-perfect PE file (seems to be a broken worm)
I  was obviously prepared for it to not run -- perhaps the loader to error out
since it was an invalid PE file (at least XPSP2 believes so -- and I've reversed
other Win32 loader code and they'd error too)) but I got a segfault unfortunately.

I narrowed the issue down to dlls/ntdll/virtual.c::map_image():
1014                memset( ptr + sec->VirtualAddress + file_size 0 end -
file_size )

ptr is ok:
(gdb) p ptr
$142 = 0x400000 MZ\220

VA for the section seems ok:
(gdb) p sec->VirtualAddress
$143 = 49152

.. Same with file_size (i believe) but the issue is with the length of the
memset().

(gdb) p end
$144 = 3815
(gdb) p file_size
$145 = 110873

As you can see at virtual.c:1014 memset() uses (end-file_size) as the length to
zero out.  However (end-file_size) creates a bad value since end is less than
file_size.  By at least C90 standards the length field for memset() is a size_t
 which is unsigned ... etc etc.  I don't really have a solution as I am not
really all that knowledgeable with really what some of the code is doing but
seems that atleast adding an assert() or a test for this instead of blindly
passing (end-file_size) would be a good thing.  Anyway not a major bug but the
loader should tries it's best to at least not crash.

If you need a test file please feel free to contact me at areiter _ at _

"WINE-12052","Flatout 2 dinput_test: crashes if joystick axis mapping is enabled different joystick sensitivity","because Wine currently maps joystick hat as axes (which makes playing IL2 really difficult) I've been trying to use axis mapping. However some applications crash on startup if axis mapping is enabled AND POV is mentioned somewhere.

I'm using Thrustmaster USB (2960623) joystick.
for jstest device information see jstest_info.txt.

Under wine device feels different: joystick seems to have different sensitivity and small unexpected deadzone (which doesn't exist on windows). 

Without axis mapping joystick seems to work mostly fine but joystick hat is being mapped as axes not as Point-of-view control. dinput_test works normally and reports 2 failrues (see dinput_test_normal.txt for log).

When I try to use following axis mapping (to make hat work in IL2):
XYZPOV1Rz dinput_test crashes on second test and hangs while printing backtrace. see dinput_test_crash.txt. For dinput and trace debug data see dinput_test_trace.txt (Aquired using WINEDEBUG+=tracedinput wine dinput_test.exe.so joystick)

With this mapping Flatout 2 crashes after intro movies.
see flatout_2_crash.txt

With this mapping IL2 works fine but doesn't recognize hat controls anyway.

With another mapping:
XYZPOV1
dinput_test crashes in the same way. 
see dinput_test_crash2.txt for details. It looks like crashes occur only when POV1 is included in axis mapping.",53,"0"

A rich edit conformance test posted several days ago shows this behavior:
http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2006-January/023871.html

(One interesting note: A Find done not-whole-word will miss a second
version of the word in a row. Ex.: in blahblah only the first blah is
found while if RichEd20.dll is not loaded the Find is almost entirely
malfunctional. It's possible those issues are partially connected to
some problem with offset position numbers used to start the Find. In
both the control and API the RTB text has a zero-based offset system

plain terminal output

FlatOut2 v1.2 crashes right after starting when DirectSound is selected as sound output in the game configurator (that's the default setting).
Strictly speaking this is not a regression: the game always crashed in former Wine versions as well when Alsa was set to emulation.
Now that Directsound hardware acceleration has been removed from Wine the crash is reproducible 'out-of-the-box'.

Workaround: need to select 'Windows Multimedia Waveout' option in the launcher (instead of the default DirectSound).

I can't reproduce the problem in the demo which is an older version of the game (1.1). The demo starts fine in current git (wine-1.3.29-245-g895b48e) even if DirectSound is selected in the launcher.

Terminal output

I thought I'd see how this old program works with Wine and it turns out that most of the interface is the wrong colors. The program's messages are unreadable because the black text appears on a black background and the rest of the interface is mostly red and black. However it displays correctly if Xephyr is used to run the program at 8-bit color depth. I tried it in an older version and found that this is a regression:

Both the trial and retail version are affected. I'll attach good and bad screenshots of the program shortly.

"WINE-27683","4nec2x: error message and crash when opening 3d window for second time","In http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=12714 a user reported
that on the free app 4nec2x from http://home.ict.nl/~arivoors
If I open the 3d window (by pushing F9) the performance is as is to be expected unless you close the 3d window before closing the rest of the session. You get the following error: 
ResizeWindowed--DX-error -2147467259:E_FAIL and a stop statement afterwards in a separate window. ... 
This does not occur if running Windoz 7 or XP Pro. It has done it for all versions of Wine up to my now 1.3.23. It has done it on Mint 10 Mint 11 OpenSuse 11.3 Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 11.04. My NVidia drivers are latest and greatest.

I verified the app worked properly in win7 and reproduced the problem
in ubuntu 11.04 / wine-1.3.23 / GeForce GT 220 / 270.41.06
by starting the app pressing f9 closing the 3d window and pressing f9
again.  The log shows

Problem:
When WoW is run using OpenGL mode a problem with flickering graphics presents
itself.  On my machine I have also noticed that there is no 3D graphics
anywhere at all.  The only thing rendered on the screen are UI controls menus
and other 2D visuals.


Steps:
Run WoW using the command line above.  Issue is right away noticeable.


Notes:
o A workaround patch was created by someone who seemed to understand the
problem.  The following link will offer a copy of it however the WoW appdb page
contains a posted copy of it as well:

o I have included a screenshot which obviously won't depict the flickering
issue but does exhibit the missing 3D visuals.
o Obviously it is desirable to be able to run WoW in OpenGL mode as opposed to
DirectX as it offers an opportunity to greatly improve performance.",14,"0"

http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_25

I moved it to:
~/.wine/drive_c/Programme/3000AD/Universal Combat/

I launch the game with this command:
cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Programme/3000AD/Universal\ Combat
env WINEDEBUG=fixme-all WINEPREFIX=~/.wine wine C:\Programme\3000AD\Universal Combat\uc.exe

The game has to be launched from the install directory
because otherwise it claims the the config files
can not be found.

After executing the command sometimes a black game window
appears without changing and sometimes it does not.

But the error messages from wine are always the same
and can be found in the attachment.

Can someone confirm this bug or present a fix?",1129,"1"

Mouse capture is important in SC2 because moving the mouse to the border scrolls the screen. This seems to stem from two separate problems. 

Windowed mode: Since SC2 gives you more relative viewing area when running in widescreen mode I tried running in a widescreen window in my fullscreen monitor. However I can't get the mouse to stay inside the screen while playing either with the default mouse capture setting or setting wine to emulate a virtual desktop and using fullscreen mode in SC2. 

Fullscreen mode: When using dual-head mode (Twinview on nvidia) and playing SC2 at the native resolution of one of my monitors the mouse doesn't stay on that monitor. It still jumps over to the other monitor whichever side it's attached to. This is annoying but not as bad as the first case since the mouse is captured on 3 sides.)

The mouse works fine when running in one monitor in fullscreen mode which is the only way to play at the moment.

To reproduce: run SC2 in windowed mode or in fullscreen mode with emulate virtual desktop or fullscreen mode with multiple monitors. Might be problem with the DirectInput emulation but I specified unknown since I'm not sure.",362,"0"

I can confirm the same error occurs with GCC 3.1 and glibc-2.2.4. 
 
It is due to the nameless struct MONITORINFO which occurs in winuser.h. 
A temporary hack is to define -DNONAMELESSSTRUCT in the ole/Makefile. 
Doing this allows the compile to continue until it comes upon the next #include 
of winuser.h.  So far I've found it occurs in tools/bin2res tools/wrc
dlls/d3d8 and dlls/d3dx8 
and dlls/opengl32. 
Defining NONAMELESSSTRUCT in the appropriate .c file that includes winuser.h
also solves the 
problem on a smaller scale.

Many of my games refuse to start on my system due to a recent commit in Wine.

Wine is printing out only
err:seh:raise_exception Exception frame is not in stack limits => unable to dispatch exception
when I'm trying to start any of the affected games (no crash dialog or backtrace is generated).

I'd document them (although I have a script that installs it just fine). This is
actually a rather strange error the installer tries to install MS components it
needs (e.g. MDAC) and then creates an MsiExecuter.lnk file in the StartUp area
of the Start Menu so that the installer will restart when the user reboots (of
course wine currently ignores these files but this may not be true forever).

In any case the weird thing is that under wine both with wine MSI and native
MSI the link references C:\rundll32.exe which of course does not exist. I
looked through the WINEDEBUG=+msi+relay logs and it looks like the installer
is looking in the wrong directory for rundll32.exe (in the case of the wine MSI
it looks in C:\ which is where the CreateProcess in dlls/msi/action.c creates
processes in native MSI it creates the link in the current directory which is
also incorrect) and creates the wrong link. However interestingly in Windows
98 it actually finds the _right_ directory and links c:\windows\system32.exe. I
will attach the two lnk files and the output of:

grep -A 1000 -B 1000 rundll32 log

where log is the (very large) WINEDEBUG=+msi+relay log of running wine setup.exe.

Misha

p.s. since the path is not correct with both wine MSI and native MSI and is
only correct on a native Windows system (I tested on 98 on XP it does not need
to install these components as they are already there so it is not testable) so
I am putting the bug in wine-kernel as this is where file finding and such seems
to be. Please correct if it is wrong.",9,"0"

currently wined3d (I only tested this in ARB mode but it might also affect GLSL mode) the D3D assembler instruction expp is incorrectly translated to ARBvp assembler language.

wined3d takes this D3D asm line expp r3.y r3 and translates it into EXP R3.y R3. Well this isn't working.

EXP is of scalarop type the first parameter being of masked destination register type (masking is used in this case above) and the second parameter (here lies the problem) is of type scalar source register.

Sadly R3 is a vector :(

First of all according to the current MSDN the instruction used above in the source is NOT valid.

See this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb173373(VS.85).aspx

They explicitly state expp dst src.{x|y|z|w} as the syntax.
They furthermore mention:
------------QUOTE---------------------------
src is a source register. Source register requires explicit use of replicate swizzle that is exactly one of the .x .y .z .w swizzle components (or the .r .g .b .a equivalents) must be specified.
------------UNQUOTE--------------------------

Well this comment about the src reg doesn't seem to be valid at all....

Let's just take a look at the original D3D8 documentation (D3DX8 Shader Assembler Version 0.91 <- !!!).

To fully quote this:
------------------------------------------------------
expp

Provides exponential 2x partial support.

Syntax:
expp   vDest vSrc0


Registers:
vDest: Destination register holding the result of the operation.
vSrc0: Source register specifying the input argument.

Operation:
The following code fragment shows the operations performed by the expp instruction to write a result to the destination.
    SetDestReg()
    SetSrcReg(0)

    float w = m_Source[0].w
    float v = (float)floor(m_Source[0].w)

    m_TmpReg.x = (float)pow(2 v)
    m_TmpReg.y = w - v

    // Reduced precision exponent
    float tmp = (float)pow(2 w)
    DWORD tmpd = *(DWORD*)

    m_TmpReg.z = *(float*)
    m_TmpReg.w = 1

    WriteResult()

Remarks:
The expp instruction produces undefined results if fed a negative value for the exponent.
This instruction provides exponential base 2 partial precision. It generates an approximate answer in vDest.z and allows for a more accurate determination of vDest.x*function(vDest.y) where function is a user approximation to 2*vDest.y over the limited range (0.0 <= vDest.y < 1.0).
This instruction accepts a scalar source and reduced precision arithmetic is acceptable in evaluating vDest.z. However the approximation error must be less than 1/(211) the absolute error (10-bit precision) and over the range (0.0 <= t.y < 1.0). Also expp returns 1.0 in w.
The following example illustrates how the expp instruction might be used. 
expp r5 r0
------------------------------------------------------

So the correct translation should be EXP R3.y R3.w

CCing Stefan Dösinger and Henri Verbeet.

I tried to patch this myself but it looks like that expp has to be moved out of shader_hw_map2gl to be able to do such an adjustement (but maybe not?).",1735,"1"

terminal output

Aquanox as well as the sequel Aquanox 2 show a black screen on startup and the screen remains that way (you can hear the sound of the game but can't see anything).
In Wine's full screen mode the game is visible but the screen is positioned incorrectly (the lower right part of the game screen is off screen).
Can be reproduced with the demo version as well.

It is a regression in the git version:

plain terminal output (only built-in dlls)

When launching RC Cars the game exception handler kicks in and displays the following message:
'Hardware exception: Access violation. Exception address: 0x7BC355F5'. 
Thus the game fails to start.

I found out that one of the game options namely 'NET_Init' in the config file (Config.gm) must be disabled and the game will start normally. Unfortunately this makes multiplayer unavailable in the game...

Installing native directplay components via winetricks doesn't resolve the problem.

Maybe it gives a clue on the problem that the game's own debug log file always ends with:
error: IDirectPlay8Peer_EnumServiceProviders() failed

error: _netProvInit() failed

Probably not only directplay is involved something else is missing too.

The demo linked in the URL field can be used for testing the problem but the installer of the demo hits bug #28006.
You need to install the demo with 1.3.22 (or older) until bug #28006 gets fixed.

additional windows which you can send text too.  In Win2k - these windows will
happily stay always on-top of the application itself.  allowing me to work in
the main window and have interesting things which I might otherwise miss because
of alot of action on the main window appear on these sub windows which float
above the application.

However when I run this application on Wine - giving focus to the application
causes it to end up on top of all the child windows rendering them useless to
my needs.

I am thinking that these are not 'standard' always on top windows because if you
have other applications then they will not sit above them.  ie its only ontop
when the application has focus.
fiddling with warnings etc ...
I ended up using this execution line
wine --debugmsg fixme+allerr+allwarn+allwarn-heap Elf.exe
heap warnings come at a huge rate ... and trace ... wow :P

 the things which seem most interesting are
warn:x11drv:SWP_DoOwnedPopups (10024) hInsertAfter = 0000

and
warn:listbox:ListBoxWndProc_common [30066]: unknown msg b029 wp 00000000 lp 00000000
warn:listbox:ListBoxWndProc_common [30066]: unknown msg b004 wp 00000000 lp 43a3d32c

i get stacks of 
warn:gdi:GDI_GetObjPtr Invalid handle 0 as well - but the other 3 messages
appear when i switch focus between the main application and child windows.

The star should be yellow.  Instead it is white and black.

Long story:
this bug makes gmail look clunky.  Here's how to see it in
its natural habitat:

Log in to your gmail account.
(If you need one I can invite you I have 100 invites left.)
The 'star' symbol (a small gif) is displayed in two places:
1) after the word 'Starred' in the left navbar
2) in the list of messages each line in the list has
a checkbox a star (on or off) the name of the sender 
and the subject.  

The star in the left navbar looks fine it's displayed
using a foreground img link.
The stars in the list of messages are displayed using
a css background style and look like crap
and are broken -- you see only an inverse of a star
and the star image itself is not really shown so you
can't tell if the star is on or off. 

You can see the HTML involved if you do a Save Page
grep all the files for star_off_sm_2.gif
or star_on_sm_2.gif and run the matching files
through tidy.  To save you the pain
I have isolated a minimal HTML test and uploaded it to
http://kegel.com/wine/gmailstar.html
This displays the star as a background
in the same way gmail does it looks
like crap under wine but ok under native firefox.",22,"0"

    bind (lListeningSocket PSockAddr (@lAddress)^ SizeOf (TSockAddrIn))

then call AcceptEx
    lPtrAcceptEx (lListeningSocket lSocket ...)

GetQueuedCompletionStatus (lIoCompletionPort ...) signals completion for AcceptEx for an incoming connection (so CreateIoCompletionPort (lListeningSocket ...) works fine) but never signals completion for events on lSocket not even a disconnection.

If I call again
   CreateIoCompletionPort (lSocket lIoCompletionPort 0 0)
after the completion of AcceptEx it works fine.
So AcceptEx as detached lSocket from the IO completion port.

To help reproducting it I created a little command line server BugAcceptEx.exe
Here attached is the code (Delphi) and the executable.

In a command prompt run
  BugAcceptEx 1234
and in another command prompt
  telnet localhost 1234
and press a key

Under Windows it works fine under Mac + Wine the server signals the incoming connection but never signals data nor disconnection.

it works fine

"WINE-25062","popen: the stderr from the child process is (wrongly) redirected to the parent's stdin","When a child process is popened in read mode the child's stdout and stderr are both redirected do parent's stdin which is wrong: only the child's stdout shoud be redirected child's stderr should be the same as (inherited from) the parent's stderr.

In the following example the This is stdout text should be displayd in upper-case: THIS IS STDOUT and the This is stderr should be displayed in lower-case.

Both child.c and parent.c should be compiled executables should be located in the same directory and parent.exe should be executed.

I compiled the example in three different ways:
1) msvc 6.0 using static libraries on Windows
2) msvc 6.0 using msvcrt.dll compilation on Windows
3) mingw using msvcrt.dll cross-compilation on Linux

All three executables works correctly on Windows platforms (tested on Windows XP) while ony the no. 1) woks correctly on Linux + Wine: it uses the statically linked popen implementation from msvc library. No. 2) and no. 3) display incorrect uppercase THIS IS STDERR: they both use the Wine msvcrt.dll.

I think that this proves that the bug is in the Wine msvcrt.dll popen implementation.

Example:

child.c:
----8<----
#include 

int
main (void)
{
  fprintf (stdout This is stdout\n)
  fprintf (stderr This is stderr\n)
  return 0
}
---->8----

parent.c:
----8<----
#include 
#include 

int
main (void)
{
  FILE *fp

  if (NULL != (fp = _popen(.\\child rt)))
    {
      int c

      while (EOF != (c = getc (fp)))
        putc (toupper (c) stdout)
      _pclose (fp)

      return 0
    }
  else
    {
      perror (parent)
      return 1
    }
}
---->8----

I took a look to the popen implementation in wine-1.3.6/dlls/msvcrt/process.c function MSVCRT__wpopen(): all special handling of fdStdErr in case of readPipe seems suspicious to me...

"WINE-3915","Win32 GTK apps are all black when run in WINE (dogfood)","Product: Wine
Version: 0.9.1-winehq-3
Component: wine-gui
OS: Linux (reproduced on both Debian and Ubuntu)
Severity: major (if you need to run GTK apps critical)
Summary: Win32 GTK apps are all black when run in WINE almost no features of
the GUI are visible except buttons.
Description:
I noticed in cross-compiling my Linux GTK apps for Windows (Win32) users that
the apps look good in real Windows but look almost entirely black when run in
Wine. I tried installing a Windows Classic theme in Wine but all it did was
make the Progress Bars flash occasionally visible. [side note: the GTK apps I
tested all also required an unavailable Windows DLL USP10.DLL]

Steps to Reproduce: I cross-compile since I no longer have any Windows-based
development boxes. So I don't know if this also happens with GTK apps natively
compiled on a Win32 box. But regardless my apps do look normal if you run them
in native windows they only have this black-on-black problem when run in Linux
under WINE.

To reproduce you'll need to install the standard GTK Win32 port that most
everyone uses for GIMP and GAIM from here:
http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/

(You may also need USP10.DLL as mentioned above too)

Then just run a GTK Win32 program in wine -- I could send you an executable if
that is easier or you could cross-compile an official GTK Tutorial Hello
World program using these instructions:
https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=30849&group_id=149086

More info on this bug (in fact the request from a poster that I post this here
as a bug) is in this comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine thread:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine/msg/b67c096722232d3c?dmode=source&hl=en

There are a few thing sent out to stderr when I run the app:

@ubuntu:~/Programming/GTKCrossCompile_HelloWorld$ wine helloworld.exe

Atari Trivial Pursuit Unhinged (plus the NoCD crack to workaround SecuRom copy protection) fails to load and shows error **MAIN - Audio device didn't initialize which appears to be a problem in dmusic or dmloader.

Using winetricks directx9 removes this error but creates another two errors (something to do with DataPak) followed by an unhandled exception apparently caused by an Ogg Vorbis problem (there is an ogg.dll that comes with the app).

TI Interactive +ole trace

With wine-1.1.37 after using winetricks to install vcrun6sp6 and installing the TI Interactive trial launching TI Interactive dismissing the trial and registration dialogs and then pressing Ctrl+M (or doing Insert -> Math Box) yields a message box that states:

Failed to create object. Make sure the object is entered in the system registry.

Using native ole32 from the dcom98 redist allows the TI Interactive application to display the TI math palette panel as expected. From the +relay log:

Every time the game gains focus (after an alt tab ...) sound starts back up for a few milliseconds (maybe 150ms) and then is lost again.

There is no rendering nor sound when the game is not focused -- I believe that's intended.

"WINE-30420","pyjamas desktop (python26 + python-comtypes MSHTML.DLL from IE8) fails due to unsupported ReadTypeLib header","amazingly IE8 works.  python26 works.  python-comtypes barfs for the sole reason that (as can be seen below) LoadTypeLibEx fails.

what python-comtypes does is find the dll extract its typelibrary and auto-generates python code which caches all the COM functions.

an strace shows that atl.dll is correctly being located but the fact
that the function fails makes it impossible to proceed.

however - and this is the absolutely amazing bit - if i comment out the line of python code (line 39 below) GetModule('atl.dll') then ALL OTHER GetModule CALLS WORK!

this is just absolutely stunning.  pyjamas-desktop - a highly sophisticated application that relies heavily on python COM bindings to MSHTML.DLL actually bloody well works.

the only other thing i spotted was that in the conversion process one of the GetModule calls threw these errors:

fixme:ole:ITypeInfo_fnGetRefTypeInfo Can't find pRefType for ref 3e8

"WINE-12540","Favourites menu doesn't work as expected","In Watchtower Library 2007 the Favourites menu doesn't work as expected.

First some set up:
1. Open some article
2. Use Favourites menu to Add to favourites
3. Repeat 1 and 2 one or more times.

Now when trying to open a favourite here's the correct behaviour:
1. Open Favourites menu
2. Click on the first added article
3. The article displays in the viewer
4. Open menu again
5. Click on the second or any other than first article
6. It displays correctly.

However something diffrent happens:
1. Open Favourites menu
2. Click on the first added article
3. The article displays in the viewer
4. Open menu again
5. Click on the second or any other than first article
6. Program displays FIRST added article not the one selected.

This behaviour renders Favourites menu useless. It works correctly under Windows XP. It's worth noting that favourites are executed by an external program that comes with Watchtower Library 2007 - WTFavLauncher.exe and the favourites are files located in windows/profile directory with *.wtfav extension. It seems that regardless of which item in menu user clicks WTFavLancher picks always first added file. I have no idea whether the WTLib doesn't pass the parameter correctly or the WTFavLauncher program can't locate the file.
It's also worth noting that executing WtFavLauncher.exe manually with filename of some favourite item as a parameter it works correctly - displays given article in Watchtower Library program.

V501 There are identical sub-expressions to the left and to the right of the '==' operator: ddsd3.lpSurface == ddsd3.lpSurface dsurface.c 272

...
ok(ddsd3.lpSurface == ddsd3.lpSurface    //<==
  lpSurface from GetSurfaceDesc(%p) differs\

  ddsd3.lpSurface ddsd2.lpSurface)      //<==

It very much looks like a typo. I suspect this code should compare the same variables that are printed.

V502 Perhaps the '?:' operator works in a different way than it was expected. The '?:' operator has a lower priority than the '==' operator. url.c 767

...
ok(size == no_callback ? 512 : 13 size=%d\n size)
...

The precedence of the == operator is higher than that of '?:' so the size variable is not compared to the values 512 and 13. The expression is always true as it evaluates either to 512 or 13 which means this check doesn't check anything.

It seems the app wants only version information but additionally passes langlen by reference (.NET code).
Both verlen and langlen ref values get set by MsiGetFileVersion() during first call.
verlen is properly increased by app (NULL terminator) but langlen ref value is ignored by app -> passed again unmodified at second call.
Wine returns ERROR_MORE_DATA because it thinks the app also wants language information passing insufficient langlen leading to app failure.

warn:d3dxof:IDirectXFileEnumObjectImpl_GetNextDataObject Object is not correct

Review the d3dxof trace shows that the parser had been reading the input file into templates until the one immediately before the warn. There were some heap allocation activity when the first line in what should have been the new template should have been detected but I'm not sure if that is expected.

Also after 'git checkout 8a6628aea59f6f7ba0eb85d6a72297bbb72e7b85' the fonts are messed.

and 'git revert 8a6628aea59f6f7ba0eb85d6a72297bbb72e7b85' brings back the original state.

Author of the patch added to CC.
Note: the game needs native msxml3 and d3dx9_36.dll to start properly.

The installer of CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 and 2009 fails as reported in #13042. That bug contains a patch which fixes this problem and allows the installation to continue. However later on it still fails:

err:msidb:get_tablecolumns column 3 out of range
err:msidb:get_tablecolumns column 4 out of range
err:msidb:get_tablecolumns missing column in table LProperty

I have reported this as a new bug because at first sight this looks completely unrelated but if that was wrong this can be closed as a duplicate.

The steps I have taken to see this problem:
- Start with a clean config
- Set mode to Windows 2000
- Install MDAC 2.8 SP1
- Set mode back to Windows XP
- Make the RAD Studio (2007 or 2009) installation disc available as D:\
- Run D:\Install\Setup.exe
- Click Retry once during the automatic .NET Framework installation
- Choose your selection same problem with everything except for the first option (CodeGear RAD Studio) deselected as with everything selected
- Proceed with the installation

It finishes unpacking and I find the unpacked files as for example

and those files look correct or at least the text files that I could check do.

However then it hangs. The installer says Windows Installer on the console I see error messages (look up) and the only action I can take is to click Cancel which also doesn't actually work.

In Microsoft SQL Server Management Express right-clicking on many of the icons in the Object Explorer pane produces a menu.  This works correctly.

The input passed to the original pop-up menu does not correlate to anything I see.  It is definitely not what I selected.

Workaround:  I can select the correct entry by using the arrow keys and Alt-Key combinations instead of the mouse once the menu has been opened.

This problem is new even 1.2-rc1 has it not. FAR manager is a win32 console norton-like file manager wich can be used under wine using wineconsole. Like other two-panel file managers FAR supports own hot keys which not always are the same as the standard hot keys in MSWindows. E.g. Alt+F4 is for FAR not a command for closing but for editing a file. In native MSWindows there are exist two ways to terminate FAR: 1) F10 key causes internal terminating of application with a prompt dialog auto-saving of preferences etc. 2) Clicking on the Close button [x] on the top of the border of console window causes terminating of FAR immediately (that can be useful to preserve default settings etc). Before the last WINE release-candidate the behaviour of WINECONSOLE was the same as of the native MSWindow console and I could quickly terminate FAR using KDE-made [x] button. Now clicking [x] (Standard Close Button on the right-top of KDE window containing WINECONSOLE) causes an emulation of a pressing of Alt+F4. At result the FAR manager does not terminate but opens a current file for edit. That is a wrong behaviour wich can cause different problems for console applications with non-standard hot keys (Maybe introducing a possibility to customize the handling of the standard WINECONSOLE buttons could be also a good solution).",18,"0"

    ddraw: Use offscreen backbuffers.

Before this patch the frame rate in the game menu (press Esc while in game) was limited to <=60. Now the frame rate can reach hundreds. Behavior on Windows: frame rate is limited at 60.

The reason I am reporting this: Shortly after opening the game menu there often is a short but very noticeable phase where everything behaves sluggishly making it very hard to select the desired entry with the mouse.

The sluggishness/slowdown itself may not be a Wine bug since is not a problem when I switch NVIDIA PowerMizer from its default Adaptive to Prefer Maximum Performance. That however is not an acceptable permanent solution on a laptop. Sync to VBlank settings do not change the behavior.

So far I have only been able to observe the slowdown when running the game in Direct3D mode although the frame rate is now also unlimited when running in DirectDraw mode. All observations have been made with Diablo II Lord of Destruction 1.13c.",2376,"1"

Patch doesn't revert cleanly so I couldn't test reversing the commit.

The last lines before the crash seem interesting.
Wine seems to still use the device later crashes in device_resource_released at device->fb.render_targets[i] because render_targets is NULL. Also device->ref is 44003456 what can't be.",20,"0"

In the game it is suppose to show units behind buildings as a solid colour when occlusion is enabled in the options but instead it shows the whole map (not including UI Health Bars etc) as that colour.

I did a regression test and found the following patch :

I am guessing it is the function : CheckDepthStencilCapability() : reporting incorrect information but I'm unsure.",0,"0"
"WINE-26091","Finale 2010 - lines that are supposed to be dashed are solid","To reproduce:
1. Start Finale 2010 and create a new document or open an existing one.
2. Click on the menu option Tool --> Smart Shape --> Dashed Line.
3. Draw the dashed line on your score.

There are a variety of methods to reproduce this this is only an example.  Both on windows & Mac this produces a dashed line but on-screen and when printing.  From Wine it produces a solid line in both of these circumstances (I've printed to both a real CUPs printer and the CUPS-PDF printer producing the same result each time).

While I haven't done a trace I'm guessing it has to do with the brush.  I hope this isn't a dupe I've searched some but couldn't find anything similar.  If it is a dupe and Finale isn't mentioned please be sure and add Finale to the affected apps (probably should be added to appdb as well).",250,"0"

Sometimes it's menus missing only a separator and some of them are probably false positives (e.g. Korean dialogs declares a font while English doesn't. But they probably need to to have Korean characters. However it would be good to have a confirmation). But often these are missing menu items or stringtable entries. This can lead to shell folders (like My Documents) not to be created or empty strings like in http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/attachments/20060816/1a027491/add_app-0001.png .

I think as Wine 1.0 should be a stable release we shouldn't ship such resources. We could try e.g. to add an options to wrc to copy missing strings from English stringtables while for other resources surround them by #ifdef INCLUDE_BROKEN_RESOURCES that wouldn't be set when compiling Wine but would be used be used by the statistic scripts to notify the translators about broken resources.

log file with WINEDEBUG=+tid+mmdevapi+winmm+dsound+oss+alsa+coreaudio

After having sound for a while usually seconds the game Warspear Online stops playing sounds. Just playing a little with the buttons in the menu triggers the issue.
Of course this behavior differs from Windows XP where all the sounds play OK.

Using OpenSUSE 11.4 which comes with Pulseaudio 0.9.22 alsa 1.0.24 kernel 2.6.37 etc.
Using the soundcard from a NVIDIA GT240 which passes the sound through HDMI.

I don't remember having sound problems before (with other apps/games) with this setup. This is my first time trying this app on Wine.

I tried changing hardware/emulation in winecfg and changing sample rate from 48000 to 44100 with no effect (same symptoms).
There is only one sound device selected.

At first I though it was the alsa-plugins bug that it's mentioned in the wiki but I already applied this patch:
http://git.alsa-project.org/?p=alsa-plugins.gita=commith=e1661e3daa22cfed67c4b74099bcd97b433af24b


The game can be downloaded at: http://warspear-online.com/files/warspear.exe
(8MB file)

How to reproduce:
 Run the app click MENU Settings then click repeatedly the top right arrow or other random buttons for a while (try to vary a little e.g. click Cancel then Menu another time repeat).
Every button should make a short sound. After a while clicking buttons the app doesn't make sounds anymore.
 Alternatively play the game for a while. Every skill should make sounds plus there should be ambient noise.

Installing directmusic fixes the problem. No demo for this game. This
is Oddboxx CD version not Steam.


Tested with:
Windows Vista (without Wine) GeForce 9600M GS--the program works fine here

"WINE-1805","InternetCrackUrl incorrectly sets dwUrlPathLength","Hi

During some application testing we discovered that WinE does not correctly
mimic the WinINet function InternetCrackUrl. The real WinAPI sets the
dwUrlPathLength member of the URL_COMPONENTS structure to additionally hold
the extra info of the given URL if the extra info is not requested as a
separate component. Although this behaviour is not well documented by the
Win SDK it is for instance implemented on WinXP Win2000 and WinME and
therefore might be considered to be intended by Microsoft.

The following lines of code demonstrate the problem:

   LPCTSTR lpszURL = _T(http://www.myserver.com/myscript.php?arg=1)
   URL_COMPONENTS url

   // call 1: crack out url path and extra info
   ::ZeroMemory(
   url.dwStructSize = sizeof(url)
   url.dwHostNameLength = 1
   url.dwUrlPathLength  = 1
   url.dwExtraInfoLength = 1
   ::InternetCrackUrl(lpszURL 0 0 
   // dwUrlPathLength is 13 holding /myscript.php

   // call 2: only crack out url path
   ::ZeroMemory(
   url.dwStructSize = sizeof(url)
   url.dwHostNameLength = 1
   url.dwUrlPathLength  = 1
   ::InternetCrackUrl(lpszURL 0 0 
   // now dwUrlPathLength should be 19 holding /myscript.php?arg=1
   // while WinE still sets it to 13

OK it is of course no great deal to write code that correctly runs on real
Win systems and on WinE (2-3 lines did it). But programers who rely on this
behaviour will for example wonder why their applications don't transmit any
HTTP GET parameters when they call HttpOpenRequest with lpszObjectName set
to the URL path component returned by InternetCrackUrl...",521,"0"
"WINE-38988",".NET applications using System.Decimal to float conversion may return wrong results ('VarR4FromDec' divisor integer overflow)","Created attachment 51943
executable showing the results of the code quoted above

The bug was detected on a system as follows:
* Linux Mint 17 64-bit
* Wine 1.6.2 with a 32-bit environment
* orginal Microsoft .net framework installed in Wine (irrelevant if V2 or V3.5 or V4 irrelevant if installed directly or using winetricks)

If a .net program written in C# and running on a system as described above uses an explicit conversion from decimal data type to float data type this conversion sometimes gives wrong results. There is no error message at all but the result is completely wrong i.e. it is not just a matter of rounding. However the result is not always wrong but only for certain numbers (see below).

The same program executed on a Windows system or on a Linux system with Mono works fine. Therefore the program seems to call some functions within the original MS .net framework which are not correctly executed by Wine.

The C# code which demonstrates the bug is as follows:

			// example #1
			decimal d = -0.594059405941m
			float f = (float) d
			Console.WriteLine ( Value as decimal:  + d )
			Console.WriteLine ( Value converted to float:  + f )
			// example #2
			d = 0.605321507761m
			f = (float) d
			Console.WriteLine ( Value as decimal:  + d )
			Console.WriteLine ( Value converted to float:  + f )

A compiled file is attached. Run it on a Windows system or on a Linux system with Mono and it works fine. Run it using Wine with the original MS .net framework and the bug will occur.",21,"0"
"WINE-28325","Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11.0 Standard no longer completes user training successfully","Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 Standard used to run very well but now no longer works at all. 

I am reporting this bug against 1.2.3 because that is the last version that installs NatSpeak although it does not run.

To reproduce:
I have Oneiric with all updates 64-bit. I got 1.2.3 off the ubuntu repository. 
I installed NatSpeak 10.0 Standard. 

Installation seemed to go all right. 
I then tried to do the initial setup. 
The steps for measuring microphone accuracy and the training went well. After that a couple of steps such as training (I check No to that) went by. 

Then it froze. The following two lines appeared on the terminal screen the first was repeated 4 times the second 9.

"WINE-16325","incorrect font rendering for CJK programs","Created attachment 17630
patches in a tar.bz archive

If a CJK program uses ANSI_CHARSET to create font instance text is not correctly rendered the result is that 
some text in the affected programs are not correctly displayed.  This is not a critical problem but I consider
it a blocker for most Chinese Wine users as it happens massively.

This problem is reported and fixed here:

http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4065

However the fix only dealt with a particular program (picasa) and is not a universal fix.  A hack specifically designed for 
Chinese user (codepage 936) is proposed but not accepted because it is not universal.  This patch is based on the
cp936 hack proposed in bug #4065.

The patch has two flavor the first one uses GetACP() to obtain correct codepage to use which is preferred.  The second
will use environment variable WINE_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE if not defined will NOT affect original code flow.  The 2nd
method added a little bit inconvenience for CJK users but maintains maximum compatibility because as discussed
on the Ubuntu Chinese forum there are better solutions which is out of my ability to change:

This makes it impossible to copy anything (mainly text) from ONENOTE to any other app. Same bug has been reported before (Bug 18242) for ONENOTE 2007 but it is abandoned at this moment.

It is because of this bug smoothly working ONENOTE becomes unusable. Strange this is but no such problem occurs with other products such as MS word presentation 2010.

I hope that this bug is fixed ASAP.

The tool extracts installs and starts the kernel service.
Meanwhile the tool issues a request to mark the service for deletion - kind of auto-cleanup.
After that it starts polling of the service status to check if the service is actually running (it is).

The problem: Wine doesn't implement the deferred deletion of active services and removes the service entry while the service is alive (state 'running').
All subsequent service lookup/status requests fail because the entry is now missing from database.

MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682562%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

DeleteService function

Marks the specified service for deletion from the service control manager database.

...
The DeleteService function marks a service for deletion from the service control manager database. The database entry is not removed until all open handles to the service have been closed by calls to the CloseServiceHandle function and the service is not running. A running service is stopped by a call to the ControlService function with the SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP control code. If the service cannot be stopped the database entry is removed when the system is restarted.
--- quote ---

While you're at it ... please add a TRACE to DeleteService():

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob/929d9fb9f79b9ba0b7392215e51a152ec709d62c:/dlls/advapi32/service.c#l1086

I used the 'service' debug channel first and lost some time because I didn't see the the service deletion part (it's only visible if one uses the heavy relay gun).
This would be consistent with other TRACE messages for service API.

Wine log for xdnd

Operating System: Kubuntu 10.04 LTS with KDE 4.4.5 / i386 / nvidia grafics driver

Bug is related to winamp a windows music player (www.winamp.com). Other applications may be affected by this bug.

Problem:
Every File drag and dropped to the playlist-window of winamp will duplicated. It generates double entries for every file dropped to the playlist-window.

Version of wine:
This bug has been introduced since version 1.3x. In wine 1.2 everything is fine.

Details:
If you drag drop a file to the main window of winamp no duplicate entries will be generated. But if you drop a file to the playlist-window (a window within the winamp application) you will get two entries (duplicated). So it seems to me that the bug is connected to how the drag drop code specifies the target window.

I have attached a copy of the terminal output I believe the problem is related to the final three lines of the output (those lines appear when I click on help in the program.)

To Duplicate the bug install the program launch the program on the main menu click Help.
This is a regression.  This bug does not appear in wine version 1.7.12.
This problem is present in both the 32 and 64 bit versions.
I have been spending the last couple of weeks attempting to run a regression test.  I have attempted the test many times running wine in both 32 and 64 bit.  I can get a good install of wine64 compiling from source.  However every time I try to run the bisect I have a problem similar to this one: https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?p=76960.

I will be happy to get the regression test done if I can get a bisected version of wine to run.",493,"0"

Rosanne had processed this app just before I opened it to process.  The result being that the appdb found a duplicate entry: but it was the same app.
(Carelessly) I merged the app with itself this deleted all versions and test data.

A number of possible solution:
1. Apps shouldn't find themselves as duplicates (identifiable by their numeric ID).
2. An error message should appear when attempting to merge an app with itself.
3. It certainly shouldn't delete all objects at a bare minimum.

Better yet of course:  Once an app is processed attempting to process it again should report an error and fail e.g. App already processed.",32,"0"

    wined3d: Just use glBufferSubData() in buffer_direct_upload().
    
    It might seem like a good idea to try to use glMapBufferRange() in
    buffer_direct_upload() but it really isn't. The interesting cases for
    glMapBufferRange() are GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT or
    GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT but the only way for those to be set here
    would be for the buffer to be mapped with WINED3D_MAP_DISCARD or
    WINED3D_MAP_NOOVERWRITE before the buffer object was created. In that
    case the GPU is obviously not using the buffer object so
    glMapBufferRange() doesn't help. On the other hand if the buffer is
    currently in use by the application and neither WINED3D_MAP_DISCARD nor
    WINED3D_MAP_NOOVERWRITE is set glMapBufferRange() would need to wait
    for the GPU to finish using the buffer object while glBufferSubData()
    may decide not to.

It crashes with WINEDEBUG= (access to 0x04030205) and WINEDEBUG=warn+heap (access to 0x55555559) and an assertion aborts the program with WINEDEBUG=+heap.
It crashes when compiling (GCC 4.1.1 from Debian stable) the whole Wine DLLs programs and executables with -O0 -O2 and -O3 so that is probably not due to a compiler optimization screwup.


I've been discussing the issue for a while with Dan and he is able to reproduce the problem.
However all commit a1e4758f... does is fixing two memory leaks. Therefore neither of us feels that the change in this commit should cause a crash. There may be a problem somewhere else. Since it touches the heap subsystem I'm putting severity to major.


While commenting tests in order to reduce the testcase by looking at the traces I found that a crash can be triggered (but not reproducably...) with the single:
test_aligned_realloc(256 512 16)
(everything before and after this line being commented).
Strange.


Attached is a tarball I sent to Dan which contains:
* a script to run the test in various situations. Compilation is not part of the script if you want to run Valgrind you have to edit the location of valgrind to match the location of Wine-improved Valgrind ( http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_and_Valgrind )
* traces created by the script
* I noticed that a 'invalid arena magic' warning is triggered by warn+heap before the crash occurs so I made a trivial patch that adds printing of the invalid arena magic values.
I think it helps debugging the issue by showing the exact kind of overwrite that occurred: 1-byte 2-byte 4-byte which bytes of the arena are affected etc.
With warn+heap (crash) the arena magic is 0x00555555.
With +heap (assert failed) the arena magic is 0x55555555.",8,"0"

The double quotes around the path *are* part of the key and cause the failure when trying to load the proxy (LoadLibraryExW with altered search path).

The error lies in $WINESRC/tools/winegcc/winegcc.c lines 1360 and following. Winegcc assumes that the command line arguments remain quoted as shown in the cmdline above but instead winegcc receives the following as 4th arg --as-cmd=as --32 (as verified with a simple program just outputting the args) so actually the quotes get lost and need to be manually filled in if winegcc starts a script running winebuild.

usually do it by moving the mouse pointer over the MDI window tabs at the 
bottom while a newsgroup is refreshing in the active window.  Switching in and 
out of the application or between MDI windows a few times will usually bring it 
back until it happens again.  I've traced the problem to this patch

problem 1.33 does not.

Interestingly doing the same with Splinter Cell Chaos Theory yields the same result: the splash screen is shown for a few seconds then it crashes.

Tried in a clean Wine prefix for both and installing various winetricks stuff didn't change anything.

Since the servers for Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow have been taken offline and support has been halted the game's multiplayer mode isn't really worth a lot right now (only LAN mode works). In such circumstances would it be acceptable to upload it somewhere for devs to download it? The multiplayer part of the game is a standalone package free of CD protection and everything.

Also this explains the slowness of the game. With ground I mean the grass and hills which are basically just one big surface. However the textures of the buildings and trees which are complex 3d models are looking great.

In the console there are some of these messages:

Now that bug #8433 has been fixed the game can get past the initial loading screen without crashing but the screen is not refreshing after the loading screen is displayed. You can hear audio playing and various text is displayed (overwritten) on the loading screen.
At some point menu options appear at the bottom of the screen and you can start a new game by pressing . You can hear audio from the game but the screen is still showing the corrupted loading screen.

Setting OffscreenRenderingMode to backbuffer acts as a workaround. One of the drawbacks of this setting is that the opening screens showing the graphic card and input setup are displayed upside down. Once the game begins to load the screen is displayed normally.
Performance is abysmal when you start a new game but I don't know if this is due to the backbuffer setting.

No suitable graphics card found.

The device creation parameters contain invalid configuration options.

This program requires pixel shader 1.1 and vertex shader 1.1. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doesn't really reveal anything. So i decided to give a simpler xna game a try: 

http://www.phstudios.com/tutorials/xna/Paddles/Paddles.zip

Running this gives a lot more info in the console:

Unhandled Exception: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException: The device creation parameters contain invalid configuration options. ---> System.ArgumentException: The selected MultiSampleQualityLevel value is invalid for the selected MultiSampleType.
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.ValidateGraphicsDeviceInformation(GraphicsDeviceInformation devInfo)
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.CreateDevice(GraphicsDeviceInformation newInfo)

So the  The selected MultiSampleQualityLevel value is invalid for the selected MultiSampleType is apparently the bug. 
That's bug one then.

I can only do stupid hacks the hack 1 attached  gets the game a bit further. It then crashes with:

Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: The device name is not valid. Device names are in the form \\.\\DEVICE1
Parameter name: screenDeviceName
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.WindowsGameWindow.ScreenFromDeviceName(String screenDeviceName)
 
Apperently it's not happy with what wine returns for ScreenDeviceName. It expects something like \\\\.\\DISPLAY1 i think wine returns something like
\\.\\DISPLAY

With the hack/patch 2 the paddles game starts fine then.

The other Infimer game also gets further with the two patches but then halts at a sound error and still doesn't run :(. If a directx developer could have a look and fix this that'd be nice i think these bugs will affect all xna games",9,"0"

When in-game anti-aliasing is enabled water is not rendered properly in the King's Bounty games. Reproducible when the player is on the adventure map and some water is nearby. When water quality is set 'normal' then water textures are completely messed up (see attached screenshot). When water quality=high then water looks a bit better but still not correct.

Can be reproduced in KB: Legends demo. The game needs native d3dx9_36.

Reverting the following commit fixes the issue:

Hi

When i launch EA Origin when Wine is set to Win7 the picture in Games tab or Shop tab don't display correctly.

I attach to screenshot 1 wine Origin with XP mode and the second with Seven mode.

Concerning the output i don't attach them because it's the same for both but i have only these message when i launch Origin with Seven mode :

 Uninitialised value was created by a stack allocation
   at  test_typelibmarshal (tmarshal.c:762)

The problem happens during a call to this method
where widget is a pointer to an uninitialized pointer
which will receive the pointer to the widget:

   interface IKindaEnumWidget : IUnknown
   {
       HRESULT Next(
                    [out] IWidget **widget)

I discovered that the attached patch prevented the problem.
I don't quite understand why at first glance
widget is an out parameter from the function
why would it be dereferenced while serializing
the call?

It's a bug in the typelib marshaller. It doesn't check whether a
VT_PTR type is actually an interface pointer and not access it on
input when the parameter is an [out] parameter. Note that because of
the memory re-use semantics it is legal to access memory passed in to
a remote function even when the parameter is [out].

I think it's getting close to the time to reimplement the typelib
marshaller on top of NDR functions so that we don't have to implement
these subtleties twice would improve performance and would reduce the
amount of code.

It might take a while until all required packages are downloaded using BITS.

Note: If you need to redo steps backup the directory dotnetfx304506.30 from
c:\\windows\\temp to a different location remove ~/.wine copy
dotnetfx304506.30 again to c:\\windows\\temp to prevent BITS from
downloading over and over again.

That GetServiceKeyNameW() API failure seems to be ok because the app passes the key name itself idsvc and not the service display name.
The following GetServiceDisplayNameW() also fails leading to app error/exception.

If you look closer you see svcctl_GetServiceDisplayNameW (Lidsvc 1) -> buffer length 1 passed.
This is clearly not what the app intended.
The app reuses the length parameter from GetServiceKeyNameW() passing it again into GetServiceDisplayNameW() but Wine changed it to 1 which seems incorrect.

--- snip programs/services/rpc.c ---
DWORD svcctl_GetServiceKeyNameW(
    SC_RPC_HANDLE hSCManager
    LPCWSTR lpServiceDisplayName
    WCHAR *lpBuffer
    DWORD cchBufSize

    entry = scmdatabase_find_service_by_displayname(manager->db lpServiceDisplayName)

    {
        *cchLength = 1
        err = ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
    }

    scmdatabase_unlock(manager->db)

    if (err != ERROR_SUCCESS && cchBufSize > 0)
        lpBuffer[0] = 0

    return err

This doesn't look right a conformance test case should reveal the correct behaviour.
I already verified this with a patch.

I'm trying to play System Shock 2 under wine.

I have an Ubuntu 11.04 machine running wine 1.2.3.

Everything works perfectly except that the sound fails immediately after the first loading screen (at the recruitment level)

I've had it work once every other time it's failed.
Game stability seems to be related to level of logging enabled for instance:

WINEDEBUG=warn+all causes the game to crash during the intro video (usually fine video and audio)

WINEDEBUG=-all+dsalsa does not although sounds does of course still fail.

I also included this which is the highest level for +all that works:

"WINE-2486","Anchors property not emulated with Wine!","Hi all

I created a simple application with Delphi and realised that if I set the
Anchors property to auto-align a component to 'grow' each time a the window
was Maximized or Resized Wine couldn't do this... In result emulating my
program with Wine I could not Maximize or Resize the form!!!

The Anchors property on Delphi has the capability to set an anchor in
four ways (Top Left Right Bottom) so that if I set a anchor at the top
and at the bottom resizing the window vertically would automatically resize
the component to fit the window!


I will try this on the new realesed version but I don't think it will work.

Maybe somebody knows exactly which DLL dependencies I should set? Could 
somebody post a sample 
~/.wine/config that is known working with Terragen 0.8.44? So far debug does not look 
like it is 
throwing the final error message any ideas? Is Xwindows v3.3.6 okay? Terragen 
0.8.44 and DCOM95 are 
now installed. Terragen loads in both of the following cases:1) Using builtin comctl32 
the 
left-column child window select buttons are not all visible just part of the first one. In 
the 
Landscape child window the terrain-sculpting buttons do appear with good icons 
but 
funny text (that text was supposed to be Small Med Large I think).2) Using native 
comctl32 the left-column child window select buttons are all properly visible. But in 
the Landscape 
window the terrain-sculpting buttons do not appear at all. In both cases there is 
another problem - 
I think it is a general case. From the Landscape child window click Surface Map then 
in Surface 
Map click Edit ! 
 
Color then wine Terragen just locks-up. Landscape -> Surface Map -> Tex same 
lock-up. 
Cloudscape -> Edit Cloud Color same lock-up. Water -> Edit Diffuse/Transparent 
Color same 
lock-up. Killing the wine Terragen process seems to be the only recovery (back to the 
console). All 
the rest seems working fine including nice rendering. So if anybody has the .srf file 
format spec in 
full detail that alone might be enough.

Researching the main issue - the application startup problem. 
The problem occurs because application tries to create a COM object using not 
registered class ID. This is a class ID from the OLEAUT32.DLL provided with the 
application. You can fix the problem by registering the dll. 
To register the dll run command: 
regsvr32 OLEAUT32.DLL in the application directory. 
Try to do this instead of installing and using additional dlls.

same procedural content engine and pretty much all of them function as intended
and don't exhibit that bug.
Essentially:
1-upon starting the render window is correctly dimensioned as full screen (800x600)
2-after content generation bar reaches completion 3D starts running in full
screen correctly
3-after the first screen blackout the render window is truncated on the left
(+-20% of screen) and bottom (+- 30% of screen)

Playback goes well anyway only minor defects such as overly strong HDR-like
effect and some missing fonts in the background (but only some - this may come
from a build defect as other fonts appear)

Problem occurs in both GLSL and ARB modes (they seem identical otherwise). It
has been made for Geforce2-level hardware.

It once seemed to be very sensitive to sound emulation (required OSS driver
emulation) but now works with ALSA with 'standard' acceleration.

No error message in console when the bug occurs (only thing appearing is the
frame buffer size stub - making available RAM 128 Mb changes nothing) - as such
I guess it's not a missing function but rather a bug in an existing function.",1142,"1"

Log of UnrealED session

Now that bug 7451 is fixed it is possible to start the unreal editor.  Everything works... except for any kind of viewport manipulation (which is done by clicking and dragging in the viewport with various combinations of shift control etc.)  As a result it is impossible to use the editor because you simply cannot see all parts of the map nor move things around in the viewports.

It is however possible to subtract a cube and then apply textures to the surfaces that are initially visible by clicking on them in the viewport.

This may affect other versions of the unreal editor but I am not sure.

The attached log was output when starting an unrealed session attempting to click and drag on the main viewport then quitting.  However all of the log messages were output before I touched the viewport.",2015,"1"

"WINE-37096","Problems with DC Universe Online and Virtual Desktops","Created attachment 49318
Comparison of wine 1.2 and 1.7.24

DC Universe starts itself up in a multi-stop process using a launcher. When Play is clicked on the launcher the game appears to start in a blank dos window that changes to full screen. Then a screen appears where one can select or create a character. Pressing play here begins actual game play.

To install and run DC Universe requires winetricks xact ie8 vcrun2005 vcrun2010

My machine is a core i5 desktop with radeon graphics (catalyst 13.35). I run opensuse 13.1 KDE with three virtual desktops which I switch between using ctrl-f1/ctrl-f2/ctrl-f3. 

For stable play the game has to be run using the Emulate Virtual Desktop option from winecfg. Behavior (or misbehavior) changes using recent wine versions. I am attaching an annotated log file comparing wine version 1.2.2

Summary

with wine version 1.2: if one does not run emulate virtual desktop the launcher appears and pressing play results in a minimized game window. If you open the window right away it is blank and if you don't open it right away you'll eventually know when the game is ready to play because you'll hear the music played at the character screen. Then you can maximize the window and play but switching virtual desktops caused the game to crash. With emulate virtual desktop selected in winecfg and set to full screen you can see that the launcher opens what appears to be a dos window (minimized). Opening it gives a blank window until the full screen game starts. If you leave it minimized you can always see the minimized window icon even after the full screen game starts (does not interfere with game play). 

With more recent versions of wine:
With emulate virtual desktop off in winecfg the game launcher will appear and pressing play will cause the game to start minimized just like in 1.2 but if you don't open the minimized window the game will freeze and crash. With emulate virtual desktop on the game will start normally and run will but will freeze when switching KDE virtual desktops.

"WINE-10437","Altium Designer crash","I'll describe all my movements - step by step.
1. I installed latest (at the moment) wine-0.9.49 from sources on Fedora8.
2. I installed my application of interest - Altium Designer 6.7
3. Tried to run it wihtout luck.
4. Found in appDB some hints and installed using winetricks dcom98 fakeie6 mdac28 corefonts tahoma cc580. All installations went well.
5. I tried to run Altium Designer again and it started but crashed when trying to open any file. 
6. AppDB tells that it was tested with wine-0.9.35. I decided to try it.
7. Uninstalled wine-0.9.49 and installed wine-0.9.35 from sources.
8. I did not change drive_c as it was installed previously with 0.9.49. Now tried to run Altium Designer. And oh wonder! I can use it wihout any visible problems.
9. I decided to find out - which version of wine caused the problem. I tried one by one all versions from 0.9.35 to 0.9.43. Works just fine except some minor problems which I can live with. The version which causes problem is 0.9.44. All subsequent versions also have this problem.

Now to the description of behavior.
1. Starting the application like that wine c:\Program Files\Altium Designer 6\DXP.exe
2. I see splash screen and log of different components loading on it.
3. Application windows is opening and I can select to open or create new file.
4. On whatever type of file this operation causes applcation to freese for 20 seconds then I see in the wine log endless list of 
err:region:CombineRgn Invalid rgn=(nil)
err:region:CombineRgn Invalid rgn=(nil)
err:region:CombineRgn Invalid rgn=(nil)

This continues for 3-4 minutes.
After that I see in the wine log following:

5. I tried to look at the sources but as I am very new to wine I could only get to the source of this endless CombineRgn errors. It comes from /dlls/gdi32/region.c file. Particularly function CombineRgn makes it. I could not find a function which calls this function.

to separate two different issues from bug 44641

Technically it was https://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commitdiff/f07e8ca8f01106b6d41a933f0ac393b30d505bad (ntdll: Fix RtlCheckRegistryKey when called with empty path.) which returns 'STATUS_SUCCESS' now causing the driver to execute a different code path not calling 'ntoskrnl.exe.RtlCreateRegistryKey' at this point.

Bug 44641 is about missing 'ntdll.RtlCreateRegistryKey' API -> fixed by https://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commitdiff/535419a2bf8da3fd21cfdede44bf51026a97b94d

'file->state' was already set to 'installed' in the file install part (main loop of 'ACTION_InstallFiles') hence the global .NET assembly installation part is not executed due to line 441/442 or condition. 

With that part fixed the installer succeeds.

After some archaeology I found it mentioned in the mailing list: 

https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2015-August/

https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2015-August/141306.html ([PATCH v2 16/22] api-ms-win-crt-private-l1-1-0: Add stub dll.)

--- quote ---
...
Since MSVC 2015/Windows 10 the C runtime has now been split into two
parts ucrtbase which is the generic C runtime which is now considered
a system component (in Windows 10 and as an extra installed runtime
component for older Windows version) and vcruntimeX which is specific
to the compiler version.

This uses the msvcrt implementation just like the earlier msvcr* DLLs.

Functions with names that existed in msvcr120 are hooked up so far.
---
This is updated based on ucrtbase.dll from Windows 10 RTM.
---
--- quote ---

https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/en-en/windows/release-info.aspx

Windows 10 RTM -> Version 1507 (RTM) -> my guess it's OS build 10240.16xxx where the initial dump information was generated from.

https://www.opendll.com/index.php?file-download=api-ms-win-crt-private-l1-1-0.dll&arch=32bit&version=10.0.10586.212&dsc=ApiSet%20Stub%20DLL

-> 10.0.10586.212 shows these imports/exports so it's likely the API set was updated in Windows 10 Version 1511 (OS build 10586)

That's why I like have tickets (preferably with exact information on origin) when new (stub) dlls are added to avoid wasting time for this kind of research.

    ole32: Store the location of all blocks in a big block chain in memory.
    
    A big block chain is a linked list and we pretty much need random
    access to them. This should theoretically make accessing a random
    point in the chain O(log2 n) instead of O(n) (with disk access scaling
    based on the size of the read/write not its location). It
    theoretically takes O(n) memory based on the size but it can do
    better if the chain isn't very fragmented (which I believe will
    generally be the case for long chains). It also involves fetching all
    the big block locations when we open the chain but we already do that
    anyway (and it should be faster to read it all in one go than
    piecemeal).

Reverting that patch fixed the problem. BTW I also verified that this old version of IE still works properly with a more modern native hlink (from XP).

Steps to install IE3 and see the problem:
1. Run iexplore -unregserver
2. In winecfg add global overrides for some core IE libraries:
iexplore.exe jscript mshtml shdocvw urlmon wininet
3. Add a new application on the applications tab - infinst2.exe - and set shell32 to disabled for this executable.
4. Run the installer leave all settings at default and allow it to restart at the end.
5. On the first run of IE disable the default browser check. It will then crash from an unimplemented function.
6. Run the browser a second time and there should be no crash (just don't try to use the address bar or home button). Click any of the links on the WineHQ homepage and nothing will happen.",160,"0"

because it has a check for a 3D card before launching it's impossible to use in a windows virtual machine... but thanks to you Wine devs I'm able to use it within an Ubuntu VM

actually I was able :(

emulation as never been perfect : perfct menus but ingame textures are completely wrong (a mix of very flashy colors for the area and only black for the player) but the game was launching and somebody knowing the game could play it

but since the last Wine upgrade the game can't launch (black screen then a windows like text box telling me to report the crash if it doesn't crash the same in a real windows OS

I'm sorry if this is irrelevent and if my explanations are quite confused

Any help or tip is welcomed and if I can give you more details just tell me what to look for and I'll send it to you

"WINE-37527","Multiple games and applications fail to connect/login via SSL reporting 'schannel failed to setup sequence detection' (Desura client Darkfall ARMA II multiplayer)","Hello folks

found this while trying out Desura client for Windows.

The Linux client was discontinued/broken some time ago hence this might be useful for the 5 users left wanting to play with an up-to-date Desura :)

A quick search turned up some more hits on this error:

Desura -> https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=22986

--- snip ---

I left out multiple non-failing 'InitializeSecurityContextA' calls denoting different connection stages/phases.

The failing call to 'ApplyControlToken' returning 'SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION' is mostly harmless.
The last call to 'InitializeSecurityContextA' -> 'schan_InitializeSecurityContextA' also fails returning 'SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE'. .

That's on the connection/protocol tear-down path (SSL close notify message).

fContextReq = 0x811C -> ISC_REQ_STREAM | ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY | ISC_REQ_CONFIDENTIALITY | ISC_REQ_SEQUENCE_DETECT | ISC_REQ_REPLAY_DETECT 

Unfortunately the failing protocol sequence on tear-down path wasn't even responsible for the problem.
It took me some good hours to debug this out as the error code is internally maintained and propagated through some objects until the C++ exception is finally raised.

At one time during SSL connection sequence the client code checks if the required context attributes are met.
It specifically looks for 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' while Wine returned 0x100 ('ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY').

You need to handle (return) more context attributes at least 'ISC_RET_SEQUENCE_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_REPLAY_DETECT' 'ISC_RET_CONFIDENTIALITY' 'ISC_RET_STREAM' in addition to 'ISC_RET_ALLOCATED_MEMORY'.

I tested a fix and it allows to login with Desura visit market place download games etc.

"WINE-168","Mouse and Keyboard input die upon entering game Snood","I'm trying to run a game called Snood under Wine version 20010112 patched up 
to the CVS release on Jan 29 2001 using the latest patch from transgaming.com. 
(Snood is available from www.snood.com). The install uses the latest install 
shield and doesn't work yet however I've taken an installation from another 
computer and loaded this into my wine directory. If I attempt to run the 
Snood.exe program using anything other than an artificial windows desktop then 
the main window that is presented (after you close the shareware registration 
window message) is entirely black and while the menus work fine there is no 
way to get graphics. With a virtual desktop however the graphics appear fine. 
However after closing the shareware registration window message the main 
window then has it's borders disappear (they are still there they just go 
black). When you click on the button for new game it usually brings you into 
the game. You then will usually be able to fire one shot. At this point in 
time you will notice a slowdown in the game and then any key/button presses 
will cease to be passed on to the program. It still captures pointer motions 
it just no longer recognizes button presses. I'm sorry for the length of this 
report however it's an odd bug to me it seems. If I can provide any further 
information for you please don't hesitate to email me at either 
akmed@iname.com or the address that forwards to mm4692@albany.edu. Attempting 
to use the base 20010112 installation only freezes the game altogether not 
allowing it to enter in to any sort of useable state. Thank you for your time. 
Even hints as to how I might further debug this would be appreciated. I 
attempt to turn DXGrab both on and off however neither mode works and in both 
methods I can move the mouse outside of the window. I'm using XFree 4.0.2 
compiled from source. I'm using a Voodoo Banshee video card and a PS/2 port 
mouse along with a standard US 104 ps/2 keyboard. Thank you

that this app appears to hang at the splash screen.
To reproduce install the following two binaries:
ftp://ftp.gsn.de/pub/prg/WIN32/BDE/BDE32.EXE
ftp://ftp.gsn.de/pub/prg/WIN32/AUFTRAGSQL/winauf32sql.exe
and start the app.  The apparent hang is really a z-order
problem two dialogs pop up behind the splash screen.
To see the text start the program with 
  WINEDEBUG=+text wine gsauftrag.exe 
The first dialog is a question about whether to import
the example data or something I got past it by pressing the J key.
The second dialog is a warning about printers:

ein Treiber installiert werden selbst wenn kein Drucker vorhanden ist.
Installieren Sie einen beliebigen Treiber in der Systemsteuerung.
I got past it by pressing the Enter key.

The app then appears to start properly but then puts up an error
window saying

in the log.
The next thing to try is probably installing ie6 for real
and see if this goes away.  Easiest way to do that is
either use ies4linux or Codeweavers Crossover.  If that
makes this problem go away I probably guessed right

"WINE-38980","World of Warships/Planes/Tanks client in torrent download mode crashes spuriously on high bandwidth load (i/o completion ports)","Hello folks

while checking out some 'World of Warships/Planes/Tanks' issues I've seen this turn off torrent downloader to avoid crash note multiple times in WineHQ appdb entries and also on various Internet sites.

Although this workaround solves the actual client download/updater problem it seems no one bothered to report this here for some years?

I could reproduce crashes with all 'World of WarXXX' clients using the torrent download mode.
The crash is caught before any registered JIT debugger ('AeDebug') as the client installs a top level exception filter.
Upon failure it simply displays a message box with the option to restart the download client.

The client makes extensive use of I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) with a considerable number of worker threads (thread pool) for servicing them.

Although the crash occurs kind of randomly the crash site seems not.

I partially reconstructed the call chain for the crash site:

...
WoWSLaun.unsigned int __stdcall boost::asio::detail::win_thread_function(void *)
--- snip ---

I found some hints in the launcher about the Boost library version used:

--- snip ---
e:\work\5c6ecc6fb8b7976a\libraries\boost_1_54_0\boost/exception/detail/exception_ptr.hpp class boost::exception_ptr __cdecl boost::exception_detail::get_static_exception_object(void)   -   e:\work\5c6ecc6fb8b7976a\libraries\boost_1_54_0\boost/exception/detail/exception_ptr.hpp
...
--- snip ---

Which leads to:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/boost/asio/detail/impl/win_iocp_io_service.ipp

There is a number of internal calls in between the crash site and Boost IOCP code ('op->complete()' -> 'win_iocp_operation' + function pointer call hierarchy).

Debugging/relay tracing a problem which seems to occur at random times in a multi-Gigabyte download also requiring high download speeds is not really funny :|

Anyway it's now documented here for reference.

It would be interesting to know if this torrent download problem occurs on Windows too albeit much less frequent.
Reading up some forums I got the impression...

Hi a user reported failing installer on the forum:

First it needs srclient i add patch for stub dll here.

Then it still fails it`s only happy if SRSetRestorePointA returns TRUE. This might however cause regressions (?).  I guess this needs more tests. Maybe we could return TRUE and set nstatus to ERROR_SERVICE_DISABLED. But as said needs more tests

"WINE-11729","Unreal Tournament: dinput mode makes game unplayable","Hi there

new Unreal Tournament bug after the error on exit bug was fixed. This one is different however because it has to do with input.

The problem is that once you active direct input in the UT configuration menu and restart (so the change becomes active) the input sort of stops working.

What exactly happens:
I'm currently not talking about being in-game. I'm just in the menu where you land after pressing ESC in the intro sequence. Upon pressing ESC you end up with the cursor in the upper left position on the virtual windows (currently using virtual desktop so debugging is easier).
The first entry of the game menu is opened automatically (Game) and I can now move the cursor through the opened game entry selecting the children. Or I can move over to the next entry (Multiplayer Options Stat Tools ...) and select children there.
OK this is when dinput is OFF.

Now I go into the options activate dinput and leave the game. Then I start the game again and encounter this.
Upon pressing ESC the cursor is still transferred to the upper left position and the menu opens.

What is different:
When clicking the menu away (click on non-menu components) and then trying to open them again (by clicking on them) the menu item won't open (no drop-down effect). I can hear the soundeffect of the menu opening but nothing more. I can even click something (suspecting that the menu is invisible but there). So the only thing I can do is switching the app to window mode (there is a button in the upper right corner that does that) and then use the X-button on the window to close the application.

Another difference is that marking checkboxes doesn't work anymore. I was going to make another try and restarted the app this time moving right into the config menu to deactivate input. This works because ESC always lets the menu pop up. However removing the tick from the checkbox proved to be impossible.

I had to modify the UnrealTournament.ini to switch dinput off.

I created a log from the dinput run going to attach this.

Finally the main menu appears but the screen stays frozen (not refreshing) at this point. The game is still running audio and keyboard work but all I can see is the frozen main menu.

In the demo the game starts with a black screen and the screen stays that way: normally various splash screens should be displayed then the menu should appear but you can only see a black screen. The game is running fine you can hear the sound effects keyboard also works.

When it doesn't work it's broken from the very beginning. At the Sierra intro movie it will not have any sound. Then there will not be any sound throughout the running of the program. There are no other noticeable issues during play. But also when this happens upon a normal exit of the app via its menu system it will normally (always?) hang in the console window after it closes its application window. In the few cases when there is sound upon startup exiting normally does not hang.

Choosing different audio drivers in winecfg seem to have any affect. 

Running 'wineboot -s' or 'wineserver -k' doesn't seem to help either.

For a while it seemed like switching the default settings Windows Version in winecfg back between 'Windows XP' and 'Windows 2000' would help but usually not. Probably just a coincidence though as sometimes it will run fine anyway and it certainly doesn't work every time.

"WINE-12298","Notation Composer: crashes when opening menus when using ALSA","Created attachment 11746
Backtrace

I am trying to run the demo version of Notation Composer 2.3.3 (a midi notation program). It starts just fine but crashes when I start opening menus like File Help and so on. If I use the menus sparingly I am able to open a midi file and use some of the basic program functions like playing the file or editing the score (although my toolbar lacks icons and playback bogs the program down... topics for separate bug reports probably but perhaps that info will be useful here).

The demo can be downloaded here: http://notation.com/download/NotationComposer233TrialSmallSetup.exe

Note that I had to use winetricks and download the vcrun6 package since the install program requires mfc42.dll. Without it the trial period expires upon the first run.

Here are some details about my setup:

Wine version:               0.9.58
Windows version:            XP
Distro:                     Slackware(-current)
Kernel version:             2.6.24.3-smp
CPU:                        Intel Core 2 Duo E6750
GCC version:                4.2.3
glibc version:              2.7
xorg-server version:        1.4.0.90
Video card driver version: NVidia GeForce 8600GT 169.12
Notable configure opts:     --with-x --enable-opengl

I ran the program with:
$ wine C:\Program Files\Notation\Composer\Composer.exe > backtrace.txt 2>&1

To recreate the problem: get mfc42.dll (with winetricks vcrun6 thx Dan) install the program and start opening menus. The faster they are opened the sooner the program crashes.

Well the first thing you should do is get a newer version of wine  
 
http://www.winehq.com/download/ 
 
I recommend installing from tarball. This isn't to hard to do if you follow the 
instructions in the README file. Also have a look at the wine users guide.

essentially it is not missing 'ipconfig.exe' but it's output i.e. it doesn't use 'ipconfig.exe' to make changes but only to gather information about your machine.

a solution was provided here:

The messed-up palette.

This worked in 1.3.25. WA did not work at all in 1.3.26 producing an error message on startup.

In 1.3.27 Worms Armageddon's frontend flicks between having a messed up palette and having a normal palette on many screens. It's still usable but very uncomfortable. Ingame appears unaffected.

Presumably also affects Worms World Party but that is much harder to get working under wine.



I've fiddled with WA's own palette bug workaround settings (designed for working around palette issues in Windows Vista and later) all to no effect.

All the usual wine workarounds are enabled in WA (most notably the Use desktop window workaround which is required to actually be able to see the frontend).


Configuration of WA has not changed from 1.3.25 when it worked.

it refused to accept my username and password.

+relay+seh+wininet showed that it was crashing in InternetQueryOptionW()

did give the address in the gui and said it was a read from NULL.
Passing that address to winedbg's disasm pointed to str_to_buffer().
The option it was retrieving was INTERNET_OPTION_PROXY_USERNAME 
evidently req->session->appInfo->proxyUsername was null.

"WINE-31460","Listview LVS_EX_GRIDLINES paints thick gridlines in lists with >3855 items","I have an application that displays very long list views. The application uses the LVS_EX_GRIDLINES style to draw gridlines between rows/columns.

There appears to be a bug in Wine: the further down I scroll the thicker the horizontal gridlines get. At some point the gridlines become so thick that they obscure the whole content of the list view (gridlines4.png). However the content is still temporarily visible while Wine is busy redrawing the list view (which takes maybe a hundred milliseconds)

The first thick gridline (2 pixels high) always appears between the 3855th and 3856th items.

Description: at the beginning of the game you encounter some mutants which are spitting green cloud-like acid at you. That cloud of acid is invisible when running the game under Wine.
You can only notice that something hit you by the red blood effect and by the fact that your HP is decreasing.

Steps to reproduce the issue in the demo:
1) Install the demo as usual. Launch it by NeuroHunter.exe
2) Start a new game from the menu. You can skip the conversation with the NPC by pressing . Leave the cave at the intersection turn left and follow the shaft leading to a room occupied by two lizard-like creatures. Engage them...they will answer with heavy spitting.

According to my tests Wine-1.3.22 is the first version which is able to start the game (without crashing) and the problem is already there.

I don't have Windows installed so I can't show you a picture of the correct behaviour. 
In this video @3:15 you can see what that green cloud should look like:

Essentially being:

HeapAlloc( GetProcessHeap() 0 size)

Further decoded:

HeapAlloc( ((NtCurrentTeb()->ProcessEnvironmentBlock)->ProcessHeap) 0 size)

I haven't found information on register X18 being used for TEB hence this is another guess.
There is no initialization of X18 in caller chain and even in the whole app code.
Running the whole .text segment through disas only reads through ADD and LDR instructions can be found.

Patrician3 is working wore now than before applying this change.

1. My current desktop resolution is 1280x1024
2. Patrician3 changes the resolution to 640x480
3. Then plays the initial movie.
4. Then it tries to change to 800x600 but instead of using it for the game the
desktop stucks at 800x600 and actually you realise that the window that is now
focus is just the Desktop and it is stuck except for the toolbar on the top(the
toolbar has nothing to do with the game I mean the toolbar with the menus on
Aplications System places ... and the rest of icons you have configured). The
rest of the screen is black. You can move the mouse pointer on this topbar but
as soon as you move it away the mouse pointer disappear.
5. If you then change the window (ALT + TAB) you focus the correct game
window. It does this changing the resolution to 1280x1024. 
6. Nevertheless the game options window that appear does not fill the whole
screen but just 800x600.

Before applying Alexander's patch of 17 January 2007 point 4 was:
4. The screen resolution changes to 800x600 and the game screen options appears
filling the whole screen (as it now has the correct resolution 800x600)

The game I'm playing is Diablo II LoD Patch 1.11. I have been using all 0.9.x  
versions of Wine and the colors had been fine. With 0.9.17 the background 
colors of texts (like the name of objects you find on the floor) and the 
backgrouund color of objects (like you have in your inventory or chest) are 
drawn in false colors. After a short time into the game the miscolorations 
start to spread to dialog boxes. And after another short time areas of the 
screen (like the big orbs signalling your life and mana points) first go white 
then start flashing. The color flashing effects get so bad that you have to 
quit the game.

I just update to wine 0.9.46 I was using 0.9.39 before. This update is the most recent stable wine in Gentoo x86 (which is the distribution I'm using).

I was using wine to run ADinstrument Chart (this is a link to the software : http://www.adinstruments.com/products/software/corporate/Chart-Software/) without problem. Now since my last update each time I try to open a file the software crash.

I'm using gcc 4.1.2

I started my program from the .drive_c directory with the command wine Program Files\Chart5fr/Chart5.exe and then proceed immediatly to open a file and it crashs. I try using my data files the exemple given with the software and data files from someone else and it crash each time.

I try to erase all the trace/dump/tmp I could find in /tmp and in c:\window\temp

The reason is that the Engine queries the status of the VMs itself in some circumstances. This creates a TCP connection which is never recreated in case it breaks.

The proper fix is to banish all such queries from the Engine: not just to fix this issue but also because some of these operation can be long (a few seconds) and block the main loop of the single-threaded Engine which can in turn cause the website to lag.",880,"1"

Oh joy LSA again ...

There already exist other bugs falling into same problem domain example: bug 16418

If developer resources are short maybe this could be part of some SoC project: making transition from current approach towards LSA rpc interface and lsass (and fleshing out stubs of course).

I fleshed the stub a bit just for proof and it gets the WCF installer further.

critical or blocker might be closer to the mark: it makes wine useless for
producing pdf files because the pdf files contain custom encoded fonts making it
impossible to extract the text.

Try this. Create a document in word. Print it to a file. Convert the ps to pdf
using ps2pdf (I also tried acrobat distiller with the same result). Open the pdf
file in any version of adobe acrobat. Select the text and copy it to the
clipboard (same result whether you use acrobat in windows or linux) and past to
a word processor. Presto: total gibberish.

There is no work-around because current versions of wine do not make it possible
to load a different print driver. The criticallity is severe since you can't
use MS Office under wine to create pdf files with extractable text.",3263,"1"

"WINE-28023","CoreAudio queue memory leak","While working on a patch to fix the Get/ReleaseBuffer ordering see bug #27184 comment #3 I found a bug in memory management in winecoreaudio's mmdevapi.

510      HeapFree(GetProcessHeap() 0 This->public_buffer)
but public_buffer originates from
1625      sc = AudioQueueAllocateBuffer(This->aqueue bytes
1626              
The APIs don't match.  It currently doesn't crash because
public_buffer is NULL upon regular exit.  This matches:
1634     AudioQueueFreeBuffer(This->aqueue This->public_buffer)

That would be easy to fix but it leads to question how AudioClient_Release frees the buffer queue.

502      if(This->aqueue)
503          AudioQueueDispose(This->aqueue 1)

I suppose that Dispose gets rid of all the MacOS-level elements left in the queue but I doubt it can handle the additional AQBuffer that Wine links to every object via the mUserData slot.

1632      buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap() 0 sizeof(AQBuffer))
1640      This->public_buffer->mUserData = buf

Therefore I believe Wine must iterate through the list (aqueue or avail_buffers?) and free remaining objects one by one.

As I'm not familiar with the MacOS API's I'd like somebody knowledgeable (Andrew Ken?) to check this issue and write the patch.

BTW I believe that correct freeing should first return
This->public_buffer into the queue -- where it originated -- like I did in my ordering patch then delete the whole queue.

+     if(This->public_buffer){
+         AQBuffer *buf = This->public_buffer->mUserData

--- snip ---

It seems if WinVerifyTrust fails that way the caller is not supposed to clean up e.g. calling WinVerifyTrust with WTD_STATEACTION_CLOSE -> WINTRUST_DefaultClose.
The web installer never does - hence the handle + additional data is leaked.

This leaked file handle later leads to a sharing violation when urlmon tries to copy the new file from download cache to destination (DownloadBSC_OnStopBinding):

--- snip ---
0031: create_file( access=c0010000 attributes=00000040 sharing=00000007 create=1 options=00001040 attrs=00000000 objattr={rootdir=0000sd={}name=L} filename=/home/focht/.wine/dosdevices/c:/windows/temp/21006.01/1033/VS_PRO/wcu/vc90sp1/vc_red.cab )
0031: create_file() = SHARING_VIOLATION { handle=0000 }
...
--- snip ---

After 3 download + replacement tries it gives up.

Properly internally cleaning up (closing the file handle ...) helps the installer/urlmon to replace the file.

I was trying to use a statistical program called PAST under Wine. It use to 
run OK but recently (with new Wine versions - wine-20030508 rpm version for 
Mandrake 9.1) I get some problems related to variant array allocation.
Following is the feedback from the program owner Oyvind Hammer 
(oyvind.hammer@nhm.uio.no). The Program site is 
http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past

--------  quote ----------
To be precise the problem is as follows. In Delphi I do
a:=VarArrayCreate([1213] varDouble)
This should allocate a variant array of size 2x3. And as
expected when I query the dimensions of the array in
Windows I get
VarArrayHighBound(a 1) = 2
and
VarArrayHighBound(a 2) = 3
However under Wine I get the reverse meaning that
Wine has allocated a 3x2 array:
VarArrayHighBound(a 1) = 3
and
VarArrayHighBound(a 2) = 2
This causes Variant index out of bounds when I refer
to the cell a[13] for example.

Terminal output before reverting the ntdll commit

Hi folks 

The game No Man's Sky (GOG version) has stopped working in Wine 1.9.17. 

After running a regression test I have found that the following commit breaks Wine compatibility for No Man's Sky: 

commit 4af2012729b7ad656fe240838697eeb2ce5c924e
Author: Piotr Caban 
Date:   Wed Aug 17 12:48:24 2016 +0200

    ntdll: Pass updated context inside dispatch.ContextRecord in call_stack_handlers.

Reverting this commit lets No Man's Sky work again. 

Some info: 

I tested this with the original GOG copy of No Man's Sky before it received any updates via GOG.com to ensure that the issue was not due to an update to the game breaking Wine compatibility. 

I came to the conclusion that there was a regression introduced because after updating to a freshly git pulled copy of Wine 1.9.17 the game would no longer start and the attached terminal output is what I would receive after attempting to run the game. Please let me know if you'd like any kind of log from a version of Wine that is not compatible with No Man's Sky or at least let me know which channel you'd like for me to set WINEDEBUG= to so that I can get you the necessary data to fix the seemingly faulty commit.",6,"0"

Since version 0.9.48 with Heredis 9 an error occurs when trying to display html content with the gecko module.
An error window pops up : Access violation at address 7DDXXXXX in module 'mshtml.dll' Read of address 000000XX where X is a random number. The message is sometimes followed by Abnormal program termination killing the program.

"WINE-1115","Pirch98: Rebar_Layout problem","Bug comments restored from Gmane.org: 
 
When you run the program it is NOT usable it is repainting continually the  
screen and no one control works. It works fine with comctl32 native. The  
problem looks like that happen in rebar because it is giving some ERR messages: 
 
err:rebar:REBAR_AdjustBands Phase 1 failed x=561 maxx=0 start=0 end=0 
err:rebar:REBAR_AdjustBands Phase 1 failed x=565 maxx=0 start=0 end=0 
err:rebar:REBAR_AdjustBands Phase 1 failed x=565 maxx=0 start=0 end=0 
 
If you add a return to the start of the function REBAR_Layout the rebar is  
painted incorrectly but the program can be used. 
 
If you don't remove REBAR_Layout and only comment the last line of the 
REBAR_Layout function  
//REBAR_ForceResize (infoPtr) 
 
Then the rebar are painted better (but no correct) and it is usable.

backtrace from SteamInstall.msi

I've been unable to install Steam for some time across multiple versions of Wine dating back maybe six months.  Current version is 1.4.  I run the installer downloaded from the Steam site as follows:

  $ wine msiexec /i SteamInstall.msi

It starts the installer and displays the first dialog with Next and Cancel buttons.  When I click Next it crashes with the attached backtrace.

In trying again to check a few things for this bug report I noticed it says:

3. sh winetricks -q dotnet20
4. download .NET 3.0 Framework installer from: http://download.microsoft.com

5. export _SFX_CAB_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST=1 (workaround see bug 9158)
6. wine ./dotnetfx3setup.exe

It might take a while until all required packages are downloaded using BITS.

Note: If you need to redo steps backup the directory dotnetfx304506.30 from
c:\\windows\\temp to a different location remove ~/.wine copy
dotnetfx304506.30 again to c:\\windows\\temp to prevent BITS from
downloading over and over again.

The corresponding logfile dd_WF_3.0_x86retMSI48DE.txt reveals nothing it's empty.

Using ORCA on WF_3.0_x86.msi shows that MsiNetAssemblySupport >=2.0.50727 condition needs to be satisfied.
The MsiNetAssemblySupport property should be set in set_msi_assembly_prop() but it doesn't seem so.

Looking into C:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.0\\fusion.dll path there is no native fusion.dll.
Hence Wine's builtin fusion.dll is loaded by LoadLibraryExW().
The builtin fusion doesn't contain version resource so it fails.

This is a subtile problem: adding version resource to Wine's fusion might cause problems because every .NET Framework might ship it's own version of fusion which ought to override builtin fusion.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370325.aspx 

Usually:

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\fusion.dll
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\fusion.dll

AFAIK .NET 3.0 and 3.5 don't bring their own fusion version (someone might check a real Windows installation with these Frameworks present).

The problem is how dlls/msi/package.c:get_fusion_filename() works.
At the point where the installation fails the following registry data is present at the location get_fusion_filename() reads:

I don't know how Windows msi does MsiNetAssemblySupport.
Maybe a check for real existence of (native) fusion.dll to prevent false load of builtin fusion is better.
If native fusion is not present in full path that .NET Framework subkey data (version) can't be used for MsiNetAssemblySupport property.

Commit http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commit/bfd4836867d6d90eaeae6ccbc02e37678b59b8f1 caused an regression which causes the game to crash when trying to switch to OpenGL renderer mode. The problem still exists in wine-1.7.41-66-g4fbaab2 and is thus not identical to bug 38264.

To reproduce the problem:

1) Install the runescape.msi file
2) Start JagexLauncher.exe runescape
3) The game will install updates and then ask to automatically detect graphic settings. Click the button to proceed.
4) At the login form click on the gear symbol at the top right of the screen. Select custom configuration and then click on OpenGL.

WARNING: The game is affected by a couple additional bugs. If the game for example crashes when trying to detect the graphic settings or doesn't accept any input then just restart it until it works which should usually be the case after a couple of attempts. ) Actually those issues are most likely also regressions but I didn't have time to track them down yet.

splinter cell demo #2: shadow error in projector mode

Hi there

I'm currently trying to get Splinter Cell running on my system. After experiencing some massive problems with the full version I switched down to the demo versions (there are two AFAIK) and I'm now trying to get the demo #2 to perform correctly.

I've disabled GLSL and set the OffscreenRenderingMode to fbo.
I also tweaked the Splinter Cell ini a bit so it uses shadow projector mode instead of shadow buffers by changing the line
ForceShadowMode=0
in the D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice section.

Still I get some visual errors with the shadows. Seems like some sort of polygon/decal offset problem see the screenshots for more details.

Also I have the already mentioned light source bug which makes some lightsources shine through massive geometry I'm also attaching these screens.

The console is still flooded with various error messages about invalid GL instructions and so on also going to attach some logs.

The shifted screen bug (that I reported in this bug: http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9609 - screenshots already there) also happens with the demo. If I'm running the demo with 640x480 resolution it doesn't appear though.

"WINE-1406","16-BIT VB 3.0 APP -- NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR ENVIROMENT","Bug comments restored from Gmane.org:

I have been hoping to see this working with baseline WINE releases for about 2
years now. It's not a high priority but it's a curious problem. One particular
application I have errors out with a NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR ENVIRONMENT message
on startup. I do not have the source code for this application.

The application itself is a 16-bit VB 3.0 application used to access an online
database. The header indicates it's an MZ type executable and the imports show
it's based on VBRUN300. There's an NE marker in the header as well. Another
application with exactly the same header (but a different app nonetheless) works
just fine.

The WINE trace shows the following as the cause:

err:local:LOCAL_GetBlock not enough space in local heap 0dc7 for 140 bytes


Now all that said if I uncomment the FIXMEs int memory/local.c and prevent the
call from returning 0 in LOCAL_GetBlock it works fine (for a while at least).
So I guess the question is why are the FIXME's in that function still FIXME's
after all this time. I'm sure there is a reason for not uncommenting this code
but if anybody could shed light on this or get the FIXME's accepted it would be
really appreciated.

I did some more digging it appears that the local heap is hitting the 64K
barrier on an attempt to grow it. The application actually fails in GrowHeap
around line 500 where the check to see if oldheap > 0xfff0 eval to true and a
FALSE gets returned. The error just bubbles up from the call to GrowHeap in
GetBlock. All the heap pointers and size values seem normal so it's really
running out of space. Fair enough so the question becomes WHY is the heap NOT
being exceeded in native Win98 but IS being exceeded in WINE. It only makes
sense that some cleanup of the heap happens under native Win that is not
happening under WINE. I'm a little at a loss from that point though. I assume a
heap walker like program would be helpful.

Probably we put things on the local heap that don't belong there.
Try to find out what items there take up the most space.


------- Additional Comments From marc_lavergne  yahoo.com  2003-04-23 07:26

Makes sense. Can you recommend a program that will let me see calls to the local
heap under Win9x and I will try to track  it down. The error occurs early during
startup so accounting for the allocations by hand is a possibility. I'll compare
it to the calls I see under WINE and post back.

On another note there's a an application that starts with the problem VB
program auto-magically under Win98 WSASRV.EXE (Windows Sockets Asynchronous
Request Server). It appears it is being launched by one of the VBXs. This
program does not start with the working VB 3.0 16-bit prog. 

Also I took a look at the heap using HEAPWALK.EXE but it didn't show anything
of value besides a rough count of 1.8M for the total heap size when running
under Win98.

Since there's a workaround moving this to a normal severity. I haven't had a
chance to revisit it but I will get the heap alloc trace done shortly.
Workaround: modify LOCAL_GetBlock in memory/local.c to prevent arena==0 exits.
Not a permanent fix since it introduces an unhandled condition and is the wrong
way to do things anyhow.",782,"0"

"WINE-959","ChooseFontA dialog never displays the script selection","Bug comments restored from Gmane.org: 
 
The ChooseFont dialog when not using Unicode has an option to select which 
script will be used when the font supports more than one. This option is not 
implemented in WINE at the moment. 
 
In principle it shouldn't be too dificult to implement. All that needs to be 
done is adding a combo box to the dialog layout and filling it out with the 
result of GetFontUnicodeRanges. There is only really need to check for those 
ranges that correspond to the defined charsets (SYMBOL_CHARSET 
SHIFTJIS_CHARSET etc.). 
 
There is however some need to tweak the resources. For each of these charset 
you probably need: 
1. The demo text to use (locale independant). 
2. The display name to use (i.e. - SHIFTJIS_CHARSET is Japanese if the current 
locale is English RUSSIAN_CHARSET is Russian if the current locale is 
English etc.). 
 
It is my experience that under Windows 2000 ChooseFontW puts this combo box 
in but disables it (ugly).

Test program to show differences between drawing 1 bpp icons in DrawIcon() and DrawIconEx()

The function DrawIconEx() doesn't handle Icons with 1 bpp correctly. 

I've attached a test program that will draw many different icons in a line with DrawIcon() and the same line of icons below with DrawIconEx() and DI_DEFAULTSIZE DI_NORMAL DI_COMPAT flags set - which should normally result in the exact same output.

The drawn icons are (fltr):

1 bpp 2x2 chessboard field
32 bpp white black red green blue icons without alpha channel
32 bpp white black red green blue icons with increasing values of alpha


This works fine in WindowsXP with 32-bit color depth (I'll attach a screenshot later).
In Wine the 1 bpp icon is distorted/squeezed the 32-bit icons are however drawn correct.

I'll search where the handling of 1 bpp icons differs in those two functions and fix DrawIconEx() accordingly.

When this is fixed the DrawIcon-Function could just call DrawIconEx with DI_DEFAULTSIZE DI_NORMAL DI_COMPAT flags (as suggested in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648065(VS.85).aspx and done by the test application) and therefore a lot of complicated duplicated code could be removed from dlls/user32/cursoricon.c.",269,"0"

"WINE-28562","Plastic Animation Paper 4.0 doesn't start","Created attachment 36686
plain terminal output

Users reported in the WineHQ forum that the application refuses to start in a recent Wine.
http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=12970

Indeed Plastic Animation Paper 4.0 is showing an error message when launching with 1.3.29:
'Fatal error
Unable to set up graphics mode graphics card must be capable of running 800x600'.

Actually this is a regression which happened between 1.3.27 and 1.3.28.
The problem with bisecting is that that the application is broken between these 2 commits:
http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commit/76fecde8fb2d335e4855bec6d36ffe16cbed04f3
and
http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commit/8e79a7e6644fd6f1e0cfeb8b826e683d171d723a

That was bug #28259 affecting several apps/games.

If I apply the patch (in commit [76fecde8fb2d335e4855bec6d36ffe16cbed04f3]) on [8e79a7e6644fd6f1e0cfeb8b826e683d171d723a] then I receive the same error message that the application produces in current git.

So I think the offending commit preventing PAP 4.0 from starting should be

Not sure if this is related but suddenly the splash screens in all my apps are

The default wineprefix created by running wineboot (or anything else) on a 64 bit system is 64 bit even if wine64 is not explicitly used. However wine-mono is not automatically installed to a 64 bit wineprefix unless wine64 is explicitly invoked. There is no warning to the user that wine-mono is not being installed and http://wiki.winehq.org/Mono says nothing about needing to specify wine64 to install/uninstall it in a 64 bit wineprefix.

If not installing wine-mono to a default wineprefix unless wine64 is specified is the intended behavior there should be a warning about that in the console at wineprefix creation and it should be documented on the Mono wiki page.",1559,"1"

"WINE-11281","CJK input: cannot type in legacy applications","Created attachment 10369
An approximation of Japanese legacy application

There are so many issues I don't know where to start.

The good thing is the input sort of works so there must be something present in Wine that handles it one way or another. However it is unusable in its current state.

First a CJK font is needed which is not normally present in Wine. Also Wine cannot pull characters that do not exist in current font from other fonts so all relevant system fonts have to be mapped to something that actually contains the characters.

For Japanese the font Kochi Gothic is quite useful but it does not contain much in the latin range.

Now in the Wine notepad the Japanese characters are displayed only if you go to the font selection select a font with Japanese characters and select the Japanese script. I don't know why is that some Latin accented characters are displayed even if Japanese script is selected but not the other way around.

Now typing Kana (and even Kanji) works with scim in notepad except the cursor is always positioned in front of the part just inserted (is not moved after inserting characters). Doing some cursor movement appears t orestore the cursor to the right position.

However typical win32 application is codepage based and would only work with SJIS encoding. After generating a SJIS Japanese locale and executing the included test application with
LANG=ja_JP ./testwin.exe
I get the text displayed correctly. Unfortunately now the input does not work because scim runs in UTF-8 and wine in SJIS. This is the same as any other X applications run in that locale. However starting a whole X session in an obscure Japanese locale is not a solution (although it seems the application would work).",494,"0"

sblive emu10k1 midi

Midi ports are identified by the applications (MPU401 uart) however midi data 
does not transfer correctly if at all.  Sending a 16K sysex from a midi 
device to midiox.exe (see url above) results in roughly 1K received at which 
point wine (midi.c) hangs in a critical section.

Oher midi apps yield similar results.  Alsa seems to be working as I can 
capture sysex streams with cat /dev/midi > dump.syx just fine and send them 
back to the device with cat dump.syx > /dev/midi - all good.


thanks!

"WINE-42074","osu! - Audio latency regression (ALSA)","Introduced in wine 1.9.10 still present in 2.0-rc3. Copying my description from a comment on another issue.

Hello I'd like to describe my experience with the added sound latency. I'm the author of https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40716

I'm using ALSA (no PulseAudio) with patched winealsa.drv for reduced latency. The patch is simply changing three constants at the top of mmdevdrv.c (DefaultPeriod MinimumPeriod EXTRA_SAFE_RT) to lower values (the ones that work for me: 22000 22000 11000 respectively).

On wine 1.9.9 and earlier where everything works fine this results in an extremely low (almost none) audio latency which is good. Reducing DefaultPeriod and MinimumPeriod lower makes the sound crackle a lot. Reducing EXTRA_SAFE_RT doesn't seem to change anything.

On wine 1.9.10 and above the minimal values of the constants seem to be around 10000 and 10000 for me below that there's no sound at all (there's no crackling stage). The audio latency is much higher (both on good values from wine 1.9.9 and on the new minimal values) which makes the game feel much worse.

"WINE-26876","special file CON not handled correctly","Created attachment 34269
test binary

In some applications it is desirable to temporarily redirect stdout/stderr to a file and then switch back to the console output. This can be accomplished using the special file CON as stated at
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/58667/en-us
Wine seems not to handle this as windows does:

To reproduce please compile the following C source or run the attached binary:
#include 
#include 
int main() {
        errno=0
        fopen(CON w )
        printf(errno: %u\n errno) errno=0

        freopen(CON w stdout )
        printf(errno: %u\n errno) errno=0

        freopen(CON w stderr )
        printf(errno: %u\n errno)
}

On native Windows this outputs 'errno: 0' into the terminal three times.

On wine it outputs 'errno: 13' (=EACCESS permission denied) after the first fopen. The further two output lines get lost. They're not written to named file CON either.

I set the severity to normal since I don't know another way of accessing the console attached to the program if stdout/stderr were redirected. Also this might affect any SDL program as re-redirection to the console is recommended there (http://sdl.beuc.net/sdl.wiki/FAQ_Console). (Running SDL apps through wine is convenient during development)

Note:
For SDL programs however the redirection of stdout and stderr to files can be disabled in the first place by setting the environment variable 'SDL_STDIO_REDIRECT' to '0'.",20,"0"

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=commith=6d6e9a42b13c827d1cc795c3b66da8c032374fff
http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=commith=b2ad268a8b7d7ac65029bbdd71d14f2c0f1b260d

I won't question if there was a specific need to introduce this ...

Reason of crash in FlsAlloc() is simple.
Different TEB definition in  vs.  leads to incorrect TEB allocation size (ntdll -> thread.h) vs. usage (fiber/Fls -> winternl.h)

Solution: use winternl.h TEB definition to ensure correct TEB allocation size in dlls/ntdll/thread.c
Either change include order of both (needs ) .. or sync both .. or better get rid of the thread.h one to avoid such recurring problem.

The trace
http://bugs.winehq.org/attachment.cgi?id=20398
shows that DeleteSecurityContext gets called twice with the
same handle. The trace does not contain the crash stackstrace as Warcraft 3
catch the exception and writes down it's own stacktrace file.

The trace has been made with a wine build based on commit 1f00a870ec6ee of my
repository:
http://repo.or.cz/w/wine/warcraft3.git?a=logh=1f00a870ec6ee172afa7ffc82a1692317c090a3a

So the bug is either that it should be possible to delete a security context twice or the bug causes the DeleteSecurityContext method to be called twice.",273,"0"

Max Payne 2 uses a lot of full-screen single-colour blending effects that
usually fade in and/or out. In Wine these effects are rendered as full opacity
making it impossible to see if you're getting shot.

During Part 3 Prologue there is a point where the screen is blended with a dark
red at low opactiy. This effect does not go away until you get to a certain
point (where it MAY change to a differend blend). It is impossible to see where
you are going and thus the game is rendered unplayable. Fortunately you can
still escape to the menu.

This error can be reproduced either by starting the game without cdrom (in which case it starts in network-mode) or by starti
nt the game normally and then trying to launch a new network game.
Unfortunately there are no demo or free versions of this game to include here (Software 2000 doesn't exist anymore but distributing abandonware is probably not legal in all countries).

This error might be related to Bug 4066 but the dplay error is different in this case.

err:d3d:check_fbo_compat >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> GL_INVALID_VALUE (0x501) from Framebuffer format check @ utils.c / 968
fixme:d3d:check_fbo_compat Format WINED3DFMT_R32_FLOAT with rendertarget flag is not supported as FBO color attachment and no fallback specified.

Full output is attached.

According to a mesa developer the problem is that current mesa git master implements ARB_texture_rg and wine thinks it also support R16G16_FLOAT textures:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30823

Indeed when disabling such mesa extension with the env variable:
MESA_EXTENSION_OVERRIDE=-GL_ARB_texture_rg

the warnings no longer appear (output also attached).

Other than the warning I see no obvious visual differences. I am using wine 1.2.1 found on Ubuntu 10.10 with a Radeon X1600 (RV530) card using the gallium r300 driver.",91,"0"

traffic for these applications aren't working anymore: with µtorrent
(http://www.utorrent.com/) the dht (the protocol using udp) doesnt work
anymore the number of nodes connected reported starts decreasing until it
reaches zero and never increases again.
With emule (http://www.emule-project.net/) and kademlia it's the same problem
kademlia (protocol using udp) gets disconnected after a while and emule is
unable to reconnect to the network (stay in trying mode).
the output of netstat for that udp port is the folowing:

udp port is a reachable from internet)  the number of nodes (shown at the
bottom should start increasing wait  some times until it reaches zero dht
doesnt work anymore (you can test it by adding a torrent and modify the tracker
to something bogus to force the use of dht but the torrent won't start
downloading)

for emule : download it install it make sure udp port is reachable from
internet if it's the first time you might need to connect to a regular server
first then start downloading something then go to the kademlia page and click
connect. now wait a certain amount of time (no downloads are required during
this)  until kad get disconnected (the top right arrow goes from green to red

Currently bug #36375 prevents this bug from testing unless you revert the offending commit from #36375.

The game fails to start an error message is shown: 'Fatal Error: Failed to create material 'er_icon05'.

The result of the regression test:

Reverting this commit as well as the one from #36375 lets the game start.

You need to rename/remove intro.avi from the installed game when testing because it causes an early crash.
Let me know if you need debug logs or further tests.

An NZB file to import into Alt.binz which references Usenet articles that are known to trigger the memory leak

Both Wine v1.1.8 and v1.1.9 rapidly leak memory whilst using Alt.binz to download certain Usenet articles  whereas v1.1.7 remains fine.

Using Wine 1.1.7 after 30 minutes downloading:
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
steve    18012 15.5  1.5 3722036 32804 ?       Sl   15:08   5:10 altbinz.exe

Using Wine 1.1.8 after 15 minutes downloading:
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
steve     1277 28.0 25.6 3723204 528200 ?      Rl   14:33   3:17 altbinz.exe
Nearly half a GiB has leaked already.  This seems to be proportional to the size of articles downloaded/decoded so far in this session.

Eventually Alt.binz will start to display various out-of-memory dialogues and cease responding.

Whether or not memory is leaked seems to be related to some property of the articles being downloaded  I believe it's only Yenc encoded articles that are affected.  To aid with reproducing this problem I've attached an .NZB file which will queue articles known to trigger the problem immediately in v1.1.8 but not at all in v1.1.7.",184,"0"

found this while investigating some issues with Aeria Game Launcher (https://www.aeriagames.com/playnow/ignite).

Aeria requires .NET Framework 3.5 installed.
After applying 'wintricks -q dotnet35' recipe to a fresh 32-bit WINEPREFIX the 'Aeria Ignite' installer silently fails.

The reason is that some folders such as '%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data' are completely missing and the installer fails to put some files below that.

Those folders are created during WINEPREFIX creation (wineboot).
Deletion afterwards won't let them get recreated (prefix update).

Further investigation reveals this happens during .NET Framework service pack recipe runs where products to be upgraded are uninstalled (expected by design).

Some folders are essential for many installers/apps.
Deletion will cause subtle problems on further software installations (the actual apps) or at run time.

Especially true for:

'%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data'
'%USERPROFILE%\\Local Settings\\Application Data'

Those are precious and need to be preserved.
On Windows this scenario never happens because there always exist dozen of subfolders below by default.

A quick fix would be the creation of (empty) subfolder below for example 'Microsoft' which is present on all Windows systems by default.
This prevents the deletion of the parent.

Another option is to fix bugs like bug 34910 which needs '%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes\\' folder present which would automatically thwart the folder deletion attempt.

 If you think it is nescessary to show others your complete config for a

 MS-DOS drives configuration

 Each section has the following format:

 Filesystem=xxx (supported types are 'msdos'/'dos'/'fat' 'win95'/'vfat'
'unix')
   This is the FS Wine is supposed to emulate on a certain
   directory structure.
   Recommended:
   - win95 for ext2fs VFAT and FAT32
   - msdos for FAT16 (ugly upgrading to VFAT driver strongly recommended)
   DON'T use unix unless you intend to port programs using Winelib !

Open or create a project with 1 or more files.

Now collapse the project treeview in the Project tab right-click the project
and go to Project Options click Ok to close the dialog that comes up and
the files in the project appear one additional time in the treeview. So the
first time you do this you could have

Project
|-A
|-B

The second time you do this you'd have:

Project
|-A
|-B
|-A
|-B

The effects are cumulative the third time:

Project
|-A
|-B
|-A
|-B
|-A
|-B

If you open the Project Options with the treeview expanded instead of
collapsed the items appear normally.

code in project.pas (since the other places where the code is called from can
also be made to manifest the bug):

A recent change in CVS caused Xnews () to crash on

I've traced it to the patch

nothing about this how this part of the code works. 
 
The crash happens on the following code in PE_InitTls loader/pe_image.c: 
  if ( wm->tlsindex == -1 ) { 
    LPDWORD xaddr 
    wm->tlsindex = TlsAlloc() 
    xaddr = _fixup_address(&(peh->OptionalHeader)delta

wm is the module Xnews.exe itself.  xaddr and wm are both reasonable addresses but 
the  
problem is that *xaddr was previously marked read-only using VIRTUAL_SetProt in  
map_image memory/virtual.c.  If I change it so that 
VPROT_WRITE|VPROT_WRITECOPY  
is always included again it fixes this crash but then the app dies soon after:

    wined3d: Test and fix ddraw and d3d9 GetDC differences.
   
    The MSDN is not totally correct: A8R8G8B8 and A1R5G5B5 also allow GetDC. The
    main differences that have to be filtered out in d3d9.dll are GetDC on
    A8B8G8R8 X8B8G8R8 and P8.

Running the ddraw dsurface test seems to indicate that ddraw wants opengl enabled in the registry as the DirectDrawRenderer.  Then when enabling opengl a full-screen Seven Kingdoms draws the screen partially offscreen incorrectly.  When virtual desktop is enabled the game is visible correctly.

Also note Seven Kingdoms uses an 8-bit color depth.

It is expected that GDI mode should not produce a black screen.

Bug 20327 is similar but I question whether it is the same problem as it is a D3D game.",6,"0"

Steps to reproduce:
For white text in top lef corner:
1. start playing the game (SINGLEPLAYER > QUICKSTART)
2. click the mouse button twice to actually start playing the game
3. hit F5 to quicksave the game
4. set a name of the game and click on Save
5. OK all the dialogs
6. F5 again
5. the white text appears in top left corner game slows down until text disappears
(This may not work in the demo.)

For writing a cheat:
1. start playing the game (SINGLEPLAYER > QUICKSTART)
2. click the mouse button twice to actually start playing the game
3. hit Enter and write something
4. game slows down
5. hit Enter again
6. game is OK again

It is not playable during the time game is slowed down. Also I know two things:
1. Neither CPU or Memory usage goes up during the slow down.
2. There are no errors or text in the terminal during the slow down.

Test project (VS2005) of a simple RPC client/server to repro the problem

Rpc clients that specify variables or the return value as a comm_status or fault_status variable normally do not guard their RPC call with a SEH try-except clause. After all using comm_status or fault_status variables is usually done because with these variables  SEH try-except can be omitted as any exception from the client side or server side part of the call is transformed into an error value that is assigned to the comm or fault status variable. However the current implementation of NdrClientCall2 unconditionally raises exceptions which an RPC client using comm_status and fault_status variables is not prepared or expected to handle. As a result such RPC clients crash immediately if any error occurs during the course of an RPC call. Find attached a VS2005 project of a simple RPC client and server that can call a variety of RPCs with different comm and fault status behaviour on client and server side that can be used to reproduce the problem.
