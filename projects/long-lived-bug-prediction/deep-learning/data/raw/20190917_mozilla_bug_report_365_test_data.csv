I spent several hours today and yesterday trying to fix orange (which we ended up just commenting out the tests) for something that would have easily been found with strict warnings enabled.  It's really easy to fix and could be a big help for people debugging their tests.",3,"0"

"CORE-180861","Form Submission should not know about PresContext","PresContext is 100% about content.  If there is something in PresContext that it
needs either that resource is in the wrong place or there is a substitute in

Three things I see in nsFormSubmission that use it:
- GetBidi() (Simon can you shed light here?  Is there a method in content
somewhere we can use?)
- GetLinkClickHandler is in PresContext but it's really nsWebShell so we can
get the DocShell and QI to nsILinkHandler.  Even *better* might be to put the
method on DocShell and call it something else since we're not really clicking a
link )
- GetEncoding() doesn't appear to need it anymore even though we pass it in. 
Yay :)

The nsHTMLFormElement methods just need it to call into nsFormSubmission.",1086,"1"

"SEAMONKEY-146411","3rd party LDAP Query may result in an invalid filter.","The Mozilla Address Book does not allow a blank search condition when attempting

StartSearch() method. But 3rd party products like OpenOffice.org integrate with
Mozilla using the DoQuery() method. Attempts to run a query using the
DoQuery()against a Mozilla LDAP  Directory requesting all the Mozilla attributes
will result in an invalid filter i.e. (|) getting generated. 

Investigating this behaviour further it is not sufficient to simply generate a
blank filter as this will default to the filter (objectclass=*) thereby
returning all entries from the LDAP Server regardless. Thus I have suggested
that we default the filter in this case to (mail=*) to return entries which are

The function goToLine of the viewSource.js can not go to the last
line.

I was trying to use this function for writting a new browser extension.
But I am not able to jump to the last line of a file:

The reason is because of this code:

         if (curLine == line && !(range in result)) {
 -  489           result.range = document.createRange()
 -  490           result.range.setStart(textNode curPos)

    492           //
    493           // This will always be overridden later except when we look for
    494           // the very last line in the file (this is the only line that does
    495           // not end with \n).
    496           //
 -  497           result.range.setEndAfter(pre.lastChild)
    498 
 -  499         } else if (curLine == line + 1) {
 -  500           result.range.setEnd(textNode curPos - 1)
 -  501           found = true
 -  502           break
    503         }

Line 499 there is a condition with curLine=line+1
Unhappily if you try to go to the last line there is no line +1 and it does
not work.

A few months ago the Netlock Class QA root certificate was submitted to add it to the certificate repository.

But there was some change in hungarian regulations and we should switch because these to the other root CA certificate profile (there was some predefined root CA certificate profile) to follow these regulations.

So the actually used root CA certificate has different extension follwing the regulations and we would like to ask you to change it.

(previous request is here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279728 )
(maybe open bugs are closable regarding our previous request because the extensions which cause bugs are not critical now.)
(this problem was reported to the RFC maintainer qcStatement should be not critical)

The new Netlock Class QA certificate is the following.
(Purposes are the same.)

Somehow we're hitting this assertion:

It seems that mHdr is pointing to a valid Header with mCapacity=0 but the address of that header isn't the same as sEmptyHdr like it should be:

Although gdb indicates that it *is* the same address. I think that there are multiple sEmptyHdr symbols getting linked together somehow although adding NS_HIDDEN to its declaration did not resolve the issue.

- move everything into sample.config
- normalize all paths in sample.config to be workable across platforms (ie a path of 'pageloader/chrome' will be correctly interpreted as 'pageloader\chrome' on windows)
- to handle the different counter options under different platforms created win_counters and unix_counters which are correctly used depending on the system
- add a --debug option and get that out of the config file

So as long as things are installed in the 'standard' locations you should be able to run talos across win/mac/linux using the same sample.config.

The login page of DR (http://drhome.digitalriver.com/live/login/ec_login.htm)
has a password and username field for login.

Firebird offers to remember this information. My login is 4 characters big with
a password much longer than that

However when I come back Firebird fills in the fields with the right login

I've been working on the changes on various REFLOW_{YYYYMMDD}_BRANCH
branches.

The basic idea to make two closely related changes at the same time:
 1. Change intrinsic width computation so that it happens in separate
    methods on nsIFrame.  (Currently preferred with calculation using
    the nsIFrame API can happen in two different ways as well:  having
    only one codepath reduces incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.)
 2. Change the way we handle incremental layout to use dirty bits on the
    frames rather than the reflow tree (which is essentially out-of-line
    dirty bits) and a complicated system of reflow reasons that often
    leads to weird incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.

I hope to add more details of the new design here in the near future.
Much of it is still open to change at this point the branch is close to
compiling and probably a ways from working so the cost of changing

"FIREFOX-420556","sidebarheader on GNOME has a transparent background","Created attachment 306847
patch v1: fixes problem

The sidebar header on GNOME has a transparent background because its -moz-appearance: toolbox rule overrides its background-color: -moz-Dialog rule which causes problems for theming engines like Personas that expect the header to have an explicit background color as it does on Mac and Windows.

The -moz-appearance rule also overrides rules specifying top and bottom borders and it's unclear why there are these contradictory rules but the rules are the same as in winstripe where -moz-appearance does not override the other rules so perhaps they were simply copied from Windows to Linux verbatim.

In that case the intent would have been for the header to have the specified background color -moz-Dialog which we can do by simply removing the -moz-appearance.  Nevertheless that also causes the explicit border rules to be applied and I looked at three other GNOME apps with sidebars (Totem gThumb and Evolution) and none of them give their sidebar headers borders (although Evolution gives it a different background color).

Plus borders look funky with the native GTK splitter which is borderless.  So I think the header should remain borderless while fixing the background color issue which we can do by removing both the -moz-appearance rule and the top and bottom border rules.

Here's a patch that does that.

Note: there are other things I noticed while investigating this issue like that we use a widget (sidebarheader) with no XBL binding that we put its styles in toolkit/ instead of browser/ on Linux and Windows (it's in browser/ on Mac although there's at least one funky rule there as well) and that we pad the header label by four pixels on the left which causes it to be misaligned with text in the sidebar itself (f.e. the Search label in the Bookmarks sidebar).

But I'll file those as separate bugs.

Sure --- I've promised strict mode and breakpad CFI at the moment but once those are in the clear this would be satisfying to do.  But it's filed as a bug now so anyone with gumption should grab it.

---

The bigger cleanup I kept refraining from doing in the upvar2 work to keep the
patch only insanely big instead of super-insanely big is to get rid of almost
all the parameters to jsparse.cpp functions making most of them methods of
JSCompiler. This should speed up the recursive-descent parser.

Beyond this there are some cleanups to jsscan.h to use C++ canonical style. But
again the JSCompiler wants at least some inline helpers to forward calls on
itself to its tokenStream member to save typing and shorten lines full of
redundancy in jsparse.cpp.

---

To say a bit more all the C static functions that have the JSParser signature:

typedef JSParseNode *
JSParser(JSContext *cx JSTokenStream *ts JSTreeContext *tc)

become JSCompiler methods taking zero args. Any cx uses become free and need to
rename to context -- or better we rename JSCompiler::context -> cx. Similarly
for ts -> &tokenStream mutatis mutandis. The tc param needs to be a top of
tree context stack pointer in JSCompiler but that's easy to do too.

Hope this helps and actually wins. Zero params has to make a difference on
code perf as well as size even if we sometimes load this->cx or whatever. But
a second opinion is welcome.",198,"0"

This is really annoying as it can cause you to overwrite text you've just written (since find-as-you-type selects it) or make the text editing field lose focus (depending on the circumstances).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in at https://mail.google.com/mail/
2. Click Compose Mail.
3. Make sure you are in rich formatting mode (click Rich formatting if necessary).
4. Move focus to the text editing field for the body of the message (the field below the Subject: field).
5. Type the accent mark ´ (option-E on Dutch or U.S. keyboard on other keyboards such as Finnish there is a separate key for this usually somewhere on the right use Keyboard Viewer to figure it out).
6. Type the character a.
Actual Results:  
After step 5 a ´ appears in the status bar but note that there's no message indicating that find-as-you-type has started.
After step 6 the status bar displays the message «Text found: á» and Camino selects the á you have just typed.

Expected Results:  
Find-as-you-type should not have started.",1821,"1"

"CORE-439276","Silent script termination when calling atob() with illegal input in JS component","Calling atob() with an illegal argument from a JavaScript component leads to a weird silent code interruption.
While the same call atob() from a DOM Window throws an exception if the context is a JS component the code exits with *no exception thrown* and *no crash*. It apparently just stop executing making error handling or predictable execution impossible.

Should further analysis show this can happen with other JS APIs JavaScript components should be considered very unreliable all at once.
This may also have security implications.

Notice that this happens on Gecko 1.9 and above only. Firefox 2 behaves as expected throwing an exception no matter if the global object is a DOM Window or not.

Step to reproduce:

1. Install the AdBlock Plus extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
2. Open Tools|Error Console
3. Evaluate the following code line:
try { atob(/) } catch(e) { alert(e) } try { alert(Components.classes[@mozilla.org/adblockplus1] .createInstance().wrappedJSObject.__parent__.eval('atob(/)')) } catch(e) { alert(e) } alert(Done!)

It seems to me the behaviour of the accept cookie dialog has changed with 3.0.5 to be non-modal. Maybe this is related to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405239

Now it sometimes happens (a matter of bad timing) that I click on the webpage which causes the accept cookie dialog being opened behind the ff window. It then looks like the web page isn't loaded because ff waits for confirmation of that dialog.

Is there a way to make that dialog modal so that it is never opened behind the window?

I use ff 3.0.5 on win xp/sp3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Accept cookie to Ask every time
2.Open a few pages that demand setting cookies
3.Click in the main window while the pages are loading
Actual Results:  
The Accept Cookie dialog is opened in the background. If you don't look carefully it looks as if ff would hang and wouldn't load the page.

Expected Results:

Any hCalendar microformat with the location element causes the Add to Google Calendar action to be non-functional (i.e. nothing happens when clicking). Additional details and examples can be found at the URL I submitted with this report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid hCalendar microformat minus the location element

3. Add a simple location e.g. Conference Room to the same sample hCalendar microformat
3. Test again with Events > Add to Google Calendar (will not work)
Actual Results:  
As indicated the hCalendar without the location element will be populated nicely into Google Calendar's Add Event form once a location element is added Events > Add to Google Calendar does not respond for that event.

Expected Results:  
The value of the location element should be added to the Google Calendar query string and populated into the Add Event form accordingly. Again on the URL submitted with this bug I have a sample Google Calendar event URL that has a simple location added in the Query string.

I then used simpler and simpler plans eventually submitting without adding anything (but still opening the edit window) and got the same error.

oddly enough this error does not occur when creating a test plan from scratch even though I see similar behavior with there being a space in the test plan document editing window when I open it (i.e. I can backspace to remove a character).

The damage area setup is wrong... the root of the problem IMO is the 'aRowSpan'

value (2) which is the result of:

see the second example.

Create a bug for the product and component (I had this done in previous version 
2.14 already the problem may apeare here probably)
Edit the bug (add some comments) and submit. Keep the component as is

Ezpected
========
All international characters will appeare correctly
Submit will succeed.

Observed
========
Some international characters were shown incorrectly
Submit failed with message A legal component must be selected

Reason
======
All HTML pages miss encoding information and when browser selects some 
default it is sometime incorrect.

Solution
========
Edit header.html.tmpl and add line into HTML header with encoding (I used

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a testcase.
2. Load another page in the same tab (e.g. your home page).
3. Press Back.

Result: Crash.


Stack from a nightly build:

0    PresShell::Freeze() + 420
1    PresShell::EnumeratePlugins(nsIDOMDocument* nsString const& void (*)(PresShell* nsIContent*)) + 236
2    PresShell::Thaw() + 132

4    nsDocShell::CaptureState() + 668
5    PL_HandleEvent + 36
6    PL_ProcessPendingEvents + 128

Security-sensitive due to suspicious stack -- how does PresShell::Freeze end up on the top of the stack?  PresShell::EnumeratePlugins only appears to call GetElementsByTagName and (through the callback) StartPluginInstance.

In a debug build there are two assertion failures and the stack makes more sense: StartPluginInstance is at the top and the rest is the same.

###!!! ASSERTION: Object nodes must implement nsIObjectLoadingContent: 'objlc' file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp line 6234

Break: at file ../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h line 849


I think the problem is that EnumeratePlugins assumes that anything with the tagname object that QI's to nsIContent is safe to pass to its callback but StartPluginInstance assumes that its argument can QI's to nsIObjectLoadingContent.  Possible fixes:

(A) Make EnumeratePlugins use GetElementsByTagNameNS so it only sees  not all  elements.

(B) Make StartPluginInstance test for nsIObjectLoadingContent instead of asserting and then crashing.",8,"0"

We could quite easily get name clashes with existing attributes depending on

2. Using attributes

Ex. (in XHTML) :  for a 20% with
rule.
Mozilla 0.9.5 Redhat 7 rpm build fails to honor the style whether the margins
are proportional or absolute.
In the proportional case the rule is offset to the right as much as 200% of the
screen width. The rule itself is about a 100% wide. You have to scroll by a
large amount to see it.
In the absolute case Mozilla correctly takes into account the left margin but
fails to honor the right margin. The rule seems to have a 100% width so you have
 to scroll to the right by the width of the left margin to see its end.
This behaviour shows up in xhtml and html (loose DTD). I did not test other

The margins show up as expected under Netscape 4.78 Amaya 5.1 Internet

"THUNDERBIRD-476836","(Activity Manager) %s should be added in plural-form messages","This a bug is related to plural-form messages especially those located in Activity Manager.

In Arabic locale (I don't know if this applies on other locales too) for some numbers (precisely for n = 0 1 or 2) the noun that succeeds the number doesn't need any preceding number because the meaning of the number is within the noun it self i.e. if you're saying 'two-days' (it is one word in Arabic) it makes a bit non-sense to say '2 two-days'. In order to solve that if we have a plural message (let's say '%s days') '%s' is removed for entries where n = 0 1 or 2.

Now the problem is that many plural messages doesn't contain a '%s' within (e.g. 'days=daydays' in mail/chrome/messenger/activity.properties) which means that the '%s' is externally added and the localizer can't remove the '%s' for n=012.

My request is to unify the structure of localized plural messages and make sure that all of them become as 'days=%s day%s days' instead of 'days=daydays'.


Besides some other messages need to have the plural-form too (like 'autoRetry=Trying again in %S seconds' in the same file).


Note: That bug is *not* related to the plural-form rules but to the format of plural messages.

Why is the Options... dialog modal? No changed in the options dialog will result in an immediate change of rendering of tabs or other parts of the window. So I don't understand why it should block the rest of the window. Furthermore if you are new to Firefox and you use a tutorial to change some props you can't switch between the tut and the options dialog (that's not quite comfortable). The only thing you could do is open another window of Firefox and change the options there.
So I think the options shouldn't be modal.

And another problem with child dialogs:
If I open the Add-ons dialog from the options dialog there are all three controls - close full size and minimize - but at least the minimize-control doesn't make any sense. If I minimize the addon dialog I still can't do anything in the options dialog because the addon dialog is modal too. Why? If I open the addon dialog from the menu Tools it isn't modal. But from Options it is. Doesn't make any sense to me...
(All the other dialogs opened from Options that have these three controls aren't modal.)

And last: In the Advanced tab of Options many buttons haven't got the ... at the end even tough they open a new dialog.

since aScheme seems to be an in parameter it should be const. but the scheme

this should not be a runtime check since people who pass NULL to a get

when can this be null? same in destroyExtProtoEvent


Two more issues:
1. the code asserts that it being a channel has
notificationCallbacks set and that it can get an nsIPrompt off
them...  but necko does not require to have an nsIPrompt available on the

2. channels are supposed to try to get interfaces off the

Adding or removing text from entries in Firefox results in one object:children-changed:add event per character changed.  These events should not be generated.

We are getting the appropriate object:text-changed events both for insertion and deletion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch at-poke and turn event logging on.
2. Move to any entry within Firefox (e.g. location search find name in Add Bookmarks dialog a text box on a web page) type some text and use Backspace to remove it.
Actual Results:  
We get an event similar to this one:

children changed event (object:children-changed:add) -1 0 parent:

Lightning does not create a new ics file.  It does not alert the user that creation has failed and the calendar name appears in the list of calendars but no file appears in the file system and events created in the new ics calendar don't appear.

Thunderbird(HEAD/20050724): this bug shows only when I run the program from
it's *installed* location (/usr/local/bin/thunderbird).  When I run it as
obj/dist/bin/thunderbird then the Account Wizard offers all four types of
new accounts -- weird!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Compile and install with 'make -f client.mk install'
2.Run TB from /usr/local/bin/thunderbird
3.Try adding an RSS account from the Account Wizard -- you can't.
4.Run TB from obj/dist/bin/thunderbird -- and it works normally.
Actual Results:  
Account Wizard offers only 'Newsgroups' and 'Email' accounts.  RSS and
Movemail accounts are not mentioned.

Expected Results:  
Account Wizard should offer all types of accounts.

My gut feeling is that the 'make install' target is broken for the Account
Wizard -- but I don't know which Makefiles are involved.",379,"1"

The style switcher I use works in IE and used to work in Mozilla 1.0 I have
tested it in 1.1 and it no longer works (just found out while useing 1.2a).  I
hav tried to figure out what is wrong and have come to the conclusion that it
has to do with mozilla itself.  Feel free to look at the JS code

it does this in IE and Mozilla 1.0 but not in Mozilla 1.1 or 1.2a.  Instead of
changing styles it just does nothing (which

I shouldn't expect to see a long list of specific channels at either http://www.mozilla.org/community/developer-forums.html#chat or https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html but maybe at the Bugzilla Etiquette page you could add a reference to:

To turn on the illegal nsString detection assertion uncomment the following two
lines. touch nsStr.cpp and remake form xpcom . It will only take you 1-4 minutes
to do that.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11 U Linux i686 en-US rv:1.0rc2) Gecko/20020510
BuildID:    2002051009

Searching a website (like google) with the search sidebar yields results.  The
sidebar has a next button that shows the next results.  Say you push it until
the results shown are numbers 61-80.  Now you do another search from the
sidebar and it shows results 1-20.  If you push next it SHOULD show you numbers
21-40 however it shows you numbers 81-100.  The count should be reset with each
new search.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Search using google in the search sidebar for boogers
2.Press next
3.Search using google in the search sidebar for boogers are nice to eat
4.Press next

Actual Results:  The page shown is google results from 41-50

Expected Results:  It should have shown pages 21-50 according to the google.src

Note that there is a bug in the google.src specification as well in that the

deskmod.org is down - or at least has only a very limited service. For the
reasons see http://www.deskmod.com/?show=news&nid=1942.

When a user hits View -> Apply Theme -> Get New Themes s/he is redirected to
http://mozilla.org/themes/download/ where deskmod.org is mentioned first. This
could lead to the wrong assumption that there are no mozilla themes anymore.
The link should be removed as long as deskmod.org is down (which seems to be
several months).

Marking major since this page is loaded from a menu item inside mozilla.

Well getAllLogins() will throw if it triggers a master password prompt and the

RELATED: The separator between the search criteria and the search results below

want one or max two search criteria and the default (and remembered) position
should respect this logic - i.e. the bar should be much higher than it is now.

Build Identifier: 0.8.0.3

Discovered the bug when trying to develop an xform (main form) to edit another xform (instance form).  

I have a repeat element in the main form that lists the existing model elements and controls in the instance form.  I have created an instance of xform model and control elements to use as templates (controls instance).  Using the xforms insert element with the origin attribute bound to a node in the controls instance I should be able to insert a new xforms model or control element. 

Problem 1: With an xforms:instance element in the controls instance the main form will not load.  The xforms extension appears to be trying to load the xform:instance element even though it is only supposed to be an xml template.  It also tries to load the xforms:instance elements in the instance form.

Problem 2: Taking out the xforms:instance elements in both the form and the controls instances or associating them with a different namespace the form will load. Clicking on the trigger to execute the insert action to insert a control (e.g. input) from the controls instance has no effect.  Tested in Orbeon xforms sandbox it does properly insert the control from the controls instance so it appears that the code is correct.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple xform
2. Create another xform that loads the first xform as an instance and has a repeat to list the controls in the instance xform
3. Create a another instance with a few xforms controls to be used as templates.
4. Add a trigger to the main form to insert an xform control from the controls instance into the xform instance (using origin bound to a node in the controls instance)
5. load the form and click on the trigger.  Nothing will happen.

"SOCORRO-526046","SkipList Generate better signatures for crashes related to unhandled Obj-C exceptions","Sam Stuart and I have been talking about the way Socorro/crash-stats is currently lumping together many unrelated crashes related to Obj-C exceptions and how to make the signatures for such crashes useful.

On 10.5/10.6 these exception-related crashes look like:

0 CoreFoundation        ___TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION___  	
1 libobjc.A.dylib       objc_exception_throw 	
2 CoreFoundation        -[NSException raise] 	
3              

Here frame 0 adds no value and should be ignored/skipped.  Frames 1 and 2 tell us the crash comes from an exception and we want to know that (exceptions can be thrown directly from objc_exception_throw and -[NSException raise] so we need to look for and prepend/compound both and can't ignore one).  Then we want Frame 3 which tells us what bit of code is causing the exception.

The desired signature from the above crash would look like

objc_exception_throw | -[NSException raise] | 

with possible variants (depending on how the particular exception flow happened)

objc_exception_throw | 

-[NSException raise] | 

On 10.4 these crashes look like:

0   	
1 Foundation    _NSRaiseError 	
2 Foundation    +[NSException raise:format:] 	
3      

Here Frame 0 is something that's likely to be ignored/skipped already (certain raw addresses) or something that we already make part of a compound signature/prepend (objc_msgSend).  Frame 1 doesn't tell us anything useful and can be skipped.  Frame 2 though tells us we're crashing from an exception (we want to know that) and we want that compounded with/prepended to Frame 3 which tells us what bit of code is causing the exception.

The desired signature from the above crash would look like

objc_msgSend | +[NSException raise:format:] | 

with possible variants (depending on what frame 0 was)

+[NSException raise:format:] | 

 | +[NSException raise:format:] | 

In summary when encountering these frames please

Skip/Ignore:
* ___TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION___
* _NSRaiseError

Prepend/Compound with following frame:
* objc_exception_throw
* -[NSException raise]
* +[NSException raise:format:]

These changes will help create better exception-related signatures so that we can easily see where they're actually coming from and have crashes grouped appropriately.  Thanks!",93,"0"

"CORE_GRAVEYARD-297923","Write GRE-finding code on macosx and make the standalone glue work","There might be an old bug on both or either of these problems but I have a
patch in progress and I'm just going to stick it here and dup old bugs as necessary:

The standalone XPCOM glue does not work on mac because it uses PR_LoadLibrary
which only loads bundles not dylibs. This can be fixed by using NSAddImage. I
have code in my tree which does this currently and it correctly links to XPCOM
but then there are problems after I call NS_InitXPCOM2 with system calls
crashing (CFURLGetFileSystemRepresentation or something similar in the sequence
of calls at
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/xpcom/io/nsDirectoryService.cpp#202).

My GRE-finding strategy on mac is significantly different from unix and is
based on a plan to ship xulrunner/libxul as a framework: the GRE finder will
look in the following locations for compatible GREs:

some override environment variable for testing purposes
/Contents/Frameworks/XUL
(don't version-check this assuming that if it shipped with the app it's the
correct version)
~/Library/Frameworks/XUL/Versions/
/Library/Frameworks/XUL/Versions/

I still need to investigate

a) whether changes to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH are effective dynamically or only when
the app launches
b) the system-call crashes",7,"0"

"OTHER_APPLICATIONS-397246","CVS-based ChatZilla language packs","In bug 394315 I introduced source L10n (i.e. CVS-based L10n) for ChatZilla. Though the approach taken there works it's not the ideal way to deal with this esp. as it results in extensions with the same ID but different content (due to different localizations).

In IRC and newsgroup discussions we seemed to get to an agreement that the best solution for the future is to go with leaving the core ChatZilla bundling en-US and have language packs for other locales which are marked dependent on the main ChatZilla package for those applications that can deal with extension dependency.
We also should get AMO to support such extension language packs and even offer compound ChatZilla+locale packages as so-called Multiple Item Packages for apps based on toolkit 1.8 and higher.

The target is to get a solution with this for SeaMonkey 2.0 locale repackaging and as a second goal also create XPIs that can be used for Add-On installation on all apps that ChatZilla supports. I'll try to work on those goals in this order.

my@email.com
 - Inbox
 - Drafts
 - Templates
 - Sent
 - Trash

This is the cached list from last time but when I click Get Msgs of if Check
for new mail at startup is enabled the list becomes

my@email.com
 - Inbox
 - Trash

right after the check is done. If I reduce and expand the folder view all my
folders are suddenly back.

I'm using Courier-IMAP and have the following settings in Mozilla:

IMAP server directory: INBOX.
Personal namespace:
Public namespace: shared.
Do not allow server to override these namespaces

Here is the IMAP communication. The first time I check for mail (and the folders
disappear) these commands are sent:

When I reduce and expand the folder view these messages are sent:

2 OK LSUB completed.
3 lsub  shared.*
3 OK LSUB completed.
4 list  INBOX
* LIST (\Unmarked \HasChildren) . INBOX
4 OK LIST completed.

As you can see the difference is that when it goes wrong Mozilla sends the command:

lsub  INBOX./*

instead of this command (which is sent the second time)

lsub  INBOX.*

The last is the correct command since that is what I have set Mozilla up to use
(and it works :)

Why does Mozilla insist on placing the / at the end when I check for messages
the first time even though it's not set under preferences?

This was not an issue with Mozilla 1.0 (there you just had to edit prefs.js
manually to get rid of the / at the end) but only with Mozilla 1.1

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a request for enhancement.

When editing mail in Message Composer/Editor (especially when reformatting the quoted text) it is very convenient to have a keyboard hotkeys to delete text word by word (to the left or right from cursor) to delete to the beginning/end of the line and to delete the entire current line.

Unfortunately Thunderbird does not support such a hotkeys. Can I ask you to consider implementing this feature?

"CORE-166147","autoinitialize mRefCnt to 0","I found a neat little trick from Essential COM to auto-set mRefCnt to 0 and
probably make the code a little faster:

struct nsAutoRefCnt {

    operator++() { ++mValue }
    operator--() { --mValue }
    operator=(PRInt32 aValue) { return (mValue = aValue) }
    operator PRInt32() { return mValue }
}


then I change the NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS to declare nsAutoRefCnt instead of nsrefcnt.

This makes sure that both the initialization happens and that it happens in the
constructor chain.. meaning smaller code size maybe even faster :)

- override the override statements for shared libraries
- use $(BIN_SUFFIX) $(LIB_SUFFIX) for makefile targets as is done on Windows.

Build Identifier: Bugzilla 3.2

When exporting a buglist to CSV in Windows 2k3 (ActiveState 5.10 build 1004) I get one extra line break for every loop/check (FOR EACH IF) in template list.csv. So every bug takes 3/4 lines per column exported!

This was not happening when using Bugzilla 3.0 and Active State 5.8.8 build 822. Is this a known issue of TT or other module?

To fix I had to remove all line breaks and make conditions happen on one line:

[% FOREACH bug = bugs %]
[% bug.bug_id %][% FOREACH column = displaycolumns %][% colsepchar %][% IF column == opendate OR column == changeddate %][% rawcolumn = column.replace(date time) %][% bug.$column = date.format(bug.$rawcolumn %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S) %][% ELSIF column == 'bug_status' %][% bug.$column = get_status(bug.$column) %][% ELSIF column == 'resolution' %][%- bug.$column = get_resolution(bug.$column) %][% END %][% bug.$column FILTER csv %][% END %][% END %]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a search
2. Click on CSV to export bug list as CSV
3.
Actual Results:  
For each bug a column is display every 3 lines.

My solution:
 o) Create a temp directory corresponding to each profile directory that can be
    used to store various caches and other volatile data files. 
 o) Only create a lock in the main profile directory.
 o) Make the network cache and XUL fastload service cleanup any files leftover

"NSS-286685","Rename all softoken private functions and types from PK11 to SFTK","cmd/bltest/blapitest.c
lib/pk11wrap/pk11pars.c
lib/softoken/dbinit.c
lib/softoken/dbmshim.c
Presently all the code having anything to do with PKCS11 has function
names and type names that begin with PK11_ or pk11_ whether inside
the PKCS11 softoken module (where all symbols not defined by the PKCS11 
spec should be private) or outside the softken (e.g. in pk11wrap).

This has been a great cause of confusion for developers who haven't
memorized this code.  When one is debugging one cannot tell by looking
at the source files or the names of the functions on the stacks or 
the names of the types whether one is looking at code below the 
PKCS11 line (inside a PKCS11 module) or above that line (outside the
module).

IMO the PK11_ functions should all be used for the pk11wrapper layer
exclusively.  The softoken module should use some (ANY) other prefix.

Therefore I propose to rename all functions in softoken to begin 
with SFTK_ or sftk_ and rename all types and defined symbols 
defined in NSS-private header files in lib/softoken to begin with 
SFTK instead of PK11.

I have already done this work.  I have changed all (or nearly all)
the NSS-private header files in softoken and all (or nearly) the .c 
files in softoken.  I did not change the PUBLIC header files in 
softoken that define the PKCS11 public API.  

The ONLY problems were due to the code in softoken/pk11pars.h (which 
is really a .c file!) which gets compiled and linked into both 
softoken and pk11wrap.  The source uses symbols from both softoken
and from pk11wrap.  Maybe the many functions defined in this file 
should have another prefix that is neither PK11 nor SFTK but rather
SMOD or SECM or SECMOD or secmod.  But what I did was to rename all
these functions from pk11_ to sftk_.  

Only 2 files outside of lib/softoken needed to be changed.  They were:

cmd/bltest/blapitest.c   (which calls softoken's fips selftest function)
lib/pk11wrap/pk11pars.c  (which calls the functions in pk11pars.h 
                          mentioned above.)

The files changed in lib/softoken were:

lib/softoken/softoken.h
lib/softoken/pkcs11i.h
lib/softoken/pk11pars.h

lib/softoken/fipstest.c
lib/softoken/fipstokn.c
lib/softoken/pcertdb.c
lib/softoken/pk11db.c
lib/softoken/pkcs11.c
lib/softoken/pkcs11c.c
lib/softoken/pkcs11u.c
lib/softoken/tlsprf.c

I will attach a zip file containing the diffs.  The diffs are HUGE which 
is why I'm zipping them up.  They were all made with a global search and
replace script (gsr) except for some of the ones in these files:

cmd/bltest/blapitest.c   changed one func from pk11_ to sftk_
lib/pk11wrap/pk11pars.c  changed numerous pk11pars.h funcs from pk11_ to sftk_
lib/softoken/pk11pars.h  after gsr had to change some symbols back to PK11_
lib/softoken/pk11db.c    ditto 

So I suggest the reviewers should focus on those 4 files and maybe the
header files.  If the headers are right and those 4 are right the rest
should also be right because of the use of the gsr tool.",239,"0"

"CORE-497495","Always poison deallocated objects in the frame arena","Created attachment 382630
spreadsheet summarizing crashes

It's been theorized that we can reduce the security risk due to frame tree maintenance bugs by unconditionally -- even in release builds -- overwriting deallocated frame objects with a poison pattern that forms a pointer to inaccessible memory.  I've done some preliminary testing of this concept and it looks promising: of six crash-on-load test cases that I have five change from jump to an address that might be controllable by an attacker to data read from the poisoned address and the other one appears to not involve frame objects directly.

Attached will be:

1. A spreadsheet listing the small handful of current sg:crit bugs that contained test cases that actually crash a release-mode build of current trunk (where current means right before the focus patches landed -- specifically revision 1057ca8f2a91).  Each is annotated with the crash syndrome in unmodified trunk and with the patches that I'm proposing.

2. A tarball of all the test cases I'm using.

3. A tarball of the automation I'm using.

2. Two patches which together implement the poisoning.  They are feature complete with one critical exception: both Windows and Linux define certain regions of the address space to be permanently inaccessible but MacOS X does not.  On MacOS we need to instead mmap() a couple pages of memory mprotect() them PROT_NONE and use an address in the middle of that range (to catch both positive and negative offsets).  I would prefer if someone who actually has a Mac wrote the code for that.  (It would also be good if someone else carefully checked whether my understanding of the address space layout on Windows and Linux is accurate.  I'm cc:ing bsmedberg largely for that reason.)

5. A third patch which is *not* intended for inclusion but which you will need in order to reproduce my results.  It does two things: dissociates this experimental build from normal profiles and adds a special mode to nsSigHandlers.cpp in which we spawn a gdb process to generate stack traces for us rather than trying to do it ourselves this is available even in non-debug builds.  The automation is set up to use this special mode.

note the const!... My guess is that the idl stuff is not converting
'in boolean' to 'const PRBool'

Here is my suggested fix (put in a [const] before the in boolean permanent
NOTE: I have had to do this before and found the syntax by looking in
dist/idl for [const]

which had a very interesting comment that some X servers will add extra font
names to a reply to XListFonts (-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*)  rather than to
XlistFonts (-*). This is true for Linux and XFree86.

On my machine  xlsfonts -fn '-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' returns 2623 lines
but xlsfonts -fn '-*' return 1777. Most if not all of the extra lines seem to
be partially qualified forms of scalable fonts i.e. it's replacing some of the
'0's. More important the second form is significantly faster.

If alt text is added to an image via JavaScript this alt text is not picked up by screen readers eventhough it is present in the DOM.

Please see the attached test files.

00 is the case that is broken.

01 is the same as 00 except the alt text and tabindex are already set. The JavaScript code sets them again but this time the screen reader will see the alt text as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a screen reader such as JAWS running. 
2.Open the 00 test file.

For qute and gnomestripe we use a generic straight-on closed envelope rather than the perspective very older-Qute-styled opened envelope that they use for new-mail-alert.png and for pinstripe we use the Reload button from Firefox 1.5 which is a particularly horrible choice.

We should either redo all three new-mail-alert.pngs so that they are strongly and recognizably in the style of the current themes and use them for all three preview.pngs or decide that they were a bad choice switch to something like the Write icon and switch the preview.pngs.

For the preview.pngs we need to do three things:

* ensure that they are of the current theme not a past version (qute) or another theme (gnomestripe since it's just a copy of qute's)

* ensure that they don't display icons that we plan on removing from the toolbar

* ensure that they don't trip over bug 509242 by making them all less than 220px wide: currently the pinstripe image is particularly badly horizontally compressed",56,"0"

"WWW.MOZILLA.ORG-433993","___() function on mozilla.com has broken fallback to en-US","the ___($str) function was taken from mozilla-europe.org code and its purpose is to return a localized string for the english string we provide or fall back to English if the string does not exist. It is mainly used in places like headers footers and the download box like that:

echo ___('product')

This fallback mechanism does not work on mozilla.com because templates use the HereDoc syntax and we can only include variables in it not function calls so what is done currently is that we just don't have a fallback to English and directly call the variable in the array:


$footer 	= <<<FOOTER

RFC2683 recommands that clients never send commands lines longer than 1000
bytes and servers never accept commands longer than 8000 bytes. Mozilla however
sends even longer STORE commands sometimes.

I believe it happens at least when trying to expunge a lot of mails. Mozilla
first marks all of them as deleted I guess? And sounds like it doesn't optimize
the messageset too well either.

Anyway you should make sure it splits the operations into 1000 bytes or less.
Most servers do limit the maximum line length and Mozilla breaks with them with
large mailboxes.

I'm adding cases to a Run by calling TestRun.add_cases with an array of 100 case_ids and one run_id (with java and apache xmlrpc 3).  

    public STAFResult AddCasesToRun (int run_id Vector case_ids)

oddly I find the index columns set with the first case having index 1 but the next 22 cases having index 2.  the next three cases are 4 5 and 6 respectively but then a spate of 23 7's.  this pattern of mostly repeated indexes continues and in fact seems pretty consistent insofar as I got a similar pattern (a single 1 a bunch of 2's 4 5 6 bunch of 7's) the second time I tried this.

1) The loop which iterates over dependencies (see lines 91-102 in the sample URL) could be broken into two passes. The first pass only checks the %alldeps cache for each dependency and saves each dep that isn't in the cache. The second pass only runs if necessary and actually stats the deps that were skipped during the first pass.

2) The cache-checking code doesn't distinguish between deps that haven't been stat'ed and aren't in the cache and deps that don't exist and are in the cache with a time of undef. As a result a dep that doesn't exist is rechecked for each target that depends on it.

3) %alldeps is initialize incorrectly. The {} on line 54 is a hash reference so %alldeps ends up with a bogus target named HASH(0xsomething). This causes an extra pass through the target loop. Line 54 should probably just be my %alldeps

In my simple tests these changes reduce the number of stat calls by roughly 25%. Most of the benefit is from #1. If nobody else jumps on this I'll submit a patch this weekend.",440,"1"

When opening a bookmark folder in tabs unused blank tabs are not removed as
intended when tabs are loaded in the background
(browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground = true). For example if three blank
tabs are opened by selecting New Tab from the File menu three times and a
folder of two bookmarks is opened the third unused tab should be removed
regardless of the value of the loadBookmarksInBackground.

I believe the problem is due to a misplaced line in
bookmarks.js::openGroupBookmark():

653       // focus the first tab if prefs say to
654       if (!loadInBackground || doReplace) {
655         // Select the first tab in the group.
656         var tabs = browser.mTabContainer.childNodes
657         browser.selectedTab = tabs[index0]
658       }
659 
660       // Close any remaining open tabs that are left over.
661       // (Always skipped when we append tabs)
662       for (var i = tabCount-1 i >= index --i)
663         browser.removeTab(tabs[i])
664 

The variable tabs should be declared outside the if (!loadInBackground ||
doReplace) statement so that it can still be used in the subsequent call to
browser.removeTab() when loading tabs in background and doReplace is false.

I've been trying to think of some options. For instance if document.popupNode was set to the button while the popup is being opened then we could use document.getBindingParent to find the notification and notifcationbox. Another possibility is to specify the popup as a XUL element which in our case would be part of our notificationbox xbl. Another idea I had was to clone the popup and append it as a child of the button and use type=menu. I mention this because the popup doesn't behave like a normal menubutton although it resembles one.

"MAILNEWS_CORE-237095","Wrong token counts when re-training against msgs already marked as junk / not junk","While doing some tests on the new junk mail controls I discovered a problem
with our token accounting which comes up when a user blows away training.dat and
re-trains against good/bad messages that have already been classified. 

Steps:
1) Remove your training.dat and decide you want to retrain. This will become
very common with the new junk controls which perform best if you retrain.

2) Try to retrain your filters against ham and spam that have already been
classified.

We end up calling nsBayesianFilter::observeMessage
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/extensions/bayesian-spam-filter/src/nsBayesianFilter.cpp#787)
which gets the current classification and the new classification provided by the
user when they choose Mark as Junk / Mark as Not Junk for re-training.

This method examines the current classification and removes the tokens for this
message from the appropriate training set. We then add the tokens for the
message to the appropriate training set based on the new classification. 

Consider the case where the old classification == the new classification in
conjunction with a user who has just removed his training.dat file for
retraining. This user selects a bunch of messages already marked as junk and
marks them as junk again for re-training purposes. The first message has its
tokens added to the junk training set. Lets say it contained a word like
'Viagra'. The next junk message first removes itself from the training set. Lets
say this 2nd message also contains the word Viagra. We have one token for viagra
with a token count of one from our first message. By removing the tokens for the
2nd message we end up removing the Viagra token. Then the 2nd message tokens get
added back in. Leaving us with a Viagra token with a total message occurrence
count of 1. But it should be 2!!

Extrapolate this scenario out over the course of retraining against already
classified messages and we'll end up with counts of 1 for any tokens shared
amongst the messages! Oh no!",63,"0"

"CORE-94768","provide a switch to turn off the building of Acccessibility","This is being driven by two factors:

1) There may be builds that do not want to include the building of
accessibility. For instance in a PDA-type device where there is no MSAA
accessibility and they have severly limited space.

2) The fix for bug 77648 has introduced a dependancy on MS Active Template
Libraries ( for windows builds only ) and some people may not want to install
those pieces of the development toolkit. Not to mention we are trying to keep
the codebase as compiler agnostic as possible ( although ATL seems to be
implemented on more than just the MSVC++ compiler -- Borland ).",7,"0"

fix

I caught this random failure in a debugger with extensive logging enabled. Decoding appears to be stalled with mBufferExhausted set to 1 but we're still in DECODER_STATE_DECODING. Unfortunately gdb is super-lame in my Linux VM and can't give me stacks for non-main threads but it seems to me that the loop while (mDecodedFrames.IsEmpty() && !mIsDecodingCompleted) needs to also check mBufferExhausted otherwise we can get into a situation where mBufferExhausted is 1 the step decode thread is Wait()ing indefinitely under if (mDecodeStateMachine->mBufferExhausted) and the decoder thread is simply looping in its while loop.

Of course I can't verify that my patch fixes the bug but it does seem necessary.

I moved the NotifyAll to after we set mBufferExhausted to true. We don't want the decoder thread to wake up see that mBufferExhausted is false and go to sleep again.

I removed the check for mState == DECODER_STATE_DECODING because nothing could have released the monitor since the last check of mState and this confusingly implies that something could have.",3,"0"

If calling AppendComment with an indefined $timestamp (e.g. AppendComment($bug$login_name$message)) the query is supposed to substitute function NOW() in the INSERT query.

Unfortunately now that the query is done with DBI and placeholders it appears that the function call is being bound as a string causing an incorrect zero timestamp to be stored instead of current time. This zero timestamp apart from being bogus means added comments are not displayed on bug pages.

I am not talking about black text on black background.

Basically some sites have text that Firefox will not render. Also highlighting it shows a strange behavior...the text does not appear rather your highlighting shows up but it is as if you are highlighting just a bunch of spaces.


I've noticed this sometimes before on websites that say like Here is the code and then they post the code and you see where the text should be but it's not there. If you highlight it it gets highlighted but it still doesn't appear.

Recently I've started noticing this a lot more. One of the sites I recently hit that has the problem is http://store.2600.com

I have a web page I'm trying to view which consists of some invalid HTML.  It is basically a series of several hundred tables with each table containing a couple of other tables.  Some of the  tags are not terminated with a .  This means that eventually the DOM reaches 128 nodes deep (rather than 10-12 as was intended by whoever wrote the code to view the page).  It turns out that Firefox is pruning the DOM at a depth of 128.  The page displays fine in Konqueror and IE but is pruned on Firefox.

This is not likely to be the best way to handle this situation even though I realize this was probably intentional to avoid layouts bringing the browser to its knees.

Perhaps the max number of levels should be raised to 1024 or lifted entirely?  Or child nodes added as siblings beyond a certain depth so that at least the info doesn't actually disappear?

I think we need to - at least - update+correct the testcases' explanations so that the tester would know what to expect and a bit of explanation (why) (parent's height is auto) so that he wouldn't file bug. As it stands everything in the testcases test7.html and objtest7.html lead or would lead a tester to report a bug.

Another idea would be to create a wrapping div with a fixed height so that the testcase would evaluate measure and test the rendering of an | when given a relative height. This would be ideal.

Expected results:
-----------------
1- Provide explanation in respective documents (test7.html and objtest7.html) that when an  or  has height=nn% and when its parent's height is not explicitly specifically defined (i.e. it depends on content height) then the parent's height is auto.

Notes like the one that was being shown at 20:06 BRDT (GMT -02:00) Bugzilla
will be down for an upgrade on Friday November 8 from 6:00PM to midnight PST
means almost nothing to me. It only means that sometime in between November 8
and 9 Bugzilla will be down. I don't know what does PST mean and honestly I
don't care nor will you care what does BRDT mean now you have the GMT
offset. So the announcements should look like the following (  means optional):

(1)This bug is being written at 20:46  (GMT - 02:00)
or
(2)This bug is being written at 20:46  (22:00 GMT)

v1

The url-classifier relies on synchronous=OFF to get decent update performance on its large transactions.  This opens up the possibility of db corruption in the case of a badly-timed power failure.  There's no user data lost we just need to rebuild the db from the server.

Right now we only reset the db if the corruption is detected when the database is open which isn't always the case.  Attached patch will recover from corruption detected during the update or lookup process.

Since -moz-cellhighlight is the correct color for selected cells in non focused trees / lists on Linux (and -moz-cellhighlighttext the correct text color) this should be used for those elements and resembling elements in Mozilla too.

For Win32 nothing changes: -moz-cellhighlight* is the same color as -moz-Dialog* but this makes it more distinguishable and it will be easier to implement a new color for this if it is ever needed. What's more is that richlistbox.css from winstripe is still shared with gnomestripe.

For Mac I don't know what to do: currently for trees and lists -moz-mac-secundairyhighlight is used but not for richlistboxes.

BuildID:    2002041711

Below `Agencia' and `Conta' on the left of the web page there's a Java applet
in which you're supposed to enter your password.  No matter what I enter there
after I click on the `entra' button I get back the same web page now with an
error message in red below the applet saying `Atenção: senha: conteúdo nulo'
(meaning Attention: password: null contents).

The same web page works fine on Netscape 4.79-1 on the same machine and OS.  It
fails similarly with Mozilla 0.9.9 included in Red Hat Linux skipjack-beta2
using Sun JRE 1.4.0 as the Java plug-in and with Mozilla 0.9.9 on MS-Windows 2000.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.browse to that web page
2.enter `1-9' for both `Agência' and `Conta' (otherwise the check-digit
verification will fail before the password is tested)
3.enter anything at all as the `Senha de auto-atendimento' in the Java applet
4.click on `entra'

Actual Results:  An error message saying the password as blank is displayed:

Atenção:  
Senha: Conteúdo nulo !

Expected Results:  If an incorrect password with 8 digits or longer is
entered you should get to a web page saying `DADOS NAO CONFEREM'.  If a
non-blank password that is too short is entered you'll remain in the same web
page with a message saying the password must have at least 8 characters:
Atenção:  
  Senha: Conteúdo deve ter no
     mínimo 8 caracteres !
If the correct password were entered you'd gain access to the account but
you're not supposed to get that far :-)

I'm notifying the bank that some people may be trying out odd passwords on that
web page for account 1-9 1-9.  Hopefully this won't be a problem :-)

Build Identifier: Version 1.0+ (20050825) - Mozilla1.8 branch and trunk

The account/folder popuplist in the filter editor dialog is too small. From the
first folders level on the names are croped. If you've to choose a folder in a
deeper level it could become impossible to do so.

This should be be fixed in trunk AND branch Mozilla1.8

3. As action choose to copy or move the messages
4. Open the popuplist to choose an account/folder to move/copy the messages in

Actual Results:

Build Identifier: Thunderbird version 3 alpha 1 (20060811)

The problem here is that Lightning's iMIP support must move information from the mime parser (an nsISimpleMimeConverter) to the messageWindow UI display. We currently use the ObserverService to implement that. However if the user opens multiple iMIP messages then our calendar information can get associated with the incorrect message window or fail to be associated at all. We could better solve this problem if we had some way to coordinate what messageWindow (or what message) will be displaying the contents of the mime code we are currently parsing.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Lightning (0.3 or higher) onto Thunderbird
2. Email yourself two iMIP messages (ones with Calendar events attached in text/caelndar mime format)
3. Open a second three pane thunderbird window
4. Select both messages and note how Lightning's iMIP bar will show for one window not the other vice versa. 
5. Add the events to your calendars and note that sometimes the event added is not the event that was displayed.

Actual Results:  
iMIP Bar not always displayed
Event to be added to calendar is not the event displayed by the HTML Mime rendering in the message.

Expected Results:  
iMIP bar is always displayed
Correct event is always added to the calendar

There have been several ideas on how to fix this.
1. dmose and mscott talked about using the msgHeaderSink::securityInfo attribute. This attribute would be renamed and changed into a HashArray so that any mime handler could use that as a hook to store valid information that other parts of the code could query and use (in much the same way as SMIME uses it).
2. (Perhaps in addition to step 1) We could also extend nsISimpleMimeConverter so that it has access to the Message URL. From the message URL the nsISimpleMimeConverter could work through the interfaces to get the messageWindow and therefore the msgHeaderSink in order to access this new object described in idea 1. This is also very akin to the way SMIME does this please reference: http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mailnews/mime/src/mimecms.cpp#453 to line 492.",21,"0"

We were finally able to isolate the behavior to a few lines of html and javascript (see the welcome.jsp discussed later). The faulty behavior occurs more often when the complexity of the page increases however the welcome.jsp demonstrates the problem quite well if you let it run for a while. After the welcome.jsp is loaded the javascript will load the return_to_welcome.jsp which is identical but it redirects back to welcome.jsp. When the resource loading goes bad it will throw up an alert saying it cannot find the clock widget. The clock widget is a widget provided by dojo. We are using dojo 0.4.

We added logging to the javascript and this is displayed on the page when resource loading goes bad:

You can run the example at:

http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-ex ... elcome.jsp

If you want I can tar up the war file or even the complete tomcat.

The logging clearly shows that the onLoad event is fired *BEFORE* all the javascript has been loaded. The issue is most easily reproducible on windows (we used both win2k and xp in a VM) but we've also seen it on OSX. However for the example code provided we could only make it happen on windows. All runs fine in FF2 or IE6+. We used a clean FF3 with no plugins.

BTW it is key to use a jsp and *not* static HTML or else the browser figures out that it can cache the entire page and the issue will not surface. Sometimes the issue will issue on the first load sometimes it will take a few minutes..

Another maybe related issue is that we sometimes see that CSS is not loaded. I also actually see this quite often when I go to www.cnn.com with ff3.

BTW in FF2 you can actually see the clock widget on the welcome.jsp not so in ff3.

You can actually see from the bad results (the first set) that the dj_load_init() method is triggerd TWICE before the end of the inline script is run. Looking closely you can see that the DomContentLoaded event and the window onload event both fired prematurely.

In addtion the the dj_load_init() method is only registered as a listener for DomContentLoaded -- not the window.onload event.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
We found the smallest amount of html/javascript that still demonstrates the behavior to make it easier to understand the issue. The downside is that it happens less frequently. To reproduce just load up 
http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-examples/ff3/welcome.jsp
and see it alternating between this page and the return_to_welcome.jsp page. 

After a while an alert pops up saying Could not find Clock!!! This is when the onLoad event has fired prematurely.

Actual Results:  
You get the alert and our logging output appears on the screen

The problem seems to be most prevalent on windows. We can send you server side code on request.

This issue is causing major havoc on our site which is heavily web2.0. And when the javascript loading breaks it leaves the site pretty much broken. We see this issue in ff3 only (tested ff2+ IE6/7 Safari).

"RELEASE_ENGINEERING-984923","Improve prioritizeBuilders","Our current prioritizeBuilders functions has been causing us grief in a few ways:

- It tries to assign work to only the most important builders usually only one or two at a time. we've had many cases where these builders can't assign work because their nextSlave functions preclude any of the connected slaves from being used. For example nextAWSSlave functions won't run a build on spot machines if there have been too many retries. In the case we have only spot nodes connected and the most important builder has too many retries we end up in a case where no work is being assigned. prioritizeBuilders is returning only the most important builder and its nextSlave returns None and nothing gets done. This can cause massive delays for *other* builders that are also pending.

- Because pending jobs start piling up behind these stuck important builders that can't assign work aws_watch_pending tries to start more and more machines to service those requests. Eventually we end up starting ALL the machines including on-demand nodes. In the case described above this unplugs the stuck builder and then all the other pending requests can be serviced as well. I'd guess this makes this function one of our most expensive functions in the code base :)

We should change this function to take into account the number of connected slaves and give other builders and chance to run as well.

Some irc logs for more context:
06:39  bhearsum rail: any thoughts on https://github.com/catlee/buildbot-configs/compare/master...branch_priorities ?
06:39  the idea is to be able to process as many builders as we have slaves
06:39  while still preserving branch priorities
06:40  catlee: as opposed to all of the builders which is probably higher than the number of slaves?
06:42  bhearsum: before it would pick just the most important builders
06:42  bhearsum: which could be just 1 or 2 of the set of pending
06:43  bhearsum: the problem we've been seeing is that those 1 or 2 most important builders can't actually run on any of the available slaves
06:43  catlee: ah
06:53  sorry getting distracted
06:54  the problem the old function was trying to avoid was having slaves connect while the master is iterating through the sorted list of builders
06:56  so before we'd return the list of builders in sorted order. If builder 0 had no slaves we'd move onto builder 1. If a slave connected between then builder 1 would get run even though builder 0 is more important
06:56  so then we changed it to return just the most important builders
06:57  but returning just the most important builders fails when those builders can't assign work due to nextSlave restrictions
06:58  so I'm thinking we should be able to safely consider as many builders as we have connected slaves
07:00  seems fine but i feel like it still hasn't clicked in my head yet
07:01  i'll come back to it after this release stuff calms down
07:01  sure
07:23  catlee: i guess my only question is: why not return all of the builders instead of just len(connected slaves)?
07:25  bhearsum: in the case we have no connected slaves buildbot will process builders in order. that processing happens in a bit of an async loop so slaves can connect in between builders being processed. so the most important builder can be skipped because there are no slaves available at the time and then a slave connects and a less important builder gets it
07:27  catlee: how does that work when we're just returning a subset of all of the builders then? i'm not sure if it was clear but i was suggesting returning all of the builders sorted
07:28  bhearsum: right I'm trying to explain why returning all the builders sorted doesn't work
07:29  catlee: but returning a subset of those builders sorted works?
07:29  * bhearsum rereads everything
07:29  t = 0: sort builders into b0 b1 b2 return [b0 b1 b2]. no slaves connected
07:29  t = 1: look at b0. no slaves move on
07:29  t = 2: slave s1 connects
07:29  t = 3: look at b1 give job to s1
07:30  right i understand that bug
07:33  ok
07:33  so that's what happens if you return all the builders sorted
07:34  doesn't that happen if you return [b0 b1] in your scenario too?
07:35  hopefully not
07:35  because I know we have 2 slaves
07:35  so I'll return [b0 b1]
07:35  if we only have 1 slave I'll return [b0]
07:36  anyway that's my idea for improving things
07:36  right now we return just [b0] no matter how many slaves we have
07:36  yeah
07:36  that's clearly silly
07:36  and sometimes b0 can't run
07:36  so what happens if we return [b0 b1] but both slaves that are free are jacuzzi'ed to b2 which also has pending?
07:37  we are taking into account jacuzzis
07:37  I think...
07:37  oh right
07:37  just not in the context of this diff
07:37  right
07:38  we've already filtered our slaves down
07:38  right ok
07:38  so its' cases like nextAWSSlave that forces things to run on spot/not-spot
07:40  one more question: you mentioned above that sometimes builders can't actually run on any of the available slaves. does that mean those builders don't have those slaves in their list or something else?
07:40  something else
07:40  nextSlave prevents it from running on a connected slave
07:40  ah
07:40  e.g. we have only spot connected but the builder has retries so we want to run on ondemand
07:40  so nextSlave returns none
07:41  this is what's causing some of our spikes I think
07:41  b0 is pending so we're spinning up machines for it
07:42  but it can't run on any of the machines
07:42  meanwhile b1 b2 ... are piling up
07:42  so could we still hit this in a case where we return [b0b1] but the slaves get rejected by nextSlave? (but b2 never gets tried because prioritizeBuilders won't return it until b0 or b1 starts)
07:42  but they're not getting a chance to take jobs
07:42  yeah that makes sense
07:42  i think i have a full grasp of the problem now
07:42  yeah we could still hit it
07:43  but presumably we'll cycle fast enough that it'll be much rarer
07:43  hopefully...
07:43  well part of this is a failure to spin up the right instances for jobs
07:44  but this change should give other builders a chance
07:44  more of a chance than they have now anyway
07:44  i suppose there's no way to invalidate and rerun prioritizeBuilders when a slave connects mid-iteration through builders?
07:44  yeah
07:44  it definitely sounds like a big improvement
07:44  not really no
07:45  I was thinking maybe some caching could help
07:45  like if we're looking at the same builders with same set of slaves then do something different
07:45  or perhaps claling nextSlave from here too
07:45  but that sounds expensive
07:45  yeah...
07:45  it's a mismatch between nextSlave prioritizeBuilders and watch_pending
07:46  well i'm fine with landing this. a comment about the situation where you don't start b2 because of nextSlave rejects would be useful though i think
07:48  catlee: thanks for all the hand holding here
07:48  bhearsum: thanks for digging into it
07:49  in the glorious future it seems like it would be nice to have prioritizeBuilders and nextSlave closer together or maybe the same code
07:49  it's good to have more people to blame^W^W understand this

"CORE-268535","crashes where rt->gcFreeList turns into a small int after last-ditch GCs","I created a multithreaded test app in an attempt reproduce atom related crashes
we've been seeing. It didn't expose crashes with the exact same stacks. But it
does show some interesting problems.

I'll attach the source. I don't have a generic Makefile for it. But it is only
one .c file that builds as a standalone executable that uses only spidermonkey
and nspr. It creates one JSRuntime and a bunch of threads that each create a
JSContext and loop through the evaluation of scripts each containing a bunch of
randomly generated identifiers (all within JS requests).

The scripts currently look like...

function FOO {var FOO_1 var FOO_2}
function BAR {var BAR_1 var BAR_2}
FOO()
BAR()

Of course it creates a ton of those lines. And the identifier lengths are also
randomized.

I believe that my test code represents a valid use of the api and that all
scripts are themselves valid.

I've seen this test fail in a few ways:

1) Crash in js_AllocGCThing (jsgc.c:479) where rt->gcFreeList is equal to 1 (but
should be a valid pointer or NULL). This *seems* to happen when one or more
other threads are doing last ditch GCs. I've seen this a number of times.

2) A ReferenceError reported by the error reporter (e.g. ReferenceError: FOO
is not defined). The identifier in question in these cases in shown as text by
the error reporter. It is always actually a valid identifier that is in the
script (the test code guarantees that - and I've  validated the script contents
in some of these cases to be sure). This error indicates that the interpreter
failed to find an atom at runtime that it absolutely should have found. I've
seen this a bunch of times. This *might* indicate a corrupted atom.

3) A crash in QuoteString (jsopcode.c:402) called by
js_AtomToPrintableString in the case where the interpreter is trying to build
the string to report a ReferenceError (as above). This looks like a case where
the atom that the interpreter is trying to lookup is not only not found as a
property but that the atom used for the search actually represents a bogus
JSString while the interpreter is still trying to use it. I've seen this once so
far.

There are a bunch of #defines at the top for thread counts GC frequency
identifier length etc. I've been twiddling this stuff a lot and seeing
different effects. This test is just a quick hack at this point.

I'm hopeful that this will help in figuring out problems we've been seeing. And
that this might be a starting point for a multithreaded smoketest (at least).",82,"0"

Currently we fail while re-enabling the menu items inside some menus after the printing dialog is closed (see bug 425844). This is caused by using the old Carbon dialog. While we have already switched to mostly using Cocoa the printing dialog has to be replaced by the Cocoa one - that is what Josh mentioned in bug 425844 comment 17.

In NSPR 4.6 I added a Linux so that only the

why you get undefined references for those two

"CORE-336559","Investigate a better security model for injecting functions into evalInSandbox","Currently the accepted model for injecting functions into Components.utils.evalInSandbox is to simply stick the functions on the sandbox object itself. So in a JavaScript component one might do:

var box = new Components.utils.Sandbox(someURL)
box.foo = myFoo
box.bar = myBar
Components.utils.evalInSandbox(untrustedScript box)

As we saw in bug 321101 and friends this lends the untrusted script unwarrented access to the calling (chrome) code giving it a handle which it might be able to use to pull itself out of the sandbox and run chrome code. For bug 321101 (or more specifically bug 319263) we decided to plug all known holes that could lead out of the sandbox but that is really a stopgap solution. We should come up with a better way of exposing functions.

bug 321101 comment 20 describes one such solution. It has the advantage that all objects in the sandbox are created in the sandbox so following anybody's __proto__ or __parent__ chain won't get you anywhere. The major hurdle to that solution however is that a chrome function that returns an object (as opposed to a primitive such as a string) re-opens the hole. The patch in that bug attempts to use (basically) |return eval(uneval(rval))|. However this fails pretty quickly for native objects.

I'm filing this bug to find a solution that makes everybody happy (whether we continue with bug 321101's approach or find a better one).",1447,"1"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U PPC Mac OS X Mach-O en-US rv:1.8.1a3) Gecko/20060705 BonEcho/2.0a3

With seven or eight tabs open at the time I was typing up something in a large text box in the first tab. While the browser itself seemed to slow down a bit (perhaps not any more than I would have expected with that number of tabs open) typing into that text box became very very slow. I attributed this to the automatic spell checker. After setting layoutspellcheckDefault to 0 I have not had a similar problem. While it would be nice to not sacrifice typing speed (to the point that I am waiting for what I have just typed to pop up on the screen a significant time later) when spell check is enabled what would be preferable is an option in Preferences to disable spell check without having to use about:config or user.js.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure spell check is on.
2. Load about seven or eight maybe more (but no more than 12 is really needed) tabs with pages in them. I used a couple Lexis-Nexis pages and a few Google searches but any series of pages should work.
3. In one of those tabs preferably the first have a page open with a large text box to type into. Typing into that box should be considerably slower than normal.

Actual Results:  
Typing into the text box was very slow. After closing several tabs it began to speed up a bit. When no other tabs were open I felt it was slower than normal but still not so slow that I had to switch into another program to finish typing (what I ended up having to do by the end of it).

Expected Results:  
The speed with which the typed text appeared on the screen should not have been reduced by the fact that many tabs were open. Alternately the software should have provided a global option within Preferences easily accessible to disable spell check.

"SEAMONKEY-91113","java plugin install broken for Windows ME","I do most of my e-commerce buying with IE on Windows ME.  I decided to try and
purchase a weedwacker repair part today using Mozilla 0.9.2 on Windows ME.

I browsed www3.sears.com (their parts direct web page) and entered 358799260 as
the model number of the weed wacker.  An intermediate web page was presented
that showed this was a Craftsman Weedwacker and gave me the opportunity to
confirm by clicking Continue which I did.  On the next web page I clicked the
radio button that allowed me to view a diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft
and cutter head.

A popup window was displayed with the message:  Click here to get plugin 

So I clicked as directed to start installing the Java 2 plugin for Windows.

The installation ran to completion.  Afterward I once again tried to view the
diagram of the weedwacker's drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  I exited Mozilla and restarted the
browser at which point I received an audible bell and an error message about
needing to restart to allow something to complete installation.  So I rebooted
my computer and restarted Mozilla--no error now.  I revisited www3.sears.com and
tried once more to view the drive shaft and cutter head.  I was once again
prompted to click here to get plugin.  Well obviously the install didn't work.

I viewed the installed Mozilla Plugins (Help -> About Plugins) and noticed that
Mozilla did _not_ list a Java plugin.

However if I open the Windows ME control panel and invoke the Add/Remove
Programs applet I see Java 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition v1.3.0._01
listed as an installed app.

nsXFormsNodeState can have a method for converting its own constants to NS_EVENTs constants (if ... then ...) to fix the bug. But I don't like a much the approach.

The problem as I can see is nsXFormsNodeState dublicates some nsIEventStateManager constants nsXFormsUtils events constants. Probably is it a better way to remove dublicate constants?

"CORE-505959","ExtractCurrentFrame should not create an imgContainer","Now that bug 753 has landed we have an imgIContainer method ExtractCurrentFrame which creates a new imgIContainer with 1 internal frame sourced from the currently active frame within the original container and cropped to the desired size. This is currently only used by borderImage which more or less just extracts part of the frame calculates some rectangles and coordinates and draws it.

In my decode-on-draw work (bug 435296) I do quite a bit of re-architecting in imgContainer. The design philosophy is that imgContainer should map an encoded image (like a jpeg or png) to decoded frames storing the source data from decode-on-draw or discard-redecode if necessary. This works great most of the time but the one case where it doesn't is ExtractCurrentFrame because there's no source data and no mimetype. The patch currently kludges things to pass in an empty mimetype and do some special handling but this ideally should go away.

Thus I propose that we make a different class called something like imgFrameContainer (anyone have a better name?) which of course also implements imgIContainer and has slimmed down internals for more or less just wrapping a single frame. This separates the two uses and doesn't publicly expose any 'frame-ish' datatype which joe would be against.

I'll probably start work on this soon after bug 435296 lands.

Hi guys

Not sure if it's because of JavaScript or something else but the map does
properly show up on Internet Explorer so I would assume that it should show up
with mozilla right?

It looks like there is much javascript and it could also be that the server
detects a non IE browser and doesn't send the same data. I didn't check that
since I don't have the tools to do it.

The page is in French so if you have some French people working on your team
you may want to ask them to check this out (comments will be in French too in

If a folder of bookmarks is copied and pasted somewhere else in all the

 * Project: Webform (third-party module)
 * Versions: 5.x 6.x
 * Date: 2009-June-03
 * Security risk: Moderately critical
 * Exploitable from: Remote
 * Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------

The Webform module provides a node type which is typically used to enable
site visitors to fill in questionnaires contact or request/registration
forms surveys polls or other forms on a Drupal site. When displaying the
results of Webform submissions the module does not properly filter user
entered data leading to a cross-site scripting [1] (XSS) vulnerability on
sites with a specific configuration of input formats that would normally be
safe. Such an attack carried out against a sufficiently privileged user may
lead a malicious user to gain administrator access to the site.
-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED ---------------------------------------------------

 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-2.7
 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.7

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Webform
module there is nothing you need to do.
-------- SOLUTION ------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 5.x upgrade to Webform 5.x-2.7 [2].
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 6.x upgrade to Webform 6.x-2.7 [3].
This affects SFx and QMO


See also the Webform project page [4].

Fewer expensive QI calls in critical places. More direct typing increases code clarity.

In no situation I have tried (many) does the DOMSubtreeModified event fire.

According to page 27 of the DOM2 Events Module:

This is a general event for notification of all changes to the document. It 
can be used instead of the more specific events listed below. 
[ ...  ...]
The target of this event is the lowest common parent of the changes which have 
taken place. This event is dispatched after any other events caused by the 
mutation have fired.

For me this means that EVERY modification of the subtree including node 
replacement removing/adding nodes changing attributes ... should fire it. As 
said in the spec it also should be fired together with one of the 
events listed below:
 - DOMNodeInserted
 - DOMNodeRemoved
 - DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument
 - DOMNodeInsertedInDocument
 - DOMAttrModified
 - DOMCharacterDataModified

"OTHER_APPLICATIONS-315913","Replace RDF userlist with direct nsITreeView implementation","This is mainly a personal rant because I've only just written the patch so I haven't had time to profile it properly but I get the feeling that Chatzilla spends too much time sorting the nick list. This is particularly evident when an op pings out what tends to happen is that you get join auto-op part and nick changes in quick succession which seems to kill my CPU.

The main thrust of my proposal is changing the tree from a content view to a builder view achieved by setting flags=dont-build-content on the tree. This already allows us to automatically sort when switching channel or when new nicks join a channel. The sort order is initialized once and then the tree maintains its sort although this can of course be toggled. Nick (and op changes in sort by op mode) are handled by removing and reinserting the nick.

Calls to updateUserList are therefore removed in setCurrentObject my_cjoin my_cmode and my_cnick although in the latter two cases calls to _removeUserFromGraph and _addUserToGraph are used to maintain the nick list.

I changed setListMode to clear the tree cache directly it appeared to be relying on some unknown side effect for its attribute change to take effect.

The only other change necessary in the current code was the code that extracts the nick from a given tree row as the builder view does not permit arbitrary attributes I had to extract the unicode name from the RDF data source.

This is a rather annoying title because it means that I can not merely drag the link to my toolbar and go. As it is I need to edit the bookmark to have a title of something that is easy to remember. This is a rather low priority thing but would be great if this was in 2.22...

In the testcase the allocated cell widths are as follows:

Table 2: 75% 25%

now provides API to set boundary address for stack consummation see bug 192414.

By default the checks are turned off and it is responsibility of jseng user to
call JS_SetThreadStackLimit with the correct information see bug 220408 .

Now the problem is how to get this maximum allowed stack address as it seems it
is not very well documented subject on any platform. If NSPR would provide such
API it would be great but past experience tells that it would not happen soon
(the original bug was reported more then a year). 

On other hand if the minimal stack address is known with precision of 10K or so
then adding 100K to it would provide a reasonable guess that would work out of
the box in the vast majority of cases. 

Obtaining the imprecise minimal address is also trivial for any NSPR thread as
it will always have some code near beginning of the stack that calls the
supplied thread callback and returning the address of the first declared NSPR
variable should be sufficient to prevent crashing Mozilla with trivial scripts
(like attachment 113927 which I just used to verify that it still crashes
Mozilla 1.6).

"NSS-70992","nss 3.2 will not build on BSD/OS 4.2","Here's a set of patches that allows the NSS 3.2 release to be compiled
on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

Thanks for your attention.

This leads to sessions being created in clusters of buckets often sharing the
same lock (over a group of buckets).  Pallab has found an uneven distribution of
lock contention for the session table locks which he believes is due to this
clustering.

The proposed remedy is to use a multiplier when computing the hash of a session

If https is required on the built-in web server in a Linksys router it is
impossible to configure the router with Camino because Linksys apparently uses
the same certificate for all their routers. Camino gives an error which says: 

You have received an invalid certificate.  Please contact the server
administrator or email correspondent and give them the following information:

Your certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued
by the certificate authority.  Please get a new certificate containing a unique
serial number. 

This seems fine but then the only option is to click the OK button and use a
different browser. Firefox gives a similar warning but allows the user to
override it and accept the invalid certificate either permanently or just for
the current session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure the built-in web server on a Linksys router to require https.
2. Attempt to connect to the router's web server with Camino
3. Silly rabbit there is no step 3.

Camino refuses to allow connections to the router.

If you go to http://aaguide.co.nz/main/index.shtml you see a site icon
(favicon) in the URL bar. But if you reload the page it vanishes. No matter how
many times you reload (or ctrl-reload or cmd-reload) the page it's still gone.
If you clear the cache it comes back. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to http://aaguide.co.nz/main/index.shtml
2.Observe that the black and yellow AA favicon is present in the URL bar
3.Reload the page and observe that the URL bar now displays a generic icon.

Actual Results:  
Site icon (favicon) was missing from the URL bar. It had a generic page icon
instead.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the correct favicon.

This seems to be the same type of problem as bug 109959 however that bug dealt
with a problem in the Seamonkey browser. This bug seems to be specific to
Firebird as the web page in question seems to be handled correctly with the
standard Mozilla browser. For that reason I'm assuming this warrants a separate
bug.

The problem exists in the latest nightly builds of Firebird on both Windows and
OS X.

The problem page uses  to
define the page icon. It doesn't have a corresponding REL=icon line.

If I save the entire page locally and load it from my computer the problem goes
away. I can keep reloading the page and the icon remains in the URL bar. Could
this be because it's not using the cache?

As a side note the icon continues to be shown on the tab and the bookmarks
sidebar. However it refuses to appear in the bookmarks menu of the Windows
browser at any stage (Mac version doesn't show favicons in that menu anyway)
but maybe that's a separate bug (?).",287,"0"

Now this wouldn't be such a big deal if there were ways to debug this.

Right now i get a stupid error.

It would be nice to see the real or resource path it is actually trying to load.
I have sliced this six ways till sunday and nothing I do is working!
It looks correct in my all-skins.rdf. I even jared up the skin directory in the
hopes i can get it to work.
No go.

We need more DEBUG printfs here.

resource:/chrome/theme_builder/theme_builder/content/
*** Chrome Registration of skin: Checking for contents.rdf at

Is not good enough.

How about some real paths here so i can debug this.

Also is there a way to print out the chrome registry from js or something? (Like
a for in loop)
As to the mappings of where it thinks everything actually is located?

Stuff like this would be timelessly useful.

If anyone has gotten a skin to register and work for an external package w/out
using the existing skins please let me know how you did this.

I am filing a bug on this.

"CORE-498079","Firefox has huge problems to show the Default Browser dialog on the screen","This happens intermittently. But when it happens it happens consistent for a longer time.

When I start Firefox with a new profile I see for the first 8 seconds only the outline of the window then for another 4 seconds the window goes black. Then it finally draws the Default Browser dialog and the problem is over. A split second after drawing the dialog the rest of Firefox appears.

Firefox has obviously big problems to draw the Default Browser dialog on the screen. Or it needs to do a lot of other things first before it is possible to show the dialog.
 
When I confirm the dialog and restart Firefox opens within a second. So it is all about this dialog.

A search for a regression range shows me Bug 463209 as the culprit.

Sometimes the problem appears to be over. But then suddenly it starts to happen again. And then the regression range proves to be correct: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=125f4a227cce&tochange=f5fa6e92cd13",23,"0"

It's wonderful that it defaults to today's date. But what about tomorrow?

using the  tag.  The solution is to specify the class in each

More research info it is not the document reference not working the problem 
is the returned popup window reference. Another weird thing is that if you do a 
reload (without closing the popup window) it will work. 

So my doubt is that at the moment window.open() returns it is still in the 
middle of creating the docshell and hense the window reference is not valid.

I am pretty sure we don't have this problem before (but not sure how long ago 
at that time popup window did not render about:blank initially). I used to test 
stuff like 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
and it used to work. It doesn't anymore.



------- Additional Comments From Adam Lock 2001-06-26 14:14 -------

Eddie window methods should work immediately but the window.document
property won't work until the document viewer has been created and associated
with the window. And the document viewer won't be created until the uriloader
tells the docshell's content listener that there is some content to render. This
minor gap between the window opening and the document viewer being present.

Perhaps we could make process atomic for about:blank or wait in window.open
for the first content to arrive before returning? Ideas?



------- Additional Comments From Eddie Xu 2001-06-26 14:58 -------

The two lines 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
is the exact codes I tested and it does not work. 

Unfortunately I can not block inside 
nsIEmbeddingSiteWindow::CreateBrowserWindow and peek for document viewer 
because it will never be created before I return from CreateBrowserWindow.



------- Additional Comments From Rick Potts 2001-06-27 01:07 -------

hey Eddie
I've spent some time tracing through both your cases (popup.document and
popup.resizeTo) and it turns out that they are related :-)

In the popup.document case it is just as Adam described - no document is
available...  Because nothing has loaded yet...

In the popup.resizeTo case things are a bit more funny :-)  It is basically
failing for the same reason - no document.  However in this situation it is
the Security Manager that is causing the failure...  Basically it is trying to
verify that you have the right to call resizeTo(...).  Unfortunately since no
document is available it cannot locate a principal...  This causes it to
silently fail :-(.

The funny part is that there is only a small window of time when you *are*
allowed to call resizeTo...  It will only succeed if it is called after
about:blank has loaded but before http://www.yahoo.com :-)  This is due to
security restrictions...

The bottom line is that when ever you create a new browser window you need to
create a nested message pump and block until the initial document (probably
about:blank) has been loaded into the webBrowser...

You can take a look at how mozilla does it at:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/appshell/src/nsXULWindow.cpp#1291

As you also noticed mfcEmbed does not do the right thing either when creating
new windows (or with modality in general)...

I'll see if we can fix up mfcEbbed to do the right thing as a simpler example :-)

------- Additional Comments From Eddie Xu 2001-06-27 07:45 -------

Thanks Adam. 4517 does fix the painting problem but not the DOM. In your test 
case (the one with setTimeout(splurge() 3000)) if we change window.open
(about:blank) to window.open() like most site does your example won't work 
either. So this is what I am going to try on the embedding side:

After a popup window is created I am going to explicitly load about:blank and 
do a message pump and wait for the first OnStateChange(NETWORK DONE) to come 
in the new window before I return from CreateBrowserWindow. Sounds like a 
right direction to go?

<<Hi Eddie

The loading about:blank thing was a workaround while we sorted painting 
problems in new windows for bugscape 4517. This now appears to be fixed so I 
don't believe you need to do it anymore.

Adam>>

hmm...my initial try failed. Seems like if I do not return from 
CreateBrowserWindow the doc loading on the new window will never get completed.

Here is the codes:
static void _WaitForDocShellReady()

    nsCOMPtr pIWebNav
    if ((pIWebNav = do_QueryInterface(pNewBrowser->m_pIWebBrowser)))
    {
        CWebBrowserContainer* pWebContainer = pNewBrowser-
>m_pWebBrowserContainer
        //Set it to true so that we can capture the document done event
        pWebContainer->m_bLoadingAboutBlank = TRUE
        ::ResetEvent(pWebContainer->m_hDocShellReadyEvent)

        pIWebNav->LoadURI(Labout:blank nsIWebNavigation::LOAD_FLAGS_NONE)
        _WaitForEvent(pWebContainer->m_hDocShellReadyEvent 5000)
    }
    return
}

NS_IMETHODIMP CWebBrowserContainer::OnStateChange(nsIWebProgress* aWebProgress 
nsIRequest *aRequest PRInt32 progressStateFlags nsresult aStatus)

    {

STATE_IS_NETWORK))
        {
            ::SetEvent(m_hDocShellReadyEvent)
            m_bLoadingAboutBlank = FALSE
            return NS_OK
        }
        else
            return NS_OK
    }
    ...
}



------- Additional Comments From Adam Lock 2001-06-27 09:37 -------

Eddie it may be possible to put some code into docshell that ensures that
about: protocols are loaded synchronously. I have made an initial attempt to do
this which does appear to work but it crashes almost immediatly after in the parser.

I'll attach a patch of my change in the hope that someone might be able to shed
light on the reason for the crash. To me it looks like the http channel is
sending data after I have already received the network stop notification via the
docshell's web progress listener.

hey Eddie
I ran into the same problem when I tried to add a sub-message-pump into mfcEmbed :-(

It turns out that before entering the nested event loop a new nsIEventQueue must
also be pushed !!!

I'm attaching a patch to
mozilla/embedding/browser/webBrowser/nsDocShellTreeOwner.cpp which pushes the
new event queue before calling nsIWebBrowserChrome::CreateBrowserWindow(...)

This seems to fix the problem...

I recommend tht Mozilla also implement this as it is near impossible to define bindings that work with many existing cross-referenced instances.  For example a shopping cart that has an instance that represents the catalog and another that represents the order.  What would be ideal is just to have references to the product in the catalog from the order.  Take for example this bind's calculate:
  <xforms:bind nodeset=items/item/description 
     calculate=instance('inst_catalog')/product[@productId =

I understand that the address operator is expecting an lvalue but I can't figure
out why its rejecting the one being passed in.  This seems to be working for the
tier-1 platforms.  It may be an ANSI compliance issue or a quirk in the aCC
compiler I dunno for sure.  Here is an excerpt from the cpp file that sets
overlayFile:

..........
..........
  nsCAutoString overlayFile

  // Retrieve the mInner data source.
  overlayFile = resource:/chrome/
  overlayFile += package
  overlayFile += provider // provider already has a / in the front of it
  overlayFile += /

"CORE-49748","crash because JSLoader holds XPConnect Service too long","XPCOM tells XPConnect to shut down before the JS Loader is shutdown.

XPConnect does not sever the connections between wrappers and the native objects 
wrapped until its dtor. The assumption is that when XPCOM releases xpc dll's 
nsIModule and causes a call to ReleaseXPConnectSingleton then the last 
relference on the xpconnect service will be released. At this point (when xpcom 
has told xpconnect that the system is going down) xpconnect marks all wrapper so 
that no calls will cross the wrappers into the great unknown.

However the JS Loader holds a ref to the xpconnect service and these 
connections do not get severed when they should.

I'll attach a stack tht shows this.

This is reproducable by doing 'touch components/*.js' then running and closing 
mozilla. JSObject Finalize calls that happen when the JS Loader deletes its 
JSContext (causing a GC) go through xpconnect and become Release calls on native 
objects that are not in a godd state anymore after xpcom has otherwise shutdown 
much of the native system.

I've been through the same problem elsewhere... It would be nice if the system 
were robust enough to always do the right thing during shutdown but much of 
mozilla is not. It is better to leak than crash.

I'll attach a proposed fix. 

The fix changes the loader to only get the xpconnect servive when it needs ti 
rather than holding a longterm ref. I also added code to xpconnect to make sure 
that the service is not brought back from the dead after being shutdown - I've 
seen this before. The patch has the InitClassesWithNewWrappedGlobal code too.",3,"0"

When right-clicking a link to a file (such as one of the files on the page I
supplied in the URL field) and choosing Save Link to Disk Firefox does not send
the current page as the referrer as it does when clicking the link normally.
This is a problem on sites such as the one linked to since they perform a check
on the referrer to make sure it is coming from within their own site. In this
case Firefox downloads an HTML error message rather than the real file.

The API change in bug 170722 lets us send a referrer when saving a file and we
should leverage that in Firefox. I have a patch.

"CORE-315728","NAMEPREP / text rendering holes in IDN processing","IDN processing is defined to only use characters in the Unicode 3.2 repertoire. However at least one character U+1160 'HANGUL JUNGSEONG FILLER' first defined in Unicode 4.0 can be shown to pass straight through the IDN name preparation logic as in this example:

   www.python.info 

is translated to:

   www.xn--python-eyy.info

instead of being blocked as an invalid IDN. Although this character has dodgy space-like rendering in the current Mozilla rendering code and is therefore a display-spoofing risk it is neither ignored nor prohibited in the current NAMEPREP rules designed to prevent these problems since the ignore/exclude lists in NAMEPREP do not address characters not in Unicode 3.2.  

Fortunately this particular character is currently caught be the hand-rolled ad-hoc IDN dodgy-display-character blacklist and is displayed as Punycode. However it would be better if the IDN code was strictly RFC-compliant with regard to characters not in Unicode 3.2 and that this name was thus treated as invalid during the IDN processing removing the need to catch it as a special case at display time.

Although this particular case is not a serious security problem _in itself_ it does suggest that the current IDN processing code is still not watertight and therefore that there may be other unknown IDN spoofing or other security problems lurking which are still not addressed by the current code.",3731,"1"

For publishing we create an nsIURI with an url that doesn't have the file

Testcase: key3.db 

[Spinoff from bug 393835 which was getting long and messy.]

Reporter filed a bug regarding a loss of stored passwords after switching from Firefox 2 to a Filefix 3 alpha (trunk). We were able to recreate the problem using the reporter's key3.db (on XP and OS X).

If I enable password manager debugging I see this logged to the console when it's invoked:

PwMgr Storage: Initializing key3.db with default blank password.

This is generated in http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/components/passwordmgr/src/storage-Legacy.js:

 132         // Check to see if the internal PKCS#11 token has been initialized.
 133         // If not set a blank password.
 134         var tokenDB = Cc[@mozilla.org/security/pk11tokendb1]
 135                             .getService(Ci.nsIPK11TokenDB)
 136 
 137         var token = tokenDB.getInternalKeyToken()
 138         if (token.needsUserInit) {
 139             this.log(Initializing key3.db with default blank password.)
 140             token.initPassword()
 141         }

This indicates that |token.needsUserInit| is returning true for some reason. The branch version of this code is identical (although in C++).

[Another issue here is that the .initPassword() call seems to succeed but it shouldn't because there's already a master password set. I'm hoping that's just a side-effect of whatever is broken.]

To reproduce:
1) Create a new profile with Firefox 2 and quit browser.
2) Copy the attacked key3.db / signons2.txt into the new profile.
3) Start Firefox 2 view all passwords. Enter TestPwd01 when prompted for the master password. Note that there is 1 login stored (google.com user = username pass = password).
4) Quit Firefox 2 start Firefox 3.
5) Go to view all passwords... Note that the Use a Master Password checkbox is no longer checked and that no passwords appear to be stored.
6) Enabling the MP as TestPwd01 doesn't help.

I also tried to recreate to problem *without* using the reporter's key3.db by starting with a new FF2 profile doing a variety of things and then updating to Firefox 3... That always worked. I'm not sure what's special about this supplied key3.db but if it works fine in FF2 it ought to work fine in FF3.",3,"0"

I have a custom FF extension I'm working on that has a tab in the FF preferences window. In preferences_overlay.xul I have a tag like:



Then in validateSettings() I check the settings of the text fields to make sure the data entered is valid. If it isn't I'd like to pop up an alert box stating so **and allowing the user to correct the error and try again**. Going from the MDC docs I should be able to just return false from this function. Doing this will cause the prefs not to be saved (good) but will lead to the Preferences window itself still being closed (bad) when it should stay open to allow the user to correct the error and try again.

Returning true from this validateSettings() function works as expected: the Preferences window closes and the prefs are saved.

I'll mark this as normal priority for now because I don't see a workaround to it. Unless there is some other way I could be validating preferences before allowing the prefs window to close...

A lot of people are keeping copies of their sent messages in their inbox folder or any other folder so as to have full conversations / message threads in one folder. Which is also a common practice for some well-known webmail applications. Therefore it would be highly beneficial to be able to search for both sender and recipient simultaneously using quicksearch. Right now believe it or not in the year 2008 there is no option in quicksearch that allows returning complete communication with (i.e. from and to) one person/contact. And since we all love comfort and Subject From has been there for a reason I think Subject From To or CC should be the new option. Which will spare me from changing my quicksearch options each time I am looking for a subject rather than a person's communication and vice versa. I don't mind having To or CC or From in addition but some people might think it makes the list too long.
A more friendly title for the requested new option might be
Subject Sender or Recipient or even just
Subject Person

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Your inbox folder holds copies of sent messages you are searching for all mails to and from a certain person (complete communication with that contact)
2. Look at quick search options to accomplish your search
3.
Actual Results:  
Be shocked that it is not possible to search for full communications (From and to)

Expected Results:  
Find a default quicksearch option in the quicksearch dropdown:
Subject From To or CC
or perhaps friendlier to read:
Subject Sender or Recipient or Subject Person





Thinking about it in terms of the length of the options list would it do much harm to *replace* Subject or From with Subject From To or CC?",328,"0"

This could be realized e.g. in the form of a simple dropdown list below the Find a bug input box. Default choice for the dropdown list would be All products and most popular products like Thunderbird and Firefox should be at the top of the list.

Have a look at the visual product selection when posting a new bug for inspiration. It is interesting to realize that while there is an excellent visual product selection option when *posting a new bug* there is no product selection at all available when *searching for an existing bug* (unless you use advanced search which is way to complex for such an everyday task). 

Imagine you are a newbie or non-freak user of bugzilla.mozilla.org. People have advised you that you can check there if your favourite long-standing bug has been posted already and post a new bug if necessary. Mozilla's people also have a strong interest in that people should search existing bugs before posting new bugs to avoid duplicates. Finding existing bugs before even starting with posting a new bug would help to avoid duplicates from the start.

There already exists bug 408338 about Thunderbird having session restore and bug 449967 about generalizing the toolkit session restore this bug is specifically about implementing tab session restore.

Each tab opened in Thunderbird will be viewing a search result calendar tasks or possibly address book (see bug 457270).   When a user shuts down Thunderbird we need to save the position and state of each of these tabs. 

In Firefox when you run the browser after saving your session it asks you in a dialog before starting if you want to restore the session or start a new one.  In Thunderbird we are going to do this a bit better than that.  On start up Thunderbird should open normally with one extra tab in focus a session restore tab.  

In the session restore tab we can list the various tabs a person had open in a grid layout.  Each item in the grid can be opened individually as well as having an option listed above all tabs to restore the entire session.  This session restore tab can remain around until the user selects ( Restore Entire Session ) or closes the tab manually.

When we restore a tab Thunderbird should attempt to bring it back to the exact state it was previously including focus and scroll positions.  Obviously in mail like the web sometimes what a person was looking at before no longer exists (at least in the same place).

Build Identifier: The bug order (js_FinishRuntimeScriptState --> js_SweepScriptFilenames) can still occur and cause crash

Dear developers:
    I am investigating the bug order (js_FinishRuntimeScriptState --> js_SweepScriptFilenames) in latest javascript code in hg repository. In this bug order js_FinishRuntimeScriptState will destroy a hash table then js_SweepScriptFilenames will access this table causing a crash. I have used sempahores to successfully enforce a feasible schedule in latest source code to prove that this bug order can still happen.
    
    Although this bug can be hidden by another fix for another bug 131246 (the fix for this bug is adding NULL check at js_{MarkSweep}AtomState) this bug order is very dangerous. In the past 7 years (starting from the bug 133773 at 2002) developers have tried some ordering mechanisms like js_WaitForGC to avoid this bug order but failed.

    The corresponding bug order in old code (js-1.5) is (js_FreeAtomState --> js_{MarkSweep}AtomState). Regarding the fixes in bug 133773 my schedule can cause a crash (please refer to the 133773 and 477021 bug pages for more details) because the NULL check at js_{MarkSweep}AtomState has not been deployed when bug 133773 is being fixed. This means that the fix in bug 133773 actually can not fix 133773 and a crash can still occur after the patches in 133773 are added.

    Since I am using semaphores this bug can happen at each execution.

I upgrade from 2.18.4 to Bugzilla 2.20.1 last week and now i have a problem with the new ssl behavior.

We use http/https for connections from intranet and block http via firewall from internet only https is allowed. But we have customers who need to connect with http (didn't accept self signed certificates in proxy configuration) so this customer ip is special configured in the firewall to accept connects with http. 

Until the upgrade all work fine but now i can connect the login page with https and if you submit the login data the submit is send with http that is blocked by the firewall.

I've try parameter sslbase and ssl with several combinations but nothing works. Either it switch at submit from https to http (ssl=never) or i will be redirected to https even if i start the connection with http (ssl=always or auth).

The right behavior for ssl force redirection = never should be that i connect with http and stay at http and if i connect with https i stay at https.

There was a similar bug in 2.16.x if i remember correct.

    virtual ~Sample()

    NS_IMETHOD QueryInterface(const nsIID

}

    *aResult = NULL

    {
        delete this
        return 0
    }

    return mRefCnt

I'm a bit confused about the code in QueryInterface:

    if (aResult != NULL)
    {
        return NS_ERROR_NO_INTERFACE
    }


Shouldn't aResult contain a reference to an interface? Why isn't this
code something like if (aResult == NULL) ??

Why does this function test that aResult is NOT equal to NULL? If the result is
a non-NULL value wouldn't this mean that aResult has accessed an interface?

Somewhat confused.

Incidently the XPCOM reference implementation of QueryInterface at
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/QI.html might be a better way to go in the
tutorial. From what I can see aIID is tested via the equals function and if it
can't be found they place the zero into a temporary nsISupports pointer called
foundInterface if it is found then the address of the interface is placed into
this variable. They then test the ptr with the following:

    nsresult status
    if ( !foundInterface )
      status = NS_NOINTERFACE
    else
      {
        NS_ADDREF(foundInterface)

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

firefox (and other unamed browsers) incorrectly handles punycode encoded domain
names.   This allows attackers (namely phishers) to spoof urls of just about any
domain name including ssl certs. 

Proof of concept url:

http://www.shmoo.com/testing_punycode/

The links are directed at http://www.pypal.com/ which the punycode
handlers render as www.xn--pypal-4ve.com

The domain was just registered so the root servers may not have gotten it yet.
 Point your dns servers at '216.254.21.212' if you have problems. 

Here's what I think the bug is:

1.  firefox (and mozilla) should warn the user if punycode is in use at all
2.  You should consider validating the ssl cert with the non-decoded version of
the website

Just in case it's not clear an attack case could be an ebayer/phisher who
includes links to paypal in their auction. When the auction ends the buyer
clicks on the paypal link (which is a punycode/proxy to the real paypal) and
proceeds to steal all of their private green bits. 

I have not done any platform testing or tested any other versions of
mozilla/firefox/etc.  I assume this bug is cross-platform.

The proof of concept urls are hosted on a personal server and as such I'd like
to have a chance to bring them down before this bug becomes public.  Please

See comments from number 28 in bug 428843. This causes undesired side effects with an inaccurate message.

Following on from the above patch Firefox now prompts to save 'tabs' on exit even when none are open.

Apart from the message being inaccurate because no tabs are open this is an extremely frustrating annoyance.

When no tabs are open there should be no prompt. In the rare event that the user accidentally closes the browser they can always go to the most recent one in their history when they start.

As things now stand the user would either have to
1.) Put up with the prompt each and every time they close the browser.
2.) Disable the prompt and never get prompted even if they have multiple tabs open.
3.) disable the prompt but have the session restored every time thus bypassing their homepage.

I feel the patch for 428843 should therefore be backed out.

1. Ensure preference browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true

Stale is a flag indicating that the previous request from the client was

During frame construction we create pseudo frames when non-table-related
frames are inside a table but not inside a table cell.  Similarly we create
pseudo frames when a cell is not inside a table.

The problem is that if a dynamic modification of some sort happens (changing the
display of the frame that forced the creation of the pseudo frames removing
it from the DOM etc) the pseudo frames do not get destroyed.  They stay in
the frame tree.

Bug 156888 and bug 97506 (last testcase the one in bug 97506 comment 14) have
testcases that demonstrate the problem.

It seems to me that we want to somehow mark a frame that forced pseudo-frames to
be created and have a way of getting from that frame to the outermost
pseudo-frame it forced.  Then ContentRemoved (which both DOM removal and frame
reconstruction go through) should tear down not just the primary frame but also
all the pseudos it forced into being.

We would like to include two new aggregators in our l10n providing a better user-experience since their UI is available in Basque:
- Netvibes[1]
- Alesti[2]

At the moment we have these (in the mentioned order):
1. Bloglines
2. My Yahoo
3. Google Reader

I think this order would be better:
1. Netvibes
2. Alesti
3. Bloglines
4. Google Reader
5. My Yahoo

The first two because they're in Basque and are popularly used. Bloglines is widely used too so I think it's good to have it in third place followed by Google Reader. Yahoo is the less famous one.

Axel has told me we need approval from Alesti --I suppose Netvibes has already given its approval for other cases-- so I've emailed them to info@alesti.org (waiting for an answer).

Minor nitpick. Click assumes the user relies on a mouse to activate links.
Users of accessiblity devices and text-only browsers will often use other
methods of activating links such as a keyboard or voice recognizition.

proposed fix

We can get into situations where we have an offline imap move/copy operation to a folder that doesn't exist. Since we do all move/copy operations pseudo offline this can affect non-offline users as well. E.g. rogue code :-) like the patch in bug 451995 can do this. Whatever the cause the problem is that we will keep retrying the move/copy every time the source folder is selected and it will never succeed. It also prevents us from getting new mail for that folder.

The patch makes us drop the move/copy offline operations if the dest folder doesn't exist. This will make us stop retrying.  Once the offline ops are dropped we will redownload the headers for the affected messages.

This situation should really not happen in normal circumstances so I've made it an assertion.",13,"0"

When using multiple calendars if one of the calendar has a buggy event that has
a  start-date which is after the end-date in the week view the events of the
other calendars after the start-date of the buggy event disappear.

This bug is deprecated since that code is being rewritten in trunk anyway. I
just figured i'd note it here to clarify this to others who might run into this bug.

Appeared after resolution of Bug 307158 and is likely caused by it's fix.

When the window is resized to a smaller size the horizontal scrollbar reapears
as in 307158 but disappears and functions correctly when refreshed. When the
window is maximised the scrollbars disapear but their space remains. After a
refresh the view is corrected.

It apears that the viewport size is not being refreshed correctly on resize but
is on the refresh.

I will add a testcase.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.resize untill vertical scrollbar shows up

"NSPR-66325","PR_LoadLibrary picks up same named file on SHLIB_PATH even if a pathname is specified.","This bug only affects HP-UX.  On HP-UX PR_LoadLibrary calls
shl_load() with the DYNAMIC_PATH flag.  If an application is
linked with the +s linker option the DYNAMIC_PATH flag of
shl_load() causes it to search for the shared library in some
search path such as that specified by the SHLIB_PATH environment
variable.  However the way shl_load(DYNAMIC_PATH) uses the
search path is very aggressive.  For example if you have a
libfoo.sl on your SHLIB_PATH all of the shl_load() calls below
will succeed (assuming none of the specified pathnames refer to
an existing file):
    shl_load(libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)
    shl_load(./libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)
    shl_load(../../lib/libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)

    shl_load(no/such/dir/libfoo.sl DYNAMIC_PATH|BIND_DEFERRED 0)

One would expect that only the first call should succeed i.e.
the dynamic library search path should be used only when a
plain file name containing no directory is specified.  Indeed
this is the behavior of dlopen().

We should modify PR_LoadLibrary() to pass DYNAMIC_PATH
to shl_load() only if the specified name is a plain file name
containing no directory so that PR_LoadLibrary has the same
behavior across all platforms.",0,"0"

The lack of SymbolMT support is a regression.  Mozilla 1.8 handled this
font through font-specific encoding conversions.

Mac has a Unicode Symbol font and so doesn't need any special support.

We shouldn't make any assumptions about the encoding of a font with family
name Symbol on Unix because there exist Adobe Monotype and Apple fonts all

considered to be highly politically incorrect (and even more so everywhere
else). Please please use millimeters instead! I know that Postscript is
horribly rooted on the awful inch (72 pt) internally but please spare the poor
end users from such shameful ignorance about contemporary measurements. Don't
export Americas failure to introduce the metric system into the rest of the
world. (1 pt = 25.4/72 mm)

Also for the paper size in the same menu you write DIN A4 DIN A3 etc.
DIN is just the name of the German standards body which has specified this
format just like almost any other standards organization on this planet. To make
it culturally a bit more neutral please write ISO A4 ISO A3 etc. instead.
The international paper size system has been specified in the international
standard ISO 216 since at least the early 1970s.

Also considering that ISO A4 is worldwide the most widely used laser printer
format (only the US and Canada use a different format awfully even one that
doesn't enjoy a sqrt(2) width/height ratio) it would seem appropriate to list
ISO A4 at the first position of the paper selection menu and make it the default
setting. After all around 94% of the world population use ISO A4 and only
North Americans haven't learned to appreciate it's advantages yet. Don't punish
the rest for this.

average American then you can make the Flintstone alternatives the default

"THUNDERBIRD-471223","Remove vestigal tag-anchor.gif","Created attachment 354525
Fix v.1

Not quite up to my usual CVS archaeology standards but:

At some point in the past in the pre-1.0-era before smileys were part of the theme we decided to fork editor's packaging so we could package up just the smileys instead of all the images in editor/ui/composer/content/icons/. Then after that we realized that although we don't need things like tag-body.gif which Composer shows when you enter the Show icons for all HTML tags mode that we don't have  shows tag-anchor.gif even in the normal view so Insert - Named Anchor would have... probably shown a broken image icon or maybe just nothing so we added mail/components/compose/content/icons/tag-anchor.gif.

Then smileys moved to the theme and (here's where my archaeology breaks down) whatever it was that was letting us find editor/content/ things in messenger.jar rather than comm.jar was removed and we went back to packaging all of editor/ui/composer/content/icons/ (or maybe we never changed anywhere other than on the aviary branch) so now we're just jarring up something which nothing can access since there's no .manifest saying to either look for content editor there or to overlay any editor/content/ URI with anything from there.

(Doing some restriction of what composer bits and bobs we package wouldn't be a bad thing but copying the files is the wrong approach: we should either ifdef editor/ui/jar.mn (particularly reasonable given the way we already do ifdef editor/ui/locales/jar.mn) or do what we do with mailnews/jar.mn ifdeffing the whole thing and jarring what we want with absolute paths from a file in mail/ instead.)",6,"0"

With thousands of such articles (including translations and staging) and two polls for each it's causing HUGE lists of things to be output that must then be parsed and then run through dozens of regexp filters -- not to mention every item is checked for permissions which is dozens of database queries each.  This times out constantly.  

Generally speaking we don't use the polls/article lists in this way (we've never put polls in the sidebar modules or in dynamic content) and if we did we could always just use a text input area rather than a dropdown. This will dramatically speed up pages like tiki_admin_modules etc.

The perf results look OK in SunSpider as well: 1% speedup overall. Most benchmarks are a few percent faster a few are a few percent slower. The worst is math-cordic which is 4.6% slower.

* too many slaves on one master is making Buildbot lose some
* the new vlan is configured in such a way that it's causing this
* the new slaves somehow have a different version of buildbot that's busted in some way

Given that this problem hasn't shown up until the new vlan existed and has only happened on the new slaves it seems likely that it's option #2 or #3. We should do a buildbot version comparison on a few new slaves vs old to look at that possibility and rope in IT to look at the vlan config.",7,"0"
"CALENDAR-454998","[CalDAV] free/busy lookups don't work","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 10.5 en-US rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: 2008091118

As you all know bug 452610 made CalDAV-sched an user settable option disabled by default.  The problem is that means free/busy lookups are now disabled by default.  This results in a loss of critical functionality.

If we  leave the default setting we no longer get free/busy lookups.  This is something that worked in the previous release (0.8)

OTOH we get free/busy lookups if we enable the caldav scheduling option but we lose the ability to send invitations.  This is because the e-mail invitation is no longer generated and the caldav-sched invitation is not functional for our server (Bedework 3.4.1.1).

I consider this to be a regression since a critical feature (free/busy lookups) is no longer available.

The speculative connection happens in the BrowserCLH which is ~1.5secs before we actually try to use the URL. The java prefetch happens a little sooner than the Gecko speculative connection and that might mean we get a little better headstart in powering the radio and DNS.

That said having two pieces of code that do the same type of thing is redundant especially during startup. Given that Gecko can actually re-use the speculative connection we would remove the java prefetch.

If the java prefetch has no measureable advantage we should remove it. We need to do some testing using cold powered down cell radios. Launch fennec with an intent to load a URL externally. Measure how long it takes to get to throbber stop. With and without the prefetch.",217,"0"

The signature is invalid because the quoted printable data will be verified - 
not the 8bit data - 8bit data cannot be signed - only 7bit data can be signed 
and verified.

This BUG has been verified on multiple platforms (WinXP Linux Suse 9.1 MAC 
OSX).

This BUG consists of TWO problems :

1. YOU MUST always reencode the message to 7bit/quoted printable PRIOR signing 
as stated in RFC 2633

3.1.3 Transfer Encoding for Signing Using multipart/signed

   If a multipart/signed entity is EVER to be transmitted over the
   standard Internet SMTP infrastructure or other transport that is
   constrained to 7-bit text it MUST have transfer encoding applied so
   that it is represented as 7-bit text. MIME entities that are 7-bit
   data already need no transfer encoding. Entities such as 8-bit text
   and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base-64
   transfer encoding.

2. For verifying mails have to be ALWAYS encoded back to 7bit/quoted printable 
PRIOR verifying - theoretically - the mail within my sent folder (8bit signed) 
should be INVALID but it is not - because you do not canonicalize the data 
before verifying which is an RFC violation too.


SOLUTION :

IF the mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you sign.
IF a signed mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you 
verify.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Deactivated the setting -> Edit->Preference->Mail & 
Newsgroups->Composition->For Messages that contain 8bit characters use 'quoted 
printable' MIME encoding and sign an email with smime using 8bit characters (i.
e. german umlauts)

Actual Results:  
Invalid signature on recieving clients and (also mozilla or any other for that 
matter)

Expected Results:  
Reencode Message to quoted printable/7bit prior signing",435,"1"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 en-US rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050510 Firefox/1.0+

I have an XHTML page with SVG in it which contains a group of image elements.

Via JavaScript a user action triggers an XmlHttpRequest request to a server 
which returns a new group of image elements to be displayed (they are all 
JPEGs).

The result of the request is an SVG document.  The javascript grabs the new 
group of image elements and replaces the existing images group in the DOM 
using replaceChild.

The new image elements appear in the DOM (using DOM Inspector) and I can right 
click on them and see the JPEG's details - but they won't display.  This is 
irrespective of whether I use suspend/unsuspenRedraw or forceRedraw.

See the additional information for the code and sample SVG.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Javascript - send XmlHttpRequest for new group of SVG image elements
2. Convert result into XML node
3. Replace existing image group with new one

Actual Results:  
New images should be displayed on screen

Expected Results:  
New image did not display but were loaded successfully into the DOM

Removing an autocomplete textbox with an active results popup breaks all autocomplete functionality browser-wide.

This occurs with any autocomplete textbox not just rich-text search history ones. It's possible to reproduce the error without the popup box being open (though still by removing the textbox) but this is the most reliable method.

This has been an issue on the trunk since at least September 2006.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install attached XPI.
2. Load chrome://autocompletebreaker/content/test.xul
3. Click top textbox enter a letter so some autocomplete results show in the popup list press the down arrow to select one of the results (without hitting Enter) and click outside the textbox. The top textbox should disappear due to a removeChild() call in the blur() handler.
4. Click in the second textbox.


Actual Results:  
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... Component does not have requested interface arg 0 [nsIAutoCompleteController.input]  nsresult: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)  location: JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml :: attachController :: line 265  data: no]

Autocomplete is then broken program-wide and the address bar no longer functions.



Expected Results:

The Find bar background color is supposed to be red if the string is not found and white if it is found.  The toolbar also displays a Phrase not found notice if the string is not found.  When switching between tabs pressing the Highlight all button will cause highlighting to be updated but not the background color or Phrase not found notice.  This gives the user false information about whether the search string is found.

Note:  steps to reproduce will work with virtually any Web site not just the examples.
1.Begin finding when you begin typing should not be checked.
2.In a new browser window open http://www.mozilla.org/projects/deerpark/alpha2.html .  In a new tab open http://www.mozilla.org/support/ and switch to that tab.
3.Press F to open the Find box.
4.Search for a string that is on the first tab but not on this tab.  Example: broken (without quote marks).
5. Switch back to the first tab.  Press Highlight all.
6. In the first tab search for a string that is present on this tab but not on the second.  Example:  Reporter tool (without the quotes).
7. Switch to the second tab and press Highlight all.
Actual Results:  
Background is still red after step 5 and white after step 7.  Phrase not found is still displayed after step 5.

Expected Results:  
Red background and Phrase not found should be updated after pressing Highlight all.  Background should be white after step 5 and red after step 7.  Phrase not found should not be displayed after step 5.

    [span]
      [b]

this becomes an issue however when one has something like:

  item1
  item2
  item3

  item5
  item6
  item7

which will give:
[ul]

    [b]
     [b]

one idea I had was to not to insert a [b] when the parent node is already a [b].
But a that will not help in a case like:

  item1
  item2
  item3
  item4
  item5
  item6
  item7

Another idea I had was to use a  element that will have its style set
according to these formatting tags. For example:

  item1
  item2
  item3
  item4
  item5
  item6
  item7

will become:
[ul]
  [li]
    [b]
      item1
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: bold]
      [font size=1]
        item2
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: xx-small]
      [b]
        item3
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: xx-small]
      [font size=2]
        item4
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: x-small]
      [b]
        item5
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: x-small]
      [font size=3]
        item6
  [li]
    [span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: small]
      [b]
        item7
[span style=font-weight: boldfont-size: small]

However it will not work with something like:

  item1
  item2
  item3
  item4
  item5
  item6
  item7


this feature also causes issues like if I do:

  item1
  item2

I get:
[ul]
 [li]
  [b id=b1]
   item1
 [li]
  [b id=b1]
   [b id=b2]
    item2
[b id=b1]
 [b id=b2]

At any rate usage of the formatting tags this way is just plain bad html and
this way of parsing causes the DOM to grow alot larger sometimes causes some
content to be lost in the process and sometimes causes moz to
freeze/slowdown/crash on seemingly simple pages (see bug 84466 for an extreme case).

I would suggest turning this feature off (by closing the formatting tags when
the parent tag is closed) and evangelize anyone who uses the tags this way and
expect it to propagate.",1207,"1"

"SOCORRO-865791","Allow for arbitrary classification of crashes at processing and on-demand","Here's what I think I'd like to do about hang processing it will also help solve a few other problems I've been dealing with. I would like a way to do arbitrary classification of crash reports.

The classifier will be a python function (or class?). The classifier will receive the data from hbase (specifically the processed JSON). The classified will produce:
  classification: string
  associateddata: valuestring [optional]

Because we may revise classifications regularly when we store a classification we should also store the version number of the classifier which produced it.

The classifications should be stored in both hbase and postgres. I'm going to throw out these strawmen and let the experts refine as necessary:

* Add an hbase family classifications: each classification will be stored separately as a little JSON e.g.

classifications:flash-hang-classification '{version: 3 classification: bugNNNNNN associateddata: highcpu}'

* In postgres have a partitioned join table with the data:

CREATE TABLE classifications (
  uuid text NOT NULL
  classification text NOT NULL
  version integer NOT NULL
  associateddata text NULL
)

As for applying classifications I propose the following setup:

* At processing time each classifier decides whether it wants to process a particular report. For example the Flash hang classifier would run only for Firefox plugin hang reports which have all four Flash minidumps in the report.

* The API will expose a way to request classification of other queries of crashes as requested by authenticated users.

* The middleware and the new web-facing API layer will expose classifications.

* Classifiers will be deployed as part of the regular Socorro release cycle. I'm not sure whether we should just check them into the Socorro codebase or whether they should live in some separate config repository (they are going to be very specific to Mozilla's use-cases).",102,"0"

        const uint32_t bitmask = (cap - 1) 

The '& ~0x1' forces the LSB to zero which forces the hash values to be even which means that the odd-numbered slots in the hash table are never used.  This leads to more collisions and premature table resizing.

Looks like if I have an input inside a repeat with a nodeset the size of two (so the user sees two inputs)and I tab around the tab goes from the first input to the second very smoothly.  However if I change the value of the first input and hit tab it DOESN'T go to the second input.  It ends up somewhere else (seems like the document).  I see that the repeat's refresh method is called which will delete all of the contents of the repeat element and rebuild them.  I think that is what is screwing up the focus chain.

I receive a could not create proxy folder error when attempting to import

to be the inability to create the temporary folders required during import for 
these folders due to restrictions on the Windows operating system for folder

Expected Results:  Import should have succeeded.

Since Mozilla stores folders as files files cannot contain symbols restricted

though it may affect folders that use irregular symbols.

A workaround is to rename the folders to remove these characters before

"CORE-461031","Investigate mobile responsiveness problems caused by not returning to the event loop","Vlad wrote an instrumentation patch to see why Fennec running on VMs has serious responsiveness issues while loading heavy pages such as CNN.com. Part of his patch works by basically doing setTimout(0) and watching to see how long it takes before the setTimeouts fire. On a VM he saw a lot of setTimeouts firing at regular intervals followed by a massive slowdown (on the order of one second).

In a test run he saw the following event being handled:

{BM(44)BM(10)ES(94)BM(103)BM(7)BM(54)BM(18)BM(37)BM(33)BM(11)BM(17)BM(10)BM(21)BM(62)BM(20)BM(16)BM(20)BM(7)BM(40)BM(17)BM(92)RP4(676)-E(0xb1a53de0676)}

To translate: we're calling BuildModel a ton of times during the same event without ever returning to the event loop. The sum of all of the BuildModel calls is quite a lot and could explain the loss of responsiveness.

I realized that what this probably means is that we're executing a script with many calls to document.write() each of which calls into nsParser::BuildModel. In this case the parser won't ever interrupt (and even when it's done parsing we won't get all the way back out to the event loop). We could verify this by adding a printf around nsParser::ResumeParse to make sure that we're not sticking around in ResumeParse forever but actually entering and exiting the parser code.",9,"0"

Shu thinks we don't need a GC here anymore. Instead we can get away with a CellIter over JSScripts and something to discard JIT code. That should mostly fix the Firebug issue.

Under some circumstances doing a search on tripadvisor for a hotel for example scole inn and then clicking on the search result will crash camino.  The following error will appear in the console: camino[304] Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSRangeException: *** -[NSCFArray objectAtIndex:]: index (1) beyond bounds (1)]. I encountered this in normal browsing but it's easiest to reproduce a similar or same crash following steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start with clean profile following procedure in Camino FAQ or use troubleshoot camino
2.Set preference Open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows
3.Go to tripadvisor.com and search for scole inn and select first search result
4. Click Window and note presence of hidden popunder window. The presence of the popunder window seems needed to produce a crash.
5. Go to preferences and select Tab bar always stays visible.
Actual Results:  
On my system Camino will crash.

Expected Results:  
Tab Bar is displayed. I am not sure how Camino is supposed to handle the hidden window that is already there when you select always display tab bar or how Camino is expected to handle a popunder window if the open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows preference has been selected.

The tripadvisor site sets a cookie call CommercePopUnder and the presence of this cookie and value seems to have something to do with the crash. For example Camino will NOT crash if the cookie is present with the value SuppressAll.",1,"0"
"BUGZILLA-26074","Ability to limit search by number of Comments","Requested: a way to limit searches to just those bug reports to which no
additional comments have been made since they were reported.

The bugs that most need attention on the Browser-General list are those
that have been in the database for some time but nobody has added any comments
to yet. Among the bugs one or more weeks old most have had some comment added
so at present there is no good way to zero in on these bugs.

Now that boolean charts have been added it would always be possible to
AND a search with the bugs that do not contain the string
-- Additional Comments From but that would be brutally expensive.

Since it probably isn't going to ever be necessary to know the number of
comments added this would amount to adding a boolean field set to 0 when a 
bug is created and set to 1 when a comment is added.

Enabling this would allow both those prescreening older Browser-General bugs

those not already touched reducing duplication of effort.",3899,"1"

As the canvas tag is not a standard anyway may I suggest the addition of a drawString method with parameters for font type size and string. 

In order to achieve usability canvas really requires an equivalent prototype method however the established prototype functions take immense amounts of clocktime and significantly (and unnessessarily) slow down the canvas. The current lack of standard in canvas makes it possible to include a drawString method before it is too late thus adding new possibilities to the object.

get moving on this so we don't taint mozilla.org's image. )  For as much as we
act like an independent entity we are still a mozilla.org product and they
even grace us with a link to our website right on their main page as of a couple
months ago.

We need to redo the bugzilla.org website along the same design philosophy... 
i.e. the main page should make it very easy for people to find out what Bugzilla
is where to get it and where to go for more resources.

Design goals:

We need distinct areas of the site for:
 * Marketing Info - stuff for folks who are considering using Bugzilla
 * Administrators - stuff for folks who get to admin a Bugzilla installation
 * Developers - stuff for people who are contributing to the project
 * perhaps a section for Bugzilla end-users?

The main page should have more marketing info and less news.

I *don't* have time to do this myself.  Some ways you can help:
 * provide design input
 * provide designs (HTML mockups etc)

Once we have a general idea of where we're going we can probably file bugs for
individual tasks and turn this into a metabug.

I would prefer the primary discussion on this to remain on the
developers@bugzilla.org mailing list until we know where we're going.",267,"0"

"NSS-166454","Empty Subject Alt Name extension confuses NSS","bug 162979 reports that NSS reports a cert name mismatch when the server
cert contains an empty Subject Alt Name extension (with an empty sequence
of GeneralName).  I have found that this problem also confuses the name
constraint checking done in the cert chain verification.

RFC 3280 requires that Subject Alt Name extensions contain at least one 
GeneralName and that every GeneralName must not be an empty string.
Despite this there are certs with NO GeneralName in the SubjectAltName
extension.  

When a SubjectAltName extension contains at least one GeneralName but 
it is not a DNSName we correctly treat it as if there was no Subject
AltName extension as RFC 2818 seems to require.

I propose to change CERT_DecodeAltNameExtension to check for an empty
sequence (NULL value in encodedContext.encodedGenName) and set the error
code SEC_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_FOUND if it is empty.

I also propose to change CERT_GetCertificateNames to return DN rather 
than NULL when CERT_DecodeAltNameExtension returns NULL.",0,"0"
"CORE_GRAVEYARD-316691","Support UI bindings for derived datatypes","As it is now we need to target each XML Schema type directly in CSS like we do for f.x. upload:
---- CUT ---
upload {
  -moz-binding: url('chrome://xforms/content/xforms.xml#xformswidget-upload-disabled')
}

upload[mozType|type=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI] {
  -moz-binding: url('chrome://xforms/content/xforms.xml#xformswidget-upload')
}
---- CUT ---

Problem is that f.x. range has a lot of datatypes that it supports (see bug 316354). So with our current design we would need a specific binding for each (and would still not support user defined types). That's not a good solution.

This means we need a method to find the primitive datatype that a datatype is derived by restrition from. I've tried to stay at a distance from XML Schema so I do not know 1) if that's possible at all and 2) how expensive that will be.

Assuming that its possible I see two solutions:
1) Continue along the same path and use two attribute to bind via CSS:
A @type (as we do now) and a @baseType. @baseType should then be set to the primitive datatype the @type is derived by restriction from.

2) Have the basetype check in the C++ part of f.x. range
We could then find the basetype and set the @type attribute to that instead or invalid if it's unsupported. A problem could be if somebody wanted to do a range for an abitrary data type (although this is invalid per the spec).

(another solution could be to push the responsability to the UI control but I'm not keen on that)

Assuming that we can figure out the basetype I'm for solution 1).",331,"0"
"CALENDAR-400407","Conflicting entries in removed-files.in break update process","Testing the Sunbird Update (betatest channel) 0.5 -> 0.7 reveals a problem for the Swedish Win32 version. Restarting SB after the Update fails withe an Error Message. Neither different L10n versions nor platforms seem to be affected.

The problem can as well be reproduced by forcing the update locally w. previously downloaded *.mar files. Both *.mar file types seem affected the partials as well as the complete *.mar file.

Steps To Reproduce (STR):
=========================

1. download and install Sunbird 0.5 sv_SE installer.exe
2. edit Program Files/Mozilla Sunbird/defaults/pref/channel_prefs.js and 
3. change 
pref(app.update.channel release)

pref(app.update.channel betatest)
4. launch SB and trigger Update

Actual Result:
==============

Update is downloaded and installed but after re-start SB displays the following Error Message and refuses to work:

Both the nptl and the linuxthreads implementation of pthread_atfork allocate memory on the fly. On nptl we don't observe this bug because pthread_atfork has an initial pool and allocation happens in chunks of 48 entries. On linuxthreads malloc is called everytime.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run a linux system with linuxthreads instead of nptl
2. start firefox

Actual Results:  
- system becomes idle
- no window no message in terminal
- process sleeps in pthread_mutex_lock(&init_lock)

Expected Results:  
- a browser window opens

Moving the call to pthread_atfork between

  malloc_initialized = true

and

  malloc_mutex_unlock(

should fix the bug.",2173,"1"

If you move an IMG using javascript replaceChild() from an IFRAME whose
contentDocument.location was dynamically replaced the image is reloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.bearteam.org/~laurent/image_reload/
2. Click on reload frame (manual replace). This will reload the time image
in the frame.
3. Click on replace in the frame. 

Actual Results:  
The time IMG above the frame is replaced by the one from the frame ad just
after that it is refreshed (the image is reloaded).

Expected Results:  
The image should not be reloaded.

Tested on firefox 1.0.1.

Other interesting scenari: 

1. Go to http://stan/~laurent/image_reload/ and directly click on replace in
the frame. The image is not reloaded.

2. Click on onload replace. This is a variant of bug described: the image is
moved using the body' onload event. The image is loaded twice.

3. Click on auto replace. This time the image is moved by some javascript
inside the body of the page. The image is loaded in the IFRAME but when moved
the old image is still displayed. It you click a second time on auto replace
the image is loaded twice and refreshed.",28,"0"

After modifying the toolbar and deleting all links the webpage (html) would
start to move up and down rapidly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I customized the toolbar by relocating the Bookmarks Toolbar Items up
beside the menus (immediately to the right of 'help').
2. Then I deleted all items in the bookarms toolbar (the three default links
after a fresh install).
3. I then went to a new website and the entire page (not the browser interface
just the html) began to move 10 or so pixels up and down in half-second intervals.
4. Sometimes going to a new page would resolve the 'bouncing' but by minimizing
and maximizing the browser the problem reoccured.

Actual Results:  
The website would start moving up and down several pixels in half-second intervals.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the webpage without the content moving.

This happened on a fresh install of Firefox not 10 minutes after completing the
installation.",1006,"1"

***

The ProcessData function of the nsXBMDecoder class parse the data of an XBM's
format image.
The bug happens during the re-processing of this image format within the
libpr0n a module activated by default :

At [1] endPtr is incremented until the null terminating character if it's
fill by ' ' space.
At [2] mPos is set to endPtr if mIsX10 and hiByte are null. There are option
taken from the XBM format's image.
At [3] mPos is incremented without checking if *mPos is null.
Thus the boucle at [4] can not stop depending on the state of the heap.

I found it is possible to craft such an XBM image to put the heap layout in
a predictable state and exploit the bug reliably.

An attacker could execute arbitrary code on mozilla firefox if a web page is
viewed or even within an e-mail with a IFRAME tag.

As you can see the image end with a space character when the program assume
the image to be clean and contain end tag.
Thus if one is able to control the heap layout it is possible to execute
arbitrary code.

Here is some details on how to exploit the bug on Linux :

- Use a javascript and allocate a lot of 'local' buffer. I found JC_GC is called
at the end of the javascript parsing before any image are loaded and will free
all 'useless' (because local) buffer.
Thus it is easy to 1) Allocate in some global array a lot of *little bufer* to
begin so we have the heap layout in a predictable state (no hole).
2) Allocate a few big buffer with isdigit()-valid character. Because there is no
more heap hole the 'top chunk' of the heap is expended.
3) When JC_GC return some memory have been freed and thus following
allocation will fall in these new heap hole.
4) When the image is processed the overflowed buffer will be followed by
isdigit-character (this is junk in the prev_size field of the next struct
malloc_chunk). Then a '\0' will be written on the LSB of the 'next size' field
of the next struct malloc_chunk on the heap.
Because it is easily possible to inject controlled character on the heap
(actually that could have been done in the few isdigit()-valid buffer) it is
possible to store fake information on the heap and tricks malloc()/free()/etc
to parse them.
Still in the scheme of Doug Lea malloc (linux) this will end by triggering the
macro UNLINK() which basically insert a heap chunk in a linked list thus
writing a controlled pointer of us to a controlled address of us.
One can simply overwrite any function pointer like GOT entry saved %eip
pointer on the stack and hijack it to point to some injected shellcode.

Exploitation is possible on *BSD / Windows aswell.

See testcase that I'm attaching.

Using this snippet in html:
check #c1
and this style:
input{display:none}
input:checked+label{background-color:green}
you can still check the checkbox and the label becomes green but unchecking the
checkbox (which works with display:none) the label stays green.

Checking/unchecking a checkbox to the left of the original does reresolve the
style in the right way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press button: toggle display radio/checkbox buttons -> inputs have display:none
2. check/uncheck the checkboxes
3.

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
Reresolve the style of the labels in the right way.

 - run directories/manifests as a single chunk instead of everything at once
 - split up a directory/manifest to reduce the runtime of a given test chunk
 - run a subset of chunks on a given device to allow for parallel runs
 - read options from a config file

the confusing part of that is the last argument aPreventDefault. What we do
with that argument and IMO what we do is correct per the specs etc is to tell
whether or not the default action is enabled but the name suggests that it
means the exact opposite of that. This has lead to confusing code all throughout
our codebase code that looks like this:

  PRBool noDefault
  esm->DispatchNewEvent(target event 

and that leads anyone who reads that code to believe that if noDefault is true
then the default action was prevented. But again the exact opposite is what it
really means.

Running the firefox Bash script on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) crashes with the following error message:

  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security
  Reason: Incompatible library version: Security requires version 9.0.0 or later but libsqlite3.dylib provides version 1.0.0

This is because the shell script alters DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH such that the libsqlite3.dylib file in the Firefox directory takes precedence over the one in /usr/lib and the Firefox version is incompatible with Snow Leopard.

Executing the firefox-bin binary directly does not cause this problem since the default DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is being used.

See http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=432894 for some comments about this.  It affects users trying to start the Profile Manager and Selenium-RC.

Either a newer version of libsqlite3.dylib must be included or maybe none at all (use the version that comes with the OS).

"MAILNEWS_CORE-455310","Unfork Account Manager Security Preferences (am-smime.*)","Back in 2003 the am-smime.* files were forked. The differences between these files currently appear to be:

- Thunderbird has View Certificates and Security Devices buttons (there wasn't a bug referenced for these).
- SeaMonkey has a fix for bug 272149 (misleading question when selecting multiple certificates for signing and encrypting mail)
- SeaMonkey has a fix for bug 278549 (Can't configure used certificate per mail identity) the Thunderbird equivalent is bug 252250.

Thunderbird is especially lacking bug 278549. Although the identities system isn't nice it would be good to pick up the fix for it.

Neil has said that adding the buttons to SeaMonkey are unlikely to be an issue.

I can see this being a reasonably easy two/three stage patch:

1) Port the buttons to the mailnews/ version of the files
2) Adjust TB's build system to:
a) pick up the mailnews/ version of the files remove the old ones (note there may be some accesskey/l10n property differences)

"NSPR-30746","Problems with the primordial thread being converted to a local thread in the MxN thread model","In the combined (MxN) thread model the current implementation
of NSPR converts the primordial thread into a local thread and
uses the underlying native thread as an execution entity to run
local threads and the idle thread (part of the NSPR thread
scheduler).

This implementation strategy is problematic when the primordial
thread calls a native blocking function that blocks the underlying
native thread thus preventing the other local threads and the
idle thread on that execution entity from running.  On Windows NT
this problem may manifest itself as follows:
1. A thread calls an NSPR I/O function and hangs in _NT_IO_WAIT.
   This is because on Windows NT NSPR uses the idle threads to
   read the I/O completion port but the idle thread (by default
   only one is created) is blocked.  This can be worked around
   by calling PR_SetConcurrency(n) where n is an interger larger
   than 2 at the beginning of the main() function to create
   additional idle threads.
2. PR_CreateThread() hangs trying to acquire the internal lock
   _pr_activeLock which is being held by the internal thread
   TimerManager (prmwait.c).  The TimerManager thread is created
   during NSPR initialization as a local thread which at the time
   is runnable but cannot be scheduled to run because the native
   blocking function called by the primordial thread blocks the
   underlying execution entity.  I am not sure if PR_SetConcurrency()
   can work around this problem.  One workaround is to create a
   global thread to run the real main function and join with that
   global thread.

This problem has been reported so many times that I think it
needs to be fixed.  I propose that we leave the primordial thread
as a plain native thread and create a new native thread as the
execution entity to run local threads and the idle thread.
This will create one more native thread than the current
implementation does but it will save us and our clients
from wasting time in debugging this problem down the road.",855,"1"

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add manually an event to your calendar file with time stamps (DTSTART/DTEND)

time stamps.
2. Deactivate the related calendar in the 'Calendars' tab.

Reading the MySQL JOIN documentation (see URL) the ON clause of the LEFT JOIN can only refer to the table before it. The ON clause however refers to two tables. Easy fix is to make the LEFT JOIN refer to two tables by using '(' and ')' to make it left join 2 tables like:

Registration is an annoyance that I and probably many other users avoid at all costs.  There are too many accounts in too many places for it to be worth it.  Please allow an -alternate- method for verifying a user wants to try an experimental add-on.

Suggestion: Allow some way for the user to enter the exact add-on name and version as on the title of the experimental add as confirmation that they are in fact installing something experimental.  DO NOT require a valid account of any kind for this method.

Reason: There is surely a non-zero percentage of potential testers who would want to try add-ons and leave 'it works well enough' comments only if they actually like the software or just remove it and leave entirely since the rest of the public add-ons meet their needs besides the potentially not yet useful add-on they just tried.   Testing unproven add-ons for a majority of users is likely a rare thing.  The entry barrier forced by registration and yet another account will surely stop some users who just want to test one add-on that happens to offer a minor improvement they can otherwise live without.

Hi All

   I install and maintain a lot of Firefox for my customer base.  I carry
multiple extensions and themes with me on a CDROM disk.  

   Currently I have to drag them one at a time into themes and/or extensions
to install them.  If I select multiple files and themes and drag them into
Firefox none of the themes/extension will install correctly. 

    Would you consider fixing this for me?

Many thanks

Get to that error message in Spanish (Spain) version of Firefox. That error appeared in my machine while having an incorect TEMP environment variable (it pointed to a non-existent hard disk drive since I took that disk off the computer).

Got the above reproduced error message with that mistake in the translation.

...or even no error message at all! (see below suggestion in Additional Information)

Apart from fixing that small mistake maybe Firefox could be modified so if the user has a wrongly set TEMP/TMP variable (for example a non-existent X:\Temp) it falls back to a default C:\Temp or something like that instead of showing an error message which doesn't even clue about having a wrong TEMP variable (I discovered that was the source of the problem after some fiddling).

Or maybe it would be enough to warn the user about having a TEMP variable pointing to an inexistent disk instead of that generic File not found message which doesn't help much to find what's the problem.",59,"0"

My guess as to what happened is that:
 * we called gtk_clipboard_request_contents with a stack address
 * wait_for_retrieval timed out
 * clipboard_contents_received was called later and then accessed a stack data structure that was no longer valid.  (I'd have expected valgrind to say it's an address in the stack segment beyond the stack top but apparently not...)

It seems like either:
 * the retrieval_context object should be heap-allocated in case wait_for_retrieval doesn't wait long enough
 * we should cancel the request for the contents (if possible although I don't see a way looking at the API)",1323,"1"

Then we go to GrowArrayBy which calls nsAutoVoidArray::SizeTo which
calls...nsVoidArray::SizeTo

in nsVoidArray::SizeTo we have:
186     char* bytes = (char *) PR_Realloc(mImplSIZEOF_IMPL(aSize))
-or-
214     char* bytes = (char *) PR_Malloc(SIZEOF_IMPL(aSize))

Which uses malloc and realloc which come from the malloc family after all.

AFAIK this is a very easy fix: just change delete matchingValues[i] to
free(matchingValues[i])

"CORE-119335","nsXMLContentSerializer::AppendTextData() causes assertion in nsDependentString::Rebind()","I've been seeing this the last few weeks with a trunk build ...

EndPtr' file ..\..\dist/include/string\nsDependentString.h line 86
###!!! Break: at file ..\..\dist/include/string\nsDependentString.h line 86

The assertion seems to be triggered by the following code in
nsXMLContentSerializer::AppendTextData():


    if (frag->Is2b()) {
      AppendToString(nsDependentString(frag->Get2b()+aStartOffset length)
                     aStr

    else {

                     aTranslateEntities
                     aIncrColumn)
    }

The 1b and 2b pointers in the text fragment are not null terminated so you may
want to use something other than a Dependent string or make a local copy of the
fragment contents and null terminate it before using the dependent string.

"NSS-135261","SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE semantic troubles","The SSL documentation recommends that servers that wish to require SSL
cert-based client authentication should set SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE 
to PR_FALSE and then check for the presence of a cert on the SSL socket
after the handshake is complete (e.g. when getting the client's request)
and deny the request at that time if the cert is absent.  

There's a problem with doing that with the current implementation of 
SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE.  The problem occurs when an SSL client has 
previously established an SSL session with the server one that did not
include client authentication and that has not expired.  When the client 
connects to the server again if SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 0 (PR_FALSE)
the SSL code will simply restart the existing SSL session and will not
do a new FULL SSL handshake with the result that the user's cert is not
requested from the client and the client repeatedly receives whatever
error message the server sends back when client auth is absent.  

In that same situation if SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 1 (PR_TRUE) SSL
will refuse to restart the old SSL session and will instead force a 
new FULL SSL handshake requesting client authentication.  But if the 
client does not have cert the SSL library will terminate the handshake 
and the TCP connection which doesn't allow the server to send back a
better error message.  (This is the behavior that the SSL documentation
recommends NOT to do.)

So what is needed is another setting of SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE one 
that behaves partly like PR_TRUE in that it refuses to restart old
SSL sessions if they didn't do client auth but also behaves partly 
like PR_FALSE in that it allows the SSL handshake to continue and
doesn't terminate the TCP connection if the client fails to provide
client auth.  

I can think of a couple of ways to implement this.  

One is to change the behavior of SSL when SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE is 
PR_FALSE so that it behaves as described in the preceeding paragraph.  
That change would assume that any server that requests SSL client auth 
really is going to require it and is not going to allow operations 
(other than returning error message) to proceed without a client cert.  

Another is to create a new value for SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE that is 
neither PR_FALSE nor PR_TRUE.  There actually already exists one such
undocumented value.  SSL_REQUIRE_CERTIFICATE can be set to ((PRBool)2). 
Then it behaves as for PR_TRUE but only on the first handshake on a 
TCP connection.  It behaves like PR_FALSE on subsequent handshakes.
So one could propose the new value ((PRBool)3) to have the behavior
described above.

Comments on the choice of these is invited.

Soon I will attach patches that implement these proposals.",79,"0"

"FIREFOX-412017","[RTL][GTK] Native themed location bar (drop down button) looks bad on RTL layout","Created attachment 296631
fix RTL layout of location bar

When bug 405210 gets fixed the location bar drop down button will be themed natively on GTK. The text field has an open end towards the drop down button so the drop down button looks attached to the text field. However on RTL layouts the drop down button will be positioned to the left of the location bar and the text field itself will have an open end towards the right (into nothing) because its styled direction is LTR.

This patch fixes this by moving the styled LTR direction (which is needed for a correct text layout in the location bar) one child node further.
This causes the buttons and favicons in the location bar to switch place I don't know if that is correct layout but what gave me the idea that this might be the best solution is that the RTL Go button gets used which at the moment is not the case.

There are however other solutions of which I will attach a screenshot.",8,"0"

"NSS-247739","certutil program fails to read PQG files","function getpqgfromfile at label found_match frees the string and then
immediately passes the freed string to a function.  This causes the value
returned by this function to always be null.  

Thus certutil CANNOT succesfully read PQG params from any file.

CERTUTIL_FileForRNG ignores failure to open file and does not report error
message.  Caller (Certutil_GeneratePrivateKey) ignores return value.

CERTUTIL_GeneratePrivateKey doesn't check that dsaparams returned from
getpqgfromfile is not NULL and crashes or generates invalid output.

SECU_GetpqgString doesn't check return vallue from fopen and crashes if 
fopen returns NULL.  Should report error if file cannot be opened.

SECU_GetpqgString calls strlen twice on the same string.

SECU_GetpqgString only reads the first line of the file.  
But Base64 encoded files are typically multiple lines separated by EOLs.  
Perhaps getpqgfromfile needs to call SECU_FileToItem instead.

A related issue is that makepqg generates an encoded PQGParams struct
and outputs it into a file in any of 3 formsts:  binary hex base64.
But none of these reasonable formats is the format that certutil expects 
to read in.  certutil expects to read in a text file containing a single
very-long line that contains one or more base64-encoded PQGParams 
separated by commas (not spaces).  I don't know of ANY program anywhere 
NSS or not that generates such a file.  requiring the PQGParams file to 
be in this screwey format seems senseless and ensures that certutil cannot
read the output of makepqg.

I think a workaround can be made as follows:
a) read the whole file in not just the first line.
b) the AtoB decoder will ignore EOL characters I think.
c) commas can continue to be used to separate succecssive PQGParams in the
file.  

I have a patch for SOME of these problems.",4,"0"

I'm looking at re-implementing some session libs I have from before.  Should do the trick.

This is a chicken/egg problem since we want to use non-default cookie names for NS rules.  We can't have the app auto-setting the cookie while simultaneously passing cache headers.  We need to separate the behavior so it's consistent and predictable for the proxy cache.

Problems with CSS support : I can't apply border and background style (CSS) on
input field

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.try this one:

INPUT.NotVisible
{
	width : 70px

	background : transparent
	border : none
	cursor : default

	font-family  : Arial Helvetica sans-serif
	font-size    : 12px
	font-variant : normal
	font-weight  : bold
	color        : #2e5990
	text-align   : center
}

<input type=text name=text class=NotVisible value=only this text must be
visible>

Actual Results:

When literal containing newline characters serialized into XML newline
characters insert as is into the attribute of RDF:Description. Then while
reading this value from XML parser treats these newline characters as spaces so
writing and rereading of XML leads to lost line breaks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
text_res = this.RDF.GetLiteral(Some \n text \n goes \n here)
this.ds.Assert(this.selected this.rdf_text text_res true)
this.flush()
Actual Results:  
In the RDF file:
<RDF:Description about=rdf:#$XHK122
     otl:text=Some 
 text 
 goes 
 here />



There are two possible ways to resolve this prob:

1) Quote newline characters while serializing literal into the Description's
attribute.  works fine. Heh I've got no idea about possible issues with
different newline representation in different OS could it be a prob here?

2) Serialize complex literals as tag not attribute. I.e.
Some 
 text 
 goes 
 here

Both parses correctly but second is more readable (IMHO).",9,"0"

THANKS for getting the Kerberos / GSSAPI mail enhancements into Mozilla.  

The #1 comment I've been hearing from people testing out these excellent changes
is that: if Kerberos credentials don't exist (or are expired) the user is
expecting Thunderbird to bring up the Kerberos Ticket Manager to prompt for the
Kerberos password to generate new tickets.  

Every other mail client that does GSSAPI does this.  TBird should as well.  

One way to fix this problem is to back the change from bug 240643 out (look for
the lines in nsAuthGSSAPI.cpp) but this would certainly reintroduce the problem
that particular patch fixed.  Another possible solution would be to only apply
the bug 240643 patch if mServiceName did not start with the prefix of smtp@
imap@ and pop@.  There are other possible solutions and I'm willing and
eager to write a patch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This assumes you have a mail server that knows how to authenticate the GSSAPI way.

1.  Make sure the Kerberos ticket cache is clear.
2.  Launch Thunderbird.
2.  Connect to any of your GSSAPI-configured mail servers.
3.

Actual Results:  
you'll get the standard Thunderbird Password? popup alert.

Expected Results:  
The Kerberos Ticket Manager should automatically pop up requesting for the user
to type in their Kerberos password (which generates the tickes that Thunderbird
needs to access the mail servers).",53,"0"

I think this is a cocoa bug but I thought it might be necessary to work around it at this stage...

STR:

1) Apply demo patch and build
2) Start Firefox and open the preference window
3) Hit cmd+?

What happens: A system beep and Help opens
What should happen: Help opens without any beep

This is not an issue in Firefox but it will be an issue for any consumer that doesn't make use of an overlay with the help keys specified in it.

One possible solution is to use preventDefault on the handler - that seems to get rid of the beep. But then there won't be any beep in a pane that lacks a help button of course.",4,"0"

When firefox starts it loads all live bookmarks. The problem is it completely
ignores its own cache when doing so. Moreover it sends:
  Pragma: no-cache
  Cache-Control: no-cache
in http headers thus completely bypassing any proxy that is on the way.
This is a huge waste of bandwidth both ours and server's.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Subscribe to a live bookmark observe that it has (very often) ETag and/or
(often) Last-Modified header and/or (less often) Cache-Control: max-age header.
2. Start firefox use Live HTPP Headers extension to see what happens

Actual Results:

Hi

When I search on Subject or Sender in threaded mode in the main mail window I systematically get a crash when searching for all mails sent by my wife. Lots of other searches go fine but that one blows up every time. I'm afraid I haven't been able to spot another theme or reproduce a simpler test case.

When I'm not in threaded mode the search goes fine (I checked once I say the thread sorts in the stack trace included below from Apple's bug reporting tool).

On a side note (certainly already reported) viewing unread mails in threaded mode has lots of problems - if there are many mails unread in a thread clicking to open the thread doesn't usually work on Windows or Mac.

Cheers
Dave.

According to Margaret Chan if f you are building with debug enabled
then this problem doesn't occur. 

I've done a bit of research on this (and will continue to look at it).

Now if we remove the following from the
...mozilla/security/nss/lib/freebl/Makefile (at about line 164):
 
-ifdef USE_64
-# this builds for Sparc v9a pure 64-bit architecture
-    MPI_SRCS += mpi_sparc.c
-    ASFILES   = mpv_sparcv9.s montmulfv9.s
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY -DMP_USING_MONT_MULF
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_USE_UINT_DIGIT
-#   MPI_SRCS += mpv_sparc.c
-# removed -xdepend from the following line
-    SOLARIS_FLAGS = -fast -xO5 -xrestrict=%all -xchip=ultra -xarch=v9a -KPIC
-mt
-    SOLARIS_AS_FLAGS = -xarch=v9a -K PIC
-else
-# this builds for Sparc v8+a hybrid architecture 64-bit registers 32-bit ABI
-    MPI_SRCS += mpi_sparc.c
-    ASFILES  = mpv_sparcv8.s montmulfv8.s
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_NO_MP_WORD -DMP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY -DMP_USING_MONT_MULF
-    DEFINES  += -DMP_USE_UINT_DIGIT
-    SOLARIS_AS_FLAGS = -xarch=v8plusa -K PIC
-#   ASM_SUFFIX = .S
-endif

and do:

% gmake clean
% gmake

those symbols are picked up from ...mozilla/security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c

In mpi.c each of the routines for the unresolved symbols is surronded by:

#if !defined(MP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY) 
... 
#endif
 
So if we don't remove those lines from the .../freebl/Makefile then 
MP_ASSEMBLY_MULTIPLY is apparently being defined but the assembly file
isn't. Still investigating this.

Now obviously we would prefer to use the specially crafted assembler 
routine rather than the generic .c routines for performance reasons.",147,"0"

Latest version with issue so far: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 6.0 en-US rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081122 Shredder/3.0b1pre

I'm having a problem after installing new TB3 updates on my Vista machine.  After installing updates (from the TB3 autodownload feature) all my mail windows go blank (see attached jpeg) if I send an email it will attempt to login and send message normally but no folders appear.  However opening the profile with Thunderbird2 it opens and operates normally.  This happened once before and I was able to restore normal function by uninstalling the product then reinstalling.  However on this build I tried it again but it didn't fix the problem so that may have been coincidental.

Renaming the Thunderbird app directory and allowing it to build a new profile the folders appear normally with a clean profile.  So I assume there is something in the profile preventing the folders from showing that affects Thunderbird3 only.",612,"1"

Using onbeforeunload with a loop can render the browser useless.

As example:
<body onbeforeunload=for ( var i = 0 i < 999999 i++) { alert('Alert') }
return false>

If JS is enabled and you tries top close the tab you run into an endless loop with an alert which blocks the complete browser.
It may be even possible that you can trigger it automatically with a redirect clause.
It is not a bug just malicious code. IE6 is also affected but i could not get it to work with Opera.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Visit the mentioned site with JS on.
2) Try to close the tab.

Actual Results:  
You get an long chain of alerts and the tab is not closed.

Expected Results:  
Allow to ignore the return value from onbeforeunload and allow to close the tab nevertheless.

If you do not know how to fix it (disable JS before closing the tab) you are not even able to get rid of it when sessionstore is enabled. If the thing with redirect is possible you have to abandon your stored session to use your browser again.",1830,"1"

The former case is relatively easy to handle: nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForChild recognizes the property as creating a stacking context and calls nsFrame::BuildDisplayListForStackingContext which then creates a display item which returns something other than LAYER_NONE from nsDisplayItem::GetLayerState and builds a layer with the right properties set on it in nsDisplayItem::BuildLayer. The element being a stacking context means all its descendant content can be rendered as the children of a single display item.

The latter case is difficult to handle because the element's descendants may be interleaved in z-order with other content that is not affected by the CSS property so multiple layers must be modified for a given CSS property on a given element. For position:fixed we tried to handle this by creating multiple nsDisplayFixedPosition display items and later opportunistically merging them. This turns out to be a real pain for lots of reasons. For example it complicates invalidation and it's complex to make sure that the right display items are created and merged. It also interacts poorly with our invariant that display item (frame key) pairs are unique.

We already have a better way to handle the latter case and we use it for scrolling. FrameLayerBuilder calls nsLayoutUtils::GetActiveScrolledRoot on the frame for every display item to figure out what the nearest scrolling ancestor is and display items are clustered into ThebesLayers so that all the items in a given ThebesLayer have the same active scrolled root. Each ThebesLayer is given a transform based on the scroll position of the active scrolled root for its items. (In bug 876321 and bug 913444 I extend that so that elements with animated top/left/right/bottom and margins are also considered active scrolled roots --- and it works beautifully and simply.)

I think we can keep extending this approach to handle position:fixed touch-action and other properties that don't create stacking contexts. Here's how it looks:
-- GetActiveScrolledRoot is generalized to compute for each display item a key tuple of the values that will determine properties of its ThebesLayer. The members of this tuple will be:
* The nearest geometric ancestor frame that is being scrolled or having its position animated or is position:fixed.
* A boolean indicating whether the display item should trigger default panning behavior when touched.
Other fields can be added as needed.
-- Items with different key tuples are forced into different layers. Thus all items in a ThebesLayer have the same key tuple.
-- FrameLayerBuilder is responsible for assigning layer properties to ThebesLayers (and other layers) based on the key tuple. These properties include a layer transform fixed positioning properties and some new property for touch-action.

The first thing to do here is to rework nsDisplayFixedPosition to basically get rid of the display item and generalize GetActiveScrolledRoot instead.",58,"0"

"CORE-481753","Another potential imgRequest-not-in-cache bug","After bug 481553 didn't solve the crash in mozilla-central I went back to the source code with the ideas I found in that bug and found another. This is a race condition. 

1. Load an image normally.
2. Browsing happens and there are no more proxies for this image cache entry. The image cache entry starts being tracked for removal.
3. The image is re-requested and gets set up with its imgCacheEntry again but *does not get removed from the time-based expiry notice.* Imagelib needs to go out to the network to validate the cache entry.
4. Enough time passes and the image cache entry is removed from the cache by the nsExpiryTracker.
5. The validation results finally come back and the image needs to be re-loaded. The old image gets removed from the cache -- but wait! it's already removed!

Step 5 is a bit iffy since the only stacks I've ever seen for bug 480352 involve Cancel(). I'd expect a mix between Cancel() and the explicit RemoveFromCache in imgCacheValidator unless it's really unusual for images to need to be re-loaded when they're being validated.

TDC Digital Signatur is a solution for logging in to Danish government websites and for communicating with Danish public institutions by e-mail.

There is currently two ways to install the TDC Digital Signatur in Firefox and Thunderbird:

The first method is to export  the user's private certificate to PKCS#12 format and then import it into Firefox's or Thunderbird's certificate store. This method has some serious usability bugs one of them is bug 322617.

Therefore TDC created another installation method where the internal security module is replaced with another module from TDC which can read the user's private certificate from MSCAPI. (I am not exactly sure how that works)

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/toolkit/mozapps/shared/src/badCertHandler.js#59

Firefox and Thunderbird expect the certificate for the update site to be issued by Builtin Object Token. This is not the case when the user has installed the security module from TDC because then the certs are read from the TDC module instead of the built in one.

I am filing this under Software Update but this could just as well be fixed by fixing the usability bugs in the first install method above so that users won't have to install the security module from TDC.

Proof-of-concept exploit

So far I didn't bother looking at compiled GreaseMonkey scripts but maybe I should start now. GreaseMonkey scripts are sandboxed but they still have access to an API that shouldn't be exposed to web pages. In the case of Xoopit for Gmail the file content/xoopitforgmail.js injects _XOOPIT_LOADER variable into the window if that window implements a method gmonkey.call(). That variable has methods like getValue()/setValue() - these are wrappers around GM_getValue()/GM_setValue() and allow writing of string preferences in the xoopitforgmail. preferences branch can be misused as a cookie replacement without all the security restrictions for example. Another method is request() which wraps GM_xmlhttpRequest() - this allows the webpage to make unrestricted cross-site HTTP requests and get text back. The request method has an added bonus - if no_eval parameter is false the response text will be passed to eval() function. So the website can request a script and get it executed in the GreaseMonkey sandbox which will give it direct access to the rest of the GreaseMonkey API.

Which websites get this privilege? Looking at the header of xoopitforgmail.js:

// @include        http://mail.google.com/*
// @include        https://mail.google.com/*
// @include        http://*.xoopit.com/*
// @include        https://*.xoopit.com/*
// @include        http://localhost*
// @include        https://localhost*

The regular expressions that these are translated into will accept http://example.com/evil.html?http://localhost/ and http://example.com/evil.xoopit.com/ meaning that any website can be injected with the _XOOPIT_LOADER variable.

David Ascher reported this Emre was able to reproduce something similar and I can reproduce it this way:

hide the message pane
select an imap folder
delete a bunch of messages by holding down the delete key
let go of the delete key

You'll see the deleted messages reappear and then disappear.

The issue is that when we connect to the imap server and try to sync the folder we check for messages that were offline deleted i.e. have offline delete ops in the database. But if the offline playback has started for those messages they're removed from the database so there's a window where the header is not in the db but the delete hasn't happened on the server.

This is because offline operations are removed/cleared when playback starts. I'm going to submit a patch that postpones the removal of the offline ops until the operation has actually finished on the server. This will allow us to better handle failures playing back offline operations (though we run the risk of getting stuck with an offline operation - which is a bit scary)",2,"0"

The accessible text implementation provides a setCaretOffset method to set the caret position.  For Firefox I believe this should help an assistive technology to write its own caret navigation mechanism.  For the most part (modulo some other bugs already logged) this method kind of works.  However I notice that when setting the caret position to something off the screen the page does not scroll the caret position into view.  It would be great if the Firefox accessibility implementation could provide this.

We are at present investigating the possibility of deploying Firefox as Internet browser in our organisation.

For such a deployment to be successful we need to be able to control the software's behaviour in a number of aspects. More precisely as for both practical and security reasons we have to be able to control the installed version of the software and its plugins and addons any software update and / or installation has to managed internally and distributed centrally. It should not be possible for a user to bypass this process.

The best solution we could find to block a user from installing unauthorized addons is to modify the fileIsItemPackage(file) function in the nsExtensionManager.js script by removing the xpi and jar extensions. This has the desired result as the addon installation is not proposed even if a xpi file exists in the extensions folder.

However we have noticed that simply copying the directory containing an already installed addon from another computer into the extensions folder results in the addon being available in Firefox without any further action. Normally a standard user will not be able to copy to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\extensions but he does have access to %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d8mn5o2t.default\extensions which has the same effect: 

What measures can you propose to block this taking into account that Firefox's profile manager allows a user to create a new profile and thereby bypass any change in permissions that we could apply to the %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d8mn5o2t.default\extensions  folder?

I look forward to your reply and thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

There are several reports of this bug up on the newsgroup - I feel that it is

I created a dashboard chart and then generated and copied a link to the chart.
When I tried to view the chart from the link I got an error in Bugzilla
stating the chart format does not exist with a content type of html.

Clone of bug 458759

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Dashboard report chart. I did Test Run report and Test Results
report with Status on the vertical axis and category on the horizontal axis. I
tried table line and bar charts.
2. Create a link to the report and copy it.
3. Paste the link in a new browser or add the link to a dashboard.
4. Save the report.
5. Attempt to view the report from the saved search tab.

Actual Results:  
3. An error appears in bugzilla stating The requested format bar does not
exist with a content type of html. It did the same for bar table and line.
4. Get a Testopia error stating There must have been a problem saving this
search. I can't find a type.

Expected Results:  
3. Should be able to view the chart from the link.
4. Should be able to view the chart from the saved search.

This was fixed in previous versions of Testopia but appears to have crept back in to Testopia 2.2.

Marking as higher because I need a way to save and link to these reports for
test reporting and status purposes.

The link icon is referencing the incorrect cgi file. When you click to make a link the URL generated contains a list*.cgi file. The URLs should contain the following CGI files:
tr_plan_reports.cgi
tr_case_reports.cgi
tr_run_reports.cgi
tr_caserun_reports.cgi

the correct one.",166,"0"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 de-AT rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113

Mozilla doesn't launch helper applications if they are defined for executable
files in the latest builds (it was possible in older versions without problems).
I use an helper application to prevent an not very experienced user from
executing (and saving!) applications by setting an helper application for
executable files that simply displays a dialog you are not allowed to do this
adds the file to a logfile and kills it. Then I've setted editable to false
for this dangerous mime-types in mimeTypes.rdf. This successfully protected
this user from executing any malware so far. No this save dialog reduces the
security in this scenario since this user is now able to save the file to
somewhere and open it.

Another useful application area for helper applications for executable files
would be an script that automatically passes the file to an virus scanner and
then decides if this file gets saved to the download-directory or if the file
gets deleted.

I've found out that this is caused by an patch for fixing the following bug:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68279

I completely agree that it's needed to block the automatich Execution of
executables from mozilla (disabling Use default action for this type of file)
but I don't agree that it's needed to make it impossible to set helper
applications for them. If you don't want to make it possible to set helper
applications for executables per default then I think there should be at least
an hidden setting to make it possible to enable this via user.js.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set an new helper application for application/octet-stream (for example
open with notepad.exe)
2. Add an .exe-file of your choice to an compose-mail window and choose Send
Later from the file menu
2. Go to your unsend messages open the unsend mail and doubleclick the
attachment.
Actual Results:  
I get the save file dialog even if I've setted an helper application for this
mime-type.

Mozilla should have executed the helper application.",1,"0"

Armen has been able to generate a 64bit Windows build so he has a toolchain that works. The build crashes right away though. We don't necessarily want to deploy the current toolchain across a collection of buildslaves until we're sure generated builds are usable.

I'm going to suggest we try something new/different.

After talking with joduinn this morning we'd like to hook up Armen's single Win64 builder to production-master and have it build nightly builds on trunk. By doing this we can iterate on the toolchain as required trigger builds as required and generate builds and logs for developers to use as we go.

Once we have working builds from an agreed-upon toolchain we can scale this up.

We can put the Win64 nightly builds into the experimental/ dir until they (at least) start up. We should disable updates testing etc in the mozconfig to start.",316,"0"

The code that defines NSS_LIBS and NSS_DEP_LIBS in configure.in uses continuation lines in the variable definition that is later used in an AC_SUBST( ...).  This is not allowed because the build system splits the sed script used to process all the AC_SUBST( ... )'s at 90 line boundaries which could end up being in the middle of a continuation line.

"CORE-25587","Implement OpenType","Subject: Re: Need OT font with ligatures for demo
Date: Fri 28 Jan 2000 09:22:44 -0800
From: Thomas Phinney 
To: opentype@list.sirius.com

In regards to OpenType in particular I don't think there's an
all-in-one-spot reference on InDesign's OpenType support (it's a little
spread out in the manual).

InDesign 1.0 supports the following OpenType features--which may or may not
be present in a given OpenType font though all these features are common
in Adobe's full-featured OpenType fonts:

- The all alternates feature is supported via the Insert Character
function with alternates available in a flyout from the initial character
within the Insert Character dialog/palette.

- Small caps (from lower-case)

- oldstyle proportional figures (proportional lining fugres and tabular
oldstyle figures are not supported however).

- All automatic ligatures in an OpenType font are on by default though
they can be turned off via formatting.

- formatting text as caps invokes the case feature which is primarily
used to shift punctuation to fit better in an all-caps setting this can be
seen as hyphens dashes parentheses braces and brackets shift vertically.

- InDesign supports the full OpenType GPOS kern feature including class
kerning and exceptions.

A few words on InDesign and Unicode:

Adobe InDesign's Unicode and language support is independent of the OS.
InDesign 1.0 only supports western languages as far as direct input goes.
However both Windows and Mac InDesign support import of Unicode text
files and Windows Word files continaing Unicode. This makes it possible to
import a file with (for example) Romanian Russian and Greek text into
InDesign even if editing and direct input in these languages is difficult
within InDesign. InDesign's Insert Character function allows access to any
glyph in the font like the Windows charmap accessory.

Therefore it is possible to build a document in say Word for Windows
using CE Greek and Cyrillic and import that document into InDesign
formatting it in an OpenType font that supports the same languages.

I hope this answers your question!

less.dirty.diff

Split out from bug 646359. After some heavy debugging I realized that the reason why the original patch in attachment 495873 had caused bug 654419 was not what I said in bug 646359 comment 1 but that when encountering line breaks in preformatted text in nsBidiPresUtils::TraverseFrames we can create continuations and in that case we need to dirty the line. This is the last hunk of the patch.

On the other hand I think we were dirtying lines too often in ResolveParagraph (which covered up the fact that we weren't doing it when we should) so the rest of the patch moves the dirtying to points where we are changing or creating continuations.

However! the try run https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=4089c3ced4a8 shows that this breaks layout/reftests/text-overflow/xulscroll.html but that seems to be because of a separate bug which again was beeing hidden by the unnecessary dirtying.",8,"0"

- To get the 1.9.1 branch you must pull the new comm-1.9.1 (when it is created) which will pull mozilla-1.9.1 by default.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View an XML source with non-ANSI characters in a tag name (e. g. the attached

Actual Results:  
In view-source the beginning of a tag containing non-ANSI characters appears in
purple but the couloring stops at the non-ANSI letter and then the rest of the
tag appears in black. When the first letter of the tag is a non-ANSI character
the whole tag appears in black and isn't even in bold font.

"CORE-367467","Allow inputstream generation at the end of data in a storage stream","Created attachment 252027
Patch

var stream = create an empty storage stream somehow...
stream.getOutputStream(0).write(foo 3)
stream.getInputStream(3) // throws exception


The above code fails for a couple reasons: most obviously  and second the uninitialization of segment buffers when the storage stream contains 0 bytes (either with no writes or with an explicit 0 write) after the first condition is changed.

This patch fixes this so that you can get an input stream for a storage stream whenever the given position is less than or equal to the amount of data in the stream -- so long as data has been written explicitly even if the amount of data written was 0 bytes.  It does not allow a getOutputStream(0) immediately followed by a getInputStream(0) which I attempted to implement but finally abandoned as more trouble than it was worth and more than likely behavior the author would consider a bug.  (Note that there *is* a use case for writing 0 and then getting an inputstream from position 0 -- see the URL field.)",49,"0"
"CORE-264274","support dependent strings in frozen string API","Support dependent strings in frozen string API.

I think it was a mistake not to have added an API for this back when we
originally created nsStringAPI.h for mozilla 1.7.  I'd like to propose the
following pair of methods:

  NS_STRINGAPI(nsresult)
  NS_StringContainerInitDep(nsStringContainer &container
                            const PRUnichar *data
                            PRUint32 dataLen = PR_UINT32_MAX)

  NS_STRINGAPI(nsresult)
  NS_CStringContainerInitDep(nsCStringContainer &container
                             const char *data
                             PRUint32 dataLen = PR_UINT32_MAX)

When a string container is initialized using one of these methods we'll say
that it is not necessary to call NS_C?StringContainerFinish.  If dataLen is
PR_UINT32_MAX then the string length is computed automatically.  Also data
must be null terminated.  (We may want to add a flag to indicate whether or
not data is null terminated in case we also wanted to support dependent 
substrings.)

The two main issues this will improve:

  o  enables support for a more efficient version of the NS_LITERAL_C?STRING 
     macro.  Today one must write:

       #define NS_LITERAL_STRING(x) nsEmbedString(L##x)

     This example of course is limited to platforms where the 'L' prefix makes
     sense but that includes Linux and Windows so it pretty much means all of
     our embedding customers.  Today's solution means a heap allocation :-(

  o  enables support for a more efficient charset conversion when starting
     with a raw character array pointer.  Today one must write:
   
       nsEmbedString result 
       NS_CStringToUTF16(nsEmbedCString(charPtr) NS_CSTRING_ENCODING_UTF8
                         result)

     which results in an intermediate heap allocated copy of the contents of

"CORE-433030","[Mac] desired character codes for DOM events with Cmd+Shift","The code cleanup changes in attachment 320103 accidentally changed the
intended logic when CapsLock is on and Cmd and Shift are down and layout is
Latin.  (My bad.)

The intended logic could be restored easily but it seems the intended logic
may not be best.

The original intended logic (before the clean up) was designed due to a
situation seen on the German keyboard layout.

This layout has U+00DF ß (Eszett) and ? on one key.  The ? is accessed
with Shift.  However when Cmd+Shift are down the OS sends the character /.
The original intended logic was designed assuming that this was something
special and that the user might have meant a Cmd+/.  However / is
available as Shift+7 so I don't believe that the user ever would intend a
/ when typing Cmd+?.

It looks like the real reason for the OS providing Cmd+Shift+/ when the user
types Cmd+? (Cmd+Shift+ß) on a German layout is that on a US layout
Cmd+? looks like Cmd+Shift+/ and the OS may use Cmd+Shift+/ to detect
the help shortcut (Cmd+?).

So there are two (overlapping) issues here:

1. When the modifier state is CapsLock+Cmd+Shift the character code (from any
   Latin key) sent to javascript would be the character code that the OS sends
   with Cmd+Shift but the character code that we would like is the one that
   the keyboard produces with CapsLock+Shift.

2. When the modifier state is Cmd+Shift and the key (from any Latin or
   non-Latin key) is a key for which the OS-provided character with Cmd
   depends on the state of Shift the character sent to javascript is the
   character that the OS sends with Cmd+Shift but the character code that we
   would like is the one that the keyboard produces with only Shift.

   (Most often the OS-provided character with Cmd does not depend on the state
    of Shift but with German ß/? and other keys it does.)

 separate bug so that discussion of this issue is clearly separated.)",0,"0"

From what I understood these scraping scripts are submitted by third parties. The default scrapers can be seen in the file scrapers.sql this data is being updated automatically.

Scraping scripts are handled by the file content/zotero/xpcom/translate.js that will execute them in a sandbox (good). However it then proceeds by calling functions from the sandbox directly rather than by using evalInSandbox() (see security discussion at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Components.utils.evalInSandbox#Security). In addition it gives the sandbox access to Zotero.Utilities.Translate class (defined in content/zotero/xpcom/utilities.js) which has methods like doGet() doPost() and loadDocument() - this allows the scraping scripts to make requests to any URL and get the response either as text or as a DOM tree (methods to work around security restrictions when working with this DOM tree are available as well).

The exception is that the 'edit comment as text'  doesn't have a rows
attribute which is required. We set the size using a style attribute. Mozilla
seems to ignore the rows attribute but I need to check if that is guarenteed.
That page only wokrs in mozilla ATM so I'm not worried about other browsers.

The mimetype warnings are all on the fact that we use text/javascript instead of
application/x-javascript. Was this a deliberate decision made for old IE
versions or something? If not I'll fix those too.

having issues with that.

[%# Note: the  tag is unclosed at the end of this template %]

only one template uses this particular template I think its a fairly silly
comment so I removed it. I care because I want gmuck to become part of the

When 'Disable common annoyances' is turned on JavaScript is prevented from
focusing iframes within the page - even though it is permitted to focus other
controls within a page such as edit boxes. 

Since iframes are often used as a rich-text alternative to edit boxes this is
inconsistent.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the above URL
2. Click in the iframe and click 'hello'
3. Click the Superscript button
4. Type 'world'
Actual Results:  
With 'Disable common annoyances' on focus remains on the Superscript button so
that 'world' does not appear in the edit box (iframe).

Expected Results:  
Focus should have returned to the edit box after step 3 and 'world' should
appear there (in superscript). This is what happens when 'Disable common
annoyances' is off.

I minimised this code as much as possible for the testcase (and to still
demonstrate why we need the functionality) but the relevant line is:

  setTimeout(function() {myframe.contentWindow.focus() }0)

(don't know why the setTimeout is there may just be for IE.)

Most likely this was categorised as 'common annoyances' in part of an attempt to
prevent JavaScript from changing the system focus top-level window (i.e.
focusing the current window every second so that the user can't do anything
else). However in this case the change is within a top-level window so it should
be allowed just as you're allowed to focus ordinary editboxes.",80,"0"

"MOZILLA_LABS_GRAVEYARD-477737","bypassing authorized host list change persona from a malicious site","Personas allows the getpersonas.com site to change the current persona while the user is previewing the gallery. It does this by listening for special events and vetting the source against the authorized host list.

The whitelisting intends to allow subdomains of the whitelisted host but does not check that a separating dot exists that would ensure the originating host is a subdomain rather than merely a superstring of the authorized hostname. That is evilpersonas.com and fakepersonas.com etc. can change your persona. It would be easy for some joker to register such a domain and then host persona-changing invisible iframes on various (hacked?) sites.

The solution appears to be to check that the event source is an exact match for an authorized domain or substring matches the authorized domain plus a leading dot. You may want to consider requiring the authorized host list to be explicit about allowed subdomains through a wildcard syntax or maybe an optional leading dot as with cookie domains.

It's more annoying than an exploit from a quick glance it appears you can only select from personas that exist in the official gallery.

"CORE-376811","Bookmark toolbar folders don't auto-open on hover","On other platforms and on Bon Echo on Mac when you open one folder on the bookmark toolbar moving the mouse over other folders will auto-open them. This does not quite happen on current trunk.

1. Click on a bookmark toolbar folder to open it.
2. Move the mouse left or right to another folder.

The other folder should open but it doesn't.

A couple of things to note: 

You can get the other folders to open automatically but what you do is move the mouse over the opened menupopup then move it straight onto the other folder toolbarbutton at which point it will open.

On a places bookmark build the result is slightly different. You cannot get the other folders to open automatically but moving the mouse over the other folders will at least highlight the toolbarbutton visually. I am unsure though if the places toolbar has the auto-open code for folders though.

the code that loads the freebl DSO allocates and then leaks a

I can see several ways to fix this:

a) free it in freebl_LoadDSO prior to returning PR_SUCCESS or 

b) have a static BLLibrary structure instead of dynamically allocating 
and freeing it or 

c) keep a static copy of the pointer to the BLLibrary and have 
BL_Cleanup() (a function down at the bottom of loader.c) call 
bl_UnloadLibrary with it.  In this case the PRCallOnce flag in
freebl_RunLoaderOnce should also be cleared by BL_Cleanup so that

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.1 de rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

In the German localization the Add-Ons entry in the Extras menu can be accessed by pressing Alt-X (for the extras menu) & (Alt-)A for Add-ons.

This choice of an accelerator key is annoying for two reasons:
1. A doesn't activate the menu item if adblock is installed because of an duplicate shortcut.

2. More importantly in Thunderbird the Add-ons entry is mapped to D. So in Thunderbird you press Alt-X D to get the Add-ons list.


I'd suggest to change FF's German shortcuts:

- Use O or W for Download (currently mapped to D but the Download list has a shortcut of its own anyway)

- Use D for Add-ons (at least for consistency with Thunderbird)

When using text zoom (option checked in view menu) and using the mouse scroll buttons to zoom the zoom will be allowed both higher and lower than the maximum and minimum zoom.  Then it seems to realize that you've exceeded the limit and redraws at the min/max or sometimes a step above or below the min or max.

If you zoom out quite quickly for example the page can flip down several zoom levels and appear very small then flip back to the maximum zoom level.

Contrast that to the full zoom which will not zoom outside the limits at all.  It's rock solid.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set text zoom View->Zoom->Text Zoom Only
2. Navigate to a text-heavy page
3. Use Ctrl-Mouse Scroll to zoom to minimum and maximum
4. Attempt to zoom beyond minimum and maximum
Actual Results:  
Observe flash to incorrect zoom level then back to correct min or max

When the example file above is saved as test.html and opened in Firefox it renders incorrectly including a spurious line break.
When the <!DOCTYPE... element is removed from the example file above and it is saved as test.html and opened in Firefox it renders correctly.

Curiously copying and pasting from the bad page will paste it without the linebreak e.g. in the Actual Results field below where I had to add the break by hand. This occurs when pasting as text into other applications as well.

The extra linebreak does not occur in the outer  element.

"CORE-76198","Threadpool optimistically kills worker threads","SUMMARY

The threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number 
of threads is greater than the minimun limit.  

The file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads.  During startup 
there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity.  For every file that 
is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool.  The file 
transport sets min and max number for the number of threads.  The current logic 
in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the 
limit. When the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any 
pending requests.  If there are none and there are more threads in the 
threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits.  

Because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool.  The file 
transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant 
threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are 
primarly needed for startup.

Another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any 
additional request that may come in.  

For example:

From a normal startup to ftp://ftp.netscape.com.org there are 73 new threads 
created and 72 threads deleted.  (This is completely insane) After putting a 5 
second wait there are only 13 new threads created and 12 deleted.  This removes 
60 thread creation/deletions.  

Going to http://www.mozilla.org creates 49 threads.  Adding a 5 second delay 
reduces this to creating only 6 threads.

Clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so 
that we don't get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start.

I am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time.  I ran some basic 
timing tests.  On a P3 dual 500 (windows 2k 128mb ram) it take only 2ms to 
create 10 threads. However this is not a accurate picture since creation of a 
thread doesn't really do much but schedules it.  I also looked at how long it 
takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running.  The data indicates 
that it takes longer as there are more threads.  With 3 threads present it 
takes on average 200 milliseconds from the time PR_CreateThread() is called to 
the time the user defined function is entered and does a printf().  Maybe 
somebody here has better knowledge of thread startup preformance.

Scenario is where HTML page has (a) table with border-collapse: collapse (b)
two alternate stylesheets one with no cell borders and the other with cell
borders.     
When switching from the alternate stylesheet with no cell borders to the
stylesheet with cell borders the table borders are not restored.
This doesn't seem to happen with every test case but where it happens it
happens consistently.  [I'll need to upload a simple test case to demonstrate.]

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In the test case view the page and note the cells have 2px black borders.
2.  Switch to the alternate stylesheet No Cell Border.  
    Note that the cells now have no borders.
3.  Switch back to the stylesheet Cell Border.  
    Note that the cell borders are not restored on the top table
    only on the bottom table.

Actual Results:  
The 2px cell borders were not restored on the top table.

To restore the cell borders on the top table you need to

So here's the bug and a proposed patch. I chose J as the letter for object signing because both O and S are already used and J occurs in both obJect as well as in Jar - where such a cert also tends to be used...

In addition I added a diagnostic message when an incorrect option is supplied - with the current version certutil -V will just fail silently (it won't produce any output).

Finally I'm not sure if any other cert usage (besides ObjectSigner) should be added too... for the sake of completeness these are the remaining ones:

    certUsageSSLCA = 3
    certUsageUserCertImport = 7

Most text editors will save a file by either:

- writing out a new copy then renaming it over top of the old one or
- renaming the old file to a backup name then writing out a new copy

In either case the name now addresses a new inode and this seems to make mozilla sad on OS X.  If I reload it claims that the file is not found.  If I go to the URL bar and press enter it finds it back again.

If I go Back then Forward then Reload it works properly.  This would seem to suggest that something is being cached that gets used during Reload but discarded during Back/Forward or using the URL bar.

It doesn't always happen -- for example if I try it on the first local page I visit it doesn't seem to reproduce.  But if I click a link to another local page replacing that second page will reproduce.

"MAILNEWS_CORE-472005","Bayes trait analysis sees keyword header which biases the evaluation","The bayesian filter tokenizer currently sees headers that are set by mailnews itself such as the keywords header. This causes some strange feedback effects particularly in the case of applying soft tags. Since the existance of the keyword itself is obviously a very strong indicator for soft tagging with that header then whether the header is present or not has a strong effect on the calculated trait match percent. This causes after-the-fact trait bayesian percentage calculations to differ dramatically in some cases from the cases where the filter is applied during normal message reciept which is very confusing.

It is actually worse than that. The most common time when you train with a keyword applied is when you are correcting a false positive. In that case the presence of the keyword in the message is an anti-indicator of the need for the keyword. This causes an oscillation in values as the keyword is removed if present or placed if absent on subsequent after-the-fact calculations.

I need to decide whether to hard-wire the tokenizer to ignore headers set by mailnews itself or implement some sort of interface to allow extensions to manipulate the tokenizer.",32,"0"

Problem first found when developing a Microsoft Access database.
There is a facility to email a list of people from the database. A process reads
every record puts all the email addresses into a variable (varEmail) and sends
the variable to the Email program with this VBA code:

DoCmd.SendObject acSendNoObject   varEmail

The default Email program will open and place all the addresses into the To
line. The user may then complete the email message and send.

This procedure should work with any MAPI compliant email program. It works well
with Outlook Outlook Express and Eudora.

However with Thunderbird Access returns and error message that there were Too
many message recipients. There are in fact about 150 addresses. I can cut and
paste the entire list into Thunderbird's address line it just will not accept
that many addresses from Access. Note: I did not actually send the message - not
wanting to upset all those users. I refer to an already logged bug - 113251
which may yet cause problems with too many recipients.

The process works with Thunderbird if there are not too many recipients eg 50

Also noted by another user: when cut/paste more than 200 addresses Thunderbird
responds with the following message:
The size of the message you are trying to send exceeds a temporary size limit
of the server. The message was not sent try to reduce the message size and try
again. The server responded: Too many recipients.

When doing an insecure submit for the first time (for example when entering a
search term in http://www.google.com/) a warning dialogue appears with a
checkbox allowing you to see such warnings in the future disabled. When a
submission occurs and the checkbox is left blank further searches will
naturally not prompt further warnings. On the other hand when the box is
checked the dialog will appear again during a second submission.

The problem lies in that when the dialog appears for the second time the
checkbox is blank again forcing the security conscious user to have to check it
after each submission and eventually making him desist.

A workaround is to enter as a URL about:config and make
security.warn_submit_insecure.show_once false (and if necessary make
security.warn_submit_insecure true again).

This bug makes the PAB messy and makes users crazy.

In this case it's very difficult to explain them how to use efficiently the PAB. 

So this is an important bug because it creates some distrust opposite Thunderbird.

A note on the existing code:
I'm surprised that nsAbsoluteContainingBlock::ReflowAbsoluteFrame

Is there a reason for this?


------- Additional Comment #33 From Boris Zbarsky  2004-10-03 18:16 PDT 
> I'm surprised that nsAbsoluteContainingBlock::ReflowAbsoluteFrame
> is called twice

The first call is because we have a reflow command for the absolute list
(reflows all dirty absolute frames) and the second is because the reflow path
contains one of our child frames right?  Could we flip those two chunks around?
 Presumably any frames we flow because they're in the reflow path would get
marked clean after the reflow and we wouldn't flow them twice?  Would that screw
up the eReflowReason_Initial twiddling in the dirty block though?

Alternately could we prune frames we reflow because they're dirty from the path
so that they're ignored in the second block?",906,"1"
