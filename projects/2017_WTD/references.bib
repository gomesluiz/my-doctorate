@article{Runeson2009,
abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

@article{DeJonge2013,
abstract = {Data cleaning, or data preparation is an essential part of statistical analysis. In fact, in practice it is often more time-consuming than the statistical analysis itself. These lecture notes describe a range of techniques, implemented in the R statistical environment, that allow the reader to build data cleaning scripts for data suffering from a wide range of errors and inconsistencies, in textual format. These notes cover technical as well as subject-matter related aspects of data cleaning. Technical aspects include data reading, type conversion and string matching and manipulation. Subject-matter related aspects include topics like data checking, error localization and an introduction to imputation methods in R. References to relevant literature and R packages are provided throughout.},
