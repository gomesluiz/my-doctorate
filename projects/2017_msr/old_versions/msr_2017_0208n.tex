\begin{abstract}
In the context of Change Request (CR) systems, the severity level of a change request is considered a critical variable when planning software maintenance activities, indicating how soon a CR needs to be addressed. However, the severity level assignment remains primarily a manual process, mostly depending on the experience and expertise of the person who has reported the CR. In this paper, we present preliminary findings of ongoing research aimed to predict the severity level of a CR by analyzing its long description, using text mining techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Best results were obtained with a classifier based on the Random Forest ML algorithm. This classifier can predict whether the severity level will change (accuracy of 93.681\%) and if it will increase or decrease (accuracy of 93.440\%). However, preliminary results were not as good when predicting the final severity level in an imbalanced data scenario.

\section{Introduction}
Change Request (CR) systems \rem{has been performed a critical} \new{have played a major} role in maintenance process in many software development settings, both in Close Source Software (CSS) and in Open Source Software (OSS) scenarios. \rem{Mainly in the latter}\new{This is specially true in OSS}, which is characterized by the existence of many of users and developers with \rem{distinct expertise levels} \new{different levels of expertise} spread out around the world, who might \rem{register or deal with any amount of} \new{create or be responsible for dealing with several} CRs\cite{Cavalcanti2014}. 

A user interacts with a CR system often through a simple mechanism called CR form. This form enables him to request changes, to report bugs or to ask for support in a software product\cite{Sommerville2010}. Initially, he or she should inform a short description, a long description, a type (e.g. bug, new feature, improvement, and task) and an associated severity level (e.g. blocker, critical, major, minor and trivial)\rem{ for his or her solicitation} \mario{evite a palavra solicitation}. Subsequently, a development team member will review this request and, case it is not refused for some reason (e.g. request duplication), he or she will complete the information in CR form, indicating, for example, its priority and the person responsible for accomplishing it. \mario{importante usar terminologia e jargao do ramo: acho que aqui nao eh accomplish e sim assigned for the CR; verificar em outros artigos}

The severity level information is recognized as a critical variable in the equation to estimate a prioritization of CR\rem{prioritization}\cite{Tian2012} \mario{repetido}. \rem{Consequently, it can be a decisive factor how soon it needs to be fixed\cite{Lamkanfi2010}}\new{It defines how soon the CR needs to be addressed\cite{Lamkanfi2010}}. However, the severity level assignment remains mostly a manual process which relies only on the experience and expertise of the person who has opened the CR \cite{Cavalcanti2014, Tian2012, Lamkanfi2010}. \rem{So, it may allow a high degree of subjectivity and, consequently,}\new{As a consequence, it is a process with high degree of subjectivity, and} it may be quite error-prone. 

The number of CRs in large and medium software OSS projects\cite{Lamkanfi2011} is frequently very large. Severity level shifts throughout CR lifecycle (Figure \ref{fig:cr-life-cycle}) \rem{could cause relevant impact on}\new{may adversely affect} planning of maintenance activities. For example, the maintenance team could be assigned to address less significant CRs before the most important ones. \mario{voce cita a figura mas nao fala nada dela --------- REMOVER}

\mario{Aqui ha um salto de raciocinio. Imagine como voce faria esta transicao oralment}.\luiz{One of the techniques that have been indicated in the literature\cite{Cavalcanti2014} to treat this problem is the Machine Learning(ML).}

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied in solving real problems in many areas of knowledge, including those related to CR systems, such as duplication and assignment of CR\cite{Cavalcanti2014}. However, the accuracy of ML algorithms may be affected by imbalanced datasets \cite{Chawla2009} \textemdash  a recurring critical problem in CR repositories\cite{Tian2015}. For example, more than 60\% of CRs may have a "major" severity level.\mario{veja a sintaxe para matching double quotes}\luiz{Corrigido}

\mario{aqui vc entrou de chofre. Precisaria fazer uma introducao}

Menzies\cite{Menzies2008} have developed a method, named SEVERIS (SEVERity ISsue assessment), for evaluating the severity of CRs. SEVERIS is based on common text mining techniques (e.g. tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, Tf*Idf and InfoGain) and on the data mining techniques (e.g. RIPPER). The method was applied to five projects managed by the Project and Issue Tracking System (PITS). - an issue tracker system used by NASA. The average of CRs by projects was 775 and \luiz{The f-measures have gotten by severity level were: (2) 78\%-86\%; (3) 68\%-98\%; (4) 86\%-92\%. Severity level 1 and 5 were excluded from experiment because there was zero or few CRC with this levels.}\mario{Quais foram os resultados ou conclusoes? Em que medida isso eh util p nosso trabalho ou diferente dele?} \mario{Em toda a secao vc cita varias tecnicas e metodos. Discutir necessidade de referencia}

Lamkanfi et al.\cite{Lamkanfi2010} have developed an approach to predict if severity of bug report is non-severe(severity levels:1 and 2) or severe(severity levels: 4 and 5) based on text mining algorithms (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming) and on the Na√Øve Bayes machine learning algorithm. They have been validated their approach over from three open source project Mozilla, Eclipse, and GNOME and they accomplished that a training set with approximately 500 CRs per severity degree are enough to predict it with a reasonable accuracy
\luiz{(both precision and recall vary between 0.65-0.75 with Mozilla and Eclipse; 0.70-0.85 in the case of GNOME)}.

 In another following work, Lamkanfi et al.\cite{Lamkanfi2011}, these authors compared the accuracy of four machine-learning algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) to predict if a bug report is severe or non-severe. They have been concluded that Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial gave superior performance compared to the others proposed algorithms. \luiz{The performance have gotten by this classifier was 0.75-0.93 Area Under Curve (AUC)}

Valdivia et al.\cite{ValdiviaGarcia2014} have characterized blocking bugs in six open source projects and proposed a model to predict them. Their model was composed of 14 distinct factors or features (e.g. the textual description, location the bug is found in and the people involved with the bug). Based on these factors they build decision trees for each project to predict whether a bug will be a blocking bug or not. \luiz{The f-measures achieved by these decision trees was 15-42\%}.

\luiz{Tian et al.\cite{Tian2012} have develop a method based on similar CR reported in the past to predict severity level of new CRs. The comparison between the past and the new CR was made using BM25 similarity function. Their method was validated on Mozilla, Eclipse and OpenOffice projects over more than 250,000 CR extracted from Bugzilla. The results have gotten by them were F-measure of 13.9-65.3\% for Mozilla; 8.6-58\% for Eclipse; and 12.3-74\% for OpenOffice}

Next we explain the common approach to pre-processing textual documents, and lastly, we highlight the three ML algorithms: Neural Networks, Random Forest and SVM.}\new{This section presents basic background material: CR process and CR Systems (Section \ref{subsec:crs}; usual approaches to pre-processing textual documents and text mining (Section \ref{subsec:texmining}); and a brief description of three Machine Learning algorithms used in this research, Neural Networks, Random Forest and SVM (Section \ref{subsec:ml}). Finally, typical Evaluation Metrics are presented (Section \ref{subsec:metrics}). }

\subsection{Change Request Systems}		\label{subsec:crs}
CR systems\cite{Pressman2009} are software employed to keep the recording and tracking information of requests for modifications, bug fixes, and support that could occur during the software life cycle. 

Although there is no \rem{a common sense} \new{consensus} regarding terminology or the amount of information that users must fill in to complete his requisition among popular CR systems (e.g. Bugzilla, Jira, and Redmine)\cite{Tian2012}, typically, \rem{they shall fill in a form containing at least the} \new{a CR form contains the} following attributes shown in Table \ref{tab:commom_attributes_cr_form}. 

\begin{table}[!ht]

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Once the request has been registered by the user, the development team will assess it and, if it not canceled for some reason (e.g. duplication), \rem{they will complement the information with, for example, } \new{will assign the CR to the person responsible for handling it. The development team may include additional information at any time.} All these data are stored in a repository, keeping relevant historical data about the system under development. \mario{este material eh muito basico. Talvez seja desnecessario. Colocar so o que nao eh obvio e eh necessario para o entendimento. Por ex: atributos, problemas de terminologia, historico de alteracao.}

\subsection{Text Mining}   \label{subsec:texmining}
Text mining is the process to convert unstructured text into a structure suited to analysis\cite{Feldman2007}. It is composed of three basic activities\cite{Williams2011}: tokenization, stop word removal and stemming.

Tokenization is the action to parsing a character stream into a sequence of tokens by splitting the stream at delimiters. In this context, a token is defined as a block of text or a string of characters (without delimiters such as spaces and punctuation) that is recognized as a useful portion of the unstructured data.

Stop words eliminates commonly used words that do not provide relevant information to a particular context, including prepositions, conjunctions, articles, common verbs, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, and adjectives.

Stemming is the process stemming is the process of reducing or normalizing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base form‚Äîgenerally a written word form (e.g. ‚Äúworking‚Äù and worked into work). \mario{Vc copiou algum texto ipsis literis? Caso afirmativo reescreva. Isso vale para toda esta secao.}\luiz{a refer√™ncia √© o \cite{Williams2011}, esqueci de reescrever}

\subsection{Machine Learning}   \label{subsec:ml}
\rem{The machine learning}\new{Machine Learning} \mario{So use o the se estiver falando daquele especifico ML.} is considered a part of artificial intelligence area whose the primary purpose is to resolve a given problem using experience or example data\cite{Surya2016}. It can be seen as an improvement over a set of techniques or methodologies which can make a computer to learn by the study of data sets.

% TODO: colocar refer√™ncias.
\subsubsection{Neural Networks}   \label{subsubsec:nn}
Neural Network is a learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and functional aspects of biological neural networks\cite{Russell2010}. Computations are structured regarding an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. 

Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables.

\subsubsection{Random Forest}     \label{subsubsec:rf}
The Random Forest algorithm\cite{Breiman2001} relies on two core principles: (i) in the creation of hundreds of decision trees and the joining them into a single model; and (ii) in the closing decision based on the ruling of the majority of the forming trees which are treated as equals.

A random forest model is considered a suited alternative for model construction for a many of reasons\cite{Williams2011} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Requires little or no data preprocessing, no data normalization and it is resilient to outliers.
  \item Requires no variable selections because the algorithm does its own.
  \item Models resultants from each tree in the forest tend not to overfit to the training dataset because they are built using two levels of randomness (observations and variables).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}		\label{subsubsec:svm}
Support Vector Machine is considered the most popular algorithm for supervised learning and an excellent first method to testing\cite{Russell2010}. It is a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Each example in a set of training data is marked as belonging to one of two categories an the SVM algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. 

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}	\label{subsec:metrics}
From Information Retrieve (IR) discipline, \mario{referencia?} \luiz{\cite{Feldman2007}}the three most common performance measures for evaluating the accuracy of classification algorithms are precision, recall, and F-measure. 

\textbf{Recall}. The recall for a class can be defined as the percentage of correctly classified observations among all observations belonging to that class. It can be thought of as a measure of a classifiers completeness. More formally\cite{Facelli2015}: the recall is the number of True Positives (TP) divided by the number of True Positives (TP) and the number of False Negatives (FN), where the TP and FN values are derived from the confusion matrix. A low recall indicates many False Negatives\cite{Zhao2013}. \mario{Talvez valha a pena mostrar a matriz de confusao.}

\textbf{Precision}. The precision is the percentage of correctly classified observations among all observations that were assigned to the class by the classifier. It can be thought of as a measure of classifier exactness. More formally\cite{Facelli2015}: the precision is the number of True Positives (TP) divided by the number of True Positives and False Positives (FP), as well as TP and FN, FP also comes from the confusion matrix. A low precision can also indicate a large number of False Positives\cite{Zhao2013}.

\textbf{F-measure}. F-measure conveys the balance between the precision and the recall and combines the two measures in an ad hoc way\cite{Feldman2007, Zhao2013}.F-measure can be calculated using the formula $2*((precision*recall))/(precision+recall)$.

\section{Experiment} \label{sec:experiment}
This section describes the experiment conducted to address the Research Questions. As in typical methodologies used in ML studies, it comprises the followint steps: Data Collection (\ref{subsec:collection}), Data Preprocessing (Section \ref{subsec:preprocessing}), and Training and Testing (Section \ref{subsec:training}).

\subsection{Data Collection} 	\label{subsec:collection}
This step in the experimental research encompasses sellecting a FLOSS to serve as the data source, studying and interpreting its data structure, and finally extracting relevant data from its repository (feature extraction). In this research, Hadoop, Linux, and Mozilla Open Systems were considered as potential Open Source Systems to study. \mario{LG: corrigir esta lista; chutei de memoria.} In a first approximation, Hadoop was sellected as a data source of CR records, due to the fact it is open, well stablished, has a considerable number of CRs already registered, uses standard repositories, and was under study by other researchers in our research group. According to [hadoop.apache.org], HADOOP is a "framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is considered a specialized and complex OSS project with many users with different levels of expertise. Its CR repository allows for access to all CR contents in XML format. Everything is available (except change history), from CR long description field (with lines with few characters to ones with many lines), including code snippets and exception stack trace.

CRs in HADOOP are stored in a Jira based repository [\url{https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira}]. Two steps are used to perform data extraction from HADOOP web site[\url{http://issues.apache.org}]: (i) copying CR basic data (e.g. status and resolution) from XML contents; and (ii) copying CR changes history from external HTML pages (this may be important for learning). About 10\% of the CRs collected in this process changed their level of severity at least once.

CR record data from February 01, 2006 to January 18, 2017 was collected.  Only requests from the common module (identifier = HADOOP-*) \mario{ver se o wildcard esta correto}\luiz{Ok} were considered for retrieval. The total number of CR records retrieved after preprocessing was 7129.

\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:ds_distribution} shows how the 7129 retrieved CR records were distributed in terms of severity level and severity level change. Figure \ref{fig:ds_distribution}(a) shows the severity level distribution: 3.6\% have severity 1 (trivial); 16.8\% have severity 2 (minor); 62.2\% have severity 3 (major), 4.0\% have severity 4 (critical), and 13.4\% have severity 5 (blocker). Figure \ref{fig:ds_distribution}(b) shows that only 8.1\% have changed their severities levels during the CR lifecycle. Finally, Figure \ref{fig:ds_distribution}(c) reveals that of these 8.1\% CRs which changed their severity, 23.3\% decreased it, and 76.7\% increased it. One can see that this dataset is clearly imbalanced, posing addicional difficulty to the application of the ML methodology. 

\subsection{Preprocessing} 	\label{subsec:preprocessing}

The raw data previously collected from the Hadoop CR Repository was not properly structured to serve as input to ML algorithms, it was in tidy data format \cite{DeJonge2013}. The classical way to address this problem is to run preprocessing procedures to extract, organize and structure relevant information out of the raw data. Specific scripts were written in R language to acomplish this. Preprocessing tasks were executed as follows:  

\begin{itemize}
 \item Extraction of relevant features: key, type, status, resolution status, and long description of CRs; \mario{title ??}
 \item Filtering CRs with status equals to Closed and resolution equals to Fixed and Implemented. 
 \item Merging CR features with their change history data. This additional information allows for the identification of CRs that have changed severity level during the CR lifecycle, and furthermore, if they have changed for better (decrease) or worse (increase).
 \item Performing text mining in the long description field to identify the 100 most frequent words. This information is then converted into features for each CR.
 \item Sorting the CRs in ascending chronological date.

\subsection{Training and testing}.  	\label{subsec:training}

Training and testing steps starts with partitioning the already preprocessed dataset in two disjoint subsets: a subset for training, with 60\% of the CRs, and a subset for testing, with the remaing 40\% of the CRs. \mario{falar algo sobre sampling choices??} In the training phase, we have used the cross-validation with 3-fold \mario{seriam as 3 medidas? Ser mais explicito ou citar referencia} technique\luiz{\cite{Zhao2013}}to choose the best values for hyperparameters for each classifier algorithm to use them in the test phase. 


\section{Findings and Discussions}  \label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{RQ1: Will the CR severity level change during its lifecycle?}

The RQ1 is a simple binary problem, i.e., a question whose answer is true or false. The Table \ref{tab:metrics_for_rq1} shows the performance (in percentage) of the classifiers to predict the response to this issue.

We tested the classifiers with 2851 (40\% of 7129) CR: 2620 have changed their severity level, and 231 haven't changed their severity level. We can observe that the three classifiers performed very closely. However, the Random Forest classifier have achieved a F1-Measure somewhat better than the two others. \luiz{About the related works, the value of the F-measure of the three classifiers was better, although the research questions are not identical.}

Regarding the Random Forest classifier we have done one step further, we have investigated its performance relating to the number of hits and errors made in answer to RQ1. The Figure \ref{fig:rf_performance_for_q1} indicates that its accuracy was 93.681\% (2676 divide by 2851).

\subsection{RQ2: Will the CR severity level increase, decrease or remain the same during its lifecycle}

The RQ2 poses a problem more difficult than a previous question. It is a question with three possible responses related to severity level: (-1) it has decreased; (0)  it has remained; and (1) it has increased. The Table \ref{tab:metrics_for_rq2} shows the performance (in percentage) of the classifiers to predict the response to this issue.

We have tested the classifiers with 2851 (40\% of 7129) CRs. Only now, we have three predicting situations: 2620 haven't changed their severity level, 177 have increased their severity level, and 54 have decreased their severity level. We can observe in the Table \ref{tab:metrics_for_rq2} which the classifiers also performed very closely as question 1. However, the Random Forest classifier have achieved F-Measure somewhat better than the two others.

Like as in the RQ1, we have done one step further regarding the best classifier, we have investigated its performance, observing the number of correct and incorrect answers on the test dataset as a whole. The Figure \ref{fig:rf_performance_for_q2} indicates that its accuracy was 93.440\% (2664 divide by 2851) in the RQ2 prediction.

\subsection{RQ3: What will the CR severity level at the end of its lifecycle?}

The RQ3 is a problem much harder than other two. It is a question with five responses related to severity level: (1) trivial; (2) minor; (3) major; (4) critical; and (5) blocker. The Table \ref{tab:metrics_for_rq3} shows the performance (in percentage) of the classifiers to predict the response to this issue.

We have tested the classifiers with 2851 (40\% of 7129) CRs. Only now, we have six predicting situations: 101 are trivial; 479 are minor; 1774 are major; 112 are critical; 382 are a blocker. We can observe in the Table \ref{tab:metrics_for_rq2} which the classifiers also performed very closely as questions 1 and 2. However, the Random Forest classifier have achieved a F1-Measure somewhat better than the two others. \luiz{the value of the F-measure this classifier was better than \cite{Tian2012} and not as good as \cite{Menzies2008}.}

Like as in the RQ1 and RQ2, we have done one step further regarding the best classifier, we have investigated its performance, observing the number of correct and incorrect answers on the test dataset as a whole. The Figure \ref{fig:rf_performance_for_q3} shows three graphs. The graph (a) shows user range error in the assignment of severity level. The graph (b) shows the classifier error in the assignment of severity level. And the graph (c) compares de Predictor Error (PE) with User Error (UE) in terms of the amount of CR whose predictions. We can note that the random forest performance was also 68,08\% (1941 divide by 2851).

Although we can consider that accuracy a good value, the graph (a) shows that user accuracy was 91.18\% and graph (c) also shows that 745 CRs, the PE was greater than UE. From a business vision, the predictor have not show suitable performance.

\section{Threats to Validity}   \label{threats}
Runeson \cite{Runeson2009} recommends that threats to validity should be considered under four aspects: construct validity;  internal validity; external validity; and reliability.

\textbf{Construct validity}. Despite existing others metrics to evaluate classifiers\cite{Facelli2015}, which could be more suitable than precision, recall and F1-measure, we prefer to use them because they have been used satisfactorily in related works\cite{Menzies2008, Lamkanfi2010, Lamkanfi2011, ValdiviaGarcia2014}.


\textbf{Internal validity}. We assume that level of severity assignment by the user is correct and that there is an intimate relationship between it and the long description of the CR. This assumption finds echo or support in \cite{Lamkanfi2010, Tian2012}

\textbf{External validity}. We have considered one single repository and we have extracted 8858 CRs from it. Although we can't generalize the results to others, the characteristics presented by HADOOP repository, particularly regarding the balance of the data, are similars to those shown in the repositories studied\cite{Lamkanfi2010, Lamkanfi2011, Tian2012,ValdiviaGarcia2014}.

\textbf{Reliability}. The code developed in the Java language and the R language for preprocessing, training, testing and analysis of results have been carefully checked may contain bugs. To minimize this problem, we rely heavily on libraries offered by them such as XStream (the XML parser), nnet (a neural network R implementation), randomForest (a random forest R implementation) and e1071 (a SVM R implentation). 

\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we assess the Neural Network, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, three popular ML algorithms to CR severity level in imbalanced data scenario. We have considered the CR long description as the main factor to
this prediction. The features of machine learning were derived from
words (token) from this description. The results on a dataset consisting more than
8,000 CR from Hadoop have shown that random forest performed well to predict the severity level will change and whether severity will increase or decrease with reasonable accuracy, around 93.681\% and 93.440\% respectively. However, it has provided the accuracy (around 68,08\%) to predict the final last severity level on imbalanced data scenario.
