CORE-10209,1999-07-20,Layout: Tables,CORE,problems with absolute or fixed position on table [ABS POS] [FIX POS],"The above URL ( http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/test/sec1704b ) shouldn't
work completely until bug 2479 is fixed.  However there may be some other
problems here too so I'm filing a separate bug.

The page involves fixed position on a table (same thing happens for absolute).
What should happen is:

1) fixed/absolute positioned table gets display: block
2) anonymous element with display table is put around the table (bug 2479)
3) you get a fixed positioned table

The problem in (2) is usually that the content is deleted rather than making an
anonymous box.  So this makes me think (1) isn't happening correctly or
something else weird is happening.  You may want to wait on this bug until 2479
is fixed though.

Right now the table is being absolutely positioned above and to the left of its
natural position.

The above URL also gives the following assertions when I load the page:

NSPR-10334,1999-07-22,NSPR,NSPR,[PP] Startup time on Mac abysmal due to threading and file i/o issues,"Due to the current performance of the threading system on the Mac we're
experiencing very slow startup times on the Mac due to the many small i/o
operations.  Here's sfraser's post to the Mac newsgroup on the topic:]

>>>>>
Because I was getting tired of the startup time for apprunner on
Mac I just did a really quick performance check using the
Instrumentation SDK to see where our time was going. The results
are interesting.

One of the slow spots is reading the component registry and I
noticed that breaking into MacsBug when things appeared slow
often showed that I was in _Delay() which I know NSPR calls
when waiting for I/O to complete. So I focussed on file I/O.

NSPR tries to do asynchronous file I/O; you can see the code
in mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/md/mac/macio.c ReadWriteProc().
While waiting for I/O completion it does some thread switching
magic that basically end up calling Delay() for 1 tick. This
really sucks.

Actually this sucks more the more you think about it.
One tick is 1/60 of a second and that's a pretty coarse
resolution to use when waiting for file I/O to happen. It
also means that faster machines won't have proportionally
faster file I/O because we'll still wait for one whole tick
even if disk access is faster.

I tried three different strategies here and collected performance
data from apprunner startup for each.

Case 1: status quo -- asynch I/O NSPR thread switching calls
        Delay.

Case 2: Entirely synchronous file I/O no thread switching.

Case 3: asynch I/O but commented out call to Delay() in
        _MD_PauseCPU().

The results are as follows: these numbers are the time in
milliseconds spent in ReadWriteProc() and children during
apprunner startp. Most of this file I/O is registry related.

Case 1 (asynch delay)           1142 ms
Case 2 (synch)                    165 ms
Case 3 (asynch no delay)         206 ms

So anything is better than what we have now. For reading
and writing files in large chunks (which we don't do very
often currently) asynchronous file I/O is obviously a
good thing.

CORE-105853,2001-10-20,XUL,CORE,new  has some navigation problems,"I have used a test case wizardtest.xul (will post in the next update) &
triggered wizard from MailNews.

Procedure followed to add and trigger the wizard :

Added to new test case i.e. wizardtest.xul (will post in the next update) as
messsenger.jar and opened it in place of accountwizard (modifying chrome urls in
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/base/prefs/resources/content/accountUtils.js#185
to point to wizardtest.xul) from AccountCentral page (or you can use
Tasks->Mail&Newsgropus->Mail&Newsgroups Account Settings->New Account).

Here are the set of navigation issues I have noticed :

1. Hitting 'Enter' sometimes jumps ahead 2 pages. Noticed consistently when
focus  is lost initially and gained via cancel button activity. 
OK case : Navigation is fine with mouse clicks.

2. Hitting 'Enter' on back button jumps 2 pages back consistently. 
OK case : Navigation is fine with mouse clicks.

3. Clicking on Cancel+OK using mouse does not close the window. 
OK case : Tabbing onto Cancel and hitting OK closes the window.

4. Clicking on Finish using mouse does not close the window.
OK case : Tabbing onto Finish and hitting 'Enter' closes the window.

5. Looks like there is call to window.close() on when the last page is displayed
while navigating using tabs & 'Enter'. It seems to be a failed case. Otherwise
window would have been closed. Found via debug statements in wizard.xml.
OK case : Mouse click navigation doesn't do this.

6. Clicking on 'X' of the wizard window gives the following js exception

************************************************************
* Call to xpconnect wrapped JSObject produced this error:  *

************************************************************

do I need an explicit handlers similar to onclose handler..?

7. Hitting 'Escape' button or click/hitting on 'Cancel' button gets confirmation
dialog with focus on 'OK' button. Now tab onto 'Cancel' button on this
confirmation dialog. Hit 'Enter'. Wizard is closed. It shouldn't close.
OK case : Clicking on 'Cancel' button on confirmation window does not close the
wizard window.

DIRECTORY-11103,1999-08-02,PerLDAP,DIRECTORY,Typos in PerLDAP docs.,"While perusing the http://www.perldap.org docs I noticed that the docs
for the conn module contain the following error:

modifyRDN

       This will rename the specified LDAP entry by modifying it's RDN.
For example:

           $rdn = uid=fiel ou=people dc=netscape dc=com;
           $conn->modifyRDN($rdn $entry->getDN());

Should be something like:

modifyRDN
       Assume a DN of uid=leif ou=people dc=netscape dc=com that
you want to rename to
       uid=fiel ou=people dc=netscape dc=com.
       This will rename the specified LDAP entry by modifying it's RDN.
For example:

           $rdn = uid=fiel;
           $conn->modifyRDN($rdn $entry->getDN());

If you do it by the docs you'll get an operations error (vbecause it
only wants the RDN attribute not the whole DN).

Also LDAPMODIFY provides for a deleteoldrdn parmameter.  This allows
you to specify whether or not to delete the attribute associated with
the old RDN.  Does the PerLDAP function have such functionality?  I see
that the default behavior is equivilant to deleteoldrdn: 1 (nuke the
old RDN attribute from the entry).  This is probably the best default
(since it's what you would probably want to do most of the time anyway).
 But it might be nice (if it's not there) to have the option to leave
the old attribute intact.


Secondly

In the Entry module docs:

setDN

Set the DN to the specified value. Only do this on new entries it will
not work well if you try to do this on an existing entry. If you wish to
renamed an entry use the

Should read:

Set the DN to the specified value. Only do this on new entries it will
not work well if you try to do this on an existing entry. If you wish to
rename an entry use the

(i.e. remove the d from the word renamed).

Are you using Windows? If so you need to add

before you print.

This bug is new to Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:0.9.6) Gecko/20011120.

When you right-click a form the Prefill Form Data windows does not have proper
select fields to choose from i.e. the triangle pointing downwards at the right
end of the field is missing; you still can change the entry using the keyboard
but no longer with the mouse.

I will post a screenshot showing the problem.

BUGZILLA-120817,2002-01-18,Administration,BUGZILLA,Log Out and %commandmenu% in bannerhtml,"With %commandmenu% in bannerhtml logging out from Bugzilla gives back the 
relogin page with the Log Out on header and Log In on the footer.

Steps to reproduce:
Add %commandmenu% in bannerhtml. Save the change. Navigate to any other page in 
Bugzilla so that the command menu is added to the header. Select the Log Out 
link from the FOOTER of the page. The relogin page is displayed with Log Out in 
the header command menu and Log In in the footer.

Solution:
This occurs because relogin.cgi calls delete $::COOKIE{Bugzilla_login}; after 
calling PutHeader (Relogin); This means that the call to quietly_check_login
() within GetCommandMenu() returns 1 and GetCommandMenu() displays the Log Out 
option.

Hi Leif

Thanx for the reply. Do you think if it would help if we open and close the LDAP
connections more often (instead of just one
connection for 900K searches) or the memory leaks can only be be stopped when
perl terminates.

  I believe it will have the same problems but it might perhaps help your
application. Some indications are that PerLDAP is
  worse though... :-(. I don't have a solution to the problem yet it's not a
memory leak per se there are two or three possible
  problems:

    1.Large synchronous searches will take a lot memory. This will be addressed
if/when we rewrite it to use asynchronous
      LDAP calls in PerLDAP.
    2.There are known memory leaks in the LDAP C SDK. Make sure you get the
latest greatest v3.1 bits from DevEdge.
    3.There are potentially lost reference counts in the C API for PerLDAP (and
the old Ldapp). Or possibly somehow it's
      missing some memory freeing but I'm not sure how tools like Purify do
not detect them as memory leaks (since Perl
      still has a reference to the memory).


  Sorry.

Instead of rooting we can do timely marking. This is better because it avoids
the lock overhead inherent in the JS rooting call. And it only happens at GC
time rather than each time the refcount on the wrapped natives makes a 1->2 or
2->1 transition.

We might see some measureable improvement in DOM manipulation benchmarks.

it will load fine so that if you switch to the tab you will see the web page.
However as soon as you switch away from the tab it will die as described.

CORE-14676,1999-09-22,Internationalization,CORE,dlopen() bug in FreeBSD 3.x causes problems with components also impacts Purify on Solaris.,"FreeBSD 3.x has a bug in its implementation of dlopen().  If the same C++ symbol
is exported from multiple libraries opened with dlopen() every library picks up
the version of the symbol present in the *first* library opened with dlopen.
See  for details on this
FreeBSD bug.

This bug naturally wreaks havoc on Mozilla components; both bug 6323 and bug
13154 seem to have been due to it though in each case it's been specifically
fixed (or perhaps worked around) by declaring offending symbols static.
However there is enough copy&pasted code in Mozilla that tracking down every
multiply-defined symbol seems an impossible task.  (I don't currently have any
specific behavioral bugs that can be tracked to this though now that these two
bugs have been fixed; so QA can probably take a break on this one.)

The behavior of dlopen() has been changed in FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT; I think this
is why neither of the above two bugs were apparently present on 4.0-CURRENT
machines.

The correct workaround for this bug I think is to force Mozilla to be compiled
with --enable-low-fat on FreeBSD.  This flag strips all symbols except the four
that are required for components (and are opened with dlsym()) from the
component binaries.

Note that on FreeBSD versions prior to 3.3 (or 4.0-CURRENT) you'll want to
apply the fix described in bug 14241 to --enable-low-fat or dlopen() will spew

NSS-158683,2002-07-22,Libraries,NSS,NSS libraries don't conform to Solaris versioning conventions,"Directory Server was bundled in Solaris 9 with NSS library.
To avoid a mess on Solaris NSS needs to adapt to the Library
Versioning conventions of Solaris.  Application Server will
needs to be bundled within a couple months and utilizes a
different version (NSS 3.3.2 and NSPR 4.1.2).

To comply we need to define what functions are public and
define interfaces and use library names that reflect the 
major version (ex. libnss.so.3).

NSS is already following the conventions in terms of creating
a map files by massaging a list of public function lists:

	./mozilla/security/nss/lib/nss/nss.def
	./mozilla/security/nss/lib/smime/smime.def
	./mozilla/security/nss/lib/softoken/softokn.def
	./mozilla/security/nss/lib/ssl/ssl.def

which are massaged by a script in coreconf by way of Makefiles.
For example mozilla/security/nss/lib/nss/Makefile:

grep -v ';-' nss.def | sed -e 's;+' -e 's; DATA ;;' -e 's;;' -e 's;.*;'
> SunOS5.8_OPT.OBJ/nss.def

which is used in the link:

ld -G -h libnss3.so -M SunOS5.8_OPT.OBJ/nss.def ...

Sun has evolved to using higher level spec files that house additional
information including function prototypes.  But the map files should
suffice.

The work to resolve this bug then boils down to the library naming
convention.  Wan-Teh proposed shifting from 

	libnss3.so
to
	libnss.so.3

and pointed to mozilla/security/coreconf/ruleset.mk as the best
place to change the name:

     endif
 endif

This would be the best from my perspective too but its pervasive and
we need to inform those effected and deal with the ripples it creates.
Its pervasive since the change is not specific to Solaris but effects
all platforms.

We could create a link as part of the build so existing linker
command lines with -lnss3 still work:

	libnss3.so -> libnss.so.3

As part of the packaging step an additional link is created
to select the version to engage after installation:

	libnss.so -> libnss.so.3

I plan to follow Wan-Teh suggestion.  The remaining issue is that
OpenSSL is distributed with Solaris too and libssl.so is taken.
Its also clear that libsmime.so is likely popular.

In view of Sun's convention to invent a new name when upward
binary compatibility is broken I propose we simplify life
and use the 3 as we have.  

	libnss3.so -> libnss3.so.3

would be like saying our name is not nss but nss3.
When Stan is introduced the name would change to nss4 and 
so forth.  Following the same convention with the subordinate
libs means we won't conflict with the existing libssl.so:

	libssl3.so -> libssl3.so.3
	libsmime3.so -> libsmime3.so.3
	libsoftoken3.so -> libsoftoken3.so.3
	libfreebl3.so -> libfreebl3.so

(buf is correct but should be len = 4)

the --ss.cur should be ss.cur - 1

When there's no buffer overflow ss.cur will point 1
char past the terminating NUL but if there is an overflow it will point at
the terminating NUL.  So the return value which is 1 less than the
difference between ss.cur and the beginning of the buffer will be 1 too
small in the overflow case.

This may or may not be an OS X bug/feature.  Buttons in drop-down panes are not
tab-selectable even if one button is default selected.  This results in a
forced dual-mode interface where the user has a keyboard option for only one
choice but must use the mouse to gain access to the other option.  Considering
Mac users' renowned preference for five-button cmd-apple-esc-shift-return type
of UI this presents a more serious problem than one might expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Ensure that preference is enabled allowing Navigator to store passwords.
2.  Go to some any site which requires a login and create a user account such
as the one listed above.
3.  Attempt to tab from Remember Password to Don't Remember without using
the mouse.

Actual Results:  
The Remember Password button remained selected and the Don't Remember
button remained unselected.

Expected Results:  
The Don't Remember button should have been selected so that it could be
activated by pressing the Return key on the keyboard and the Remember
Password button should have been unselected.",sfraser_bugs,ely,fixed,1,resolved,4,2005-08-09,5,11,2005-07-16,1013,minor,2

is meaningful only when PR_Poll succeeds (returning a positive
number).  When PR_Poll returns -1 (error) or 0 (timeout)
the out_flags fields must not be examined.

There are two problems that need to be fixed.
1. Documentation: the above behavior is not clearly documented.
   NSPR doc says:
       On return the out_flags field of the PRPollDesc data
       structure is set to indicate what kind of I/O is ready
       on the respective descriptor.
   The comments in prio.h say:
       Upon return from this call PRPollDesc.out_flags will
       be set to indicate what kind of i/o can be performed
       on the respective descriptor.
   We should change On return to On successful return and
   add if PR_Poll returns 0 or -1 the out_flags fields do
   not contain meaningful values and should not be examined.
2. Implementation: the current implementation of PR_Poll uses
   the out_flags fields as temporary variables.  When PR_Poll
   returns 0 or -1 it does not reset the out_flags fields to
   0.  While the caller should not examine the out_flags fields
   in this case as defensive programming we should zero the

CORE-18432,1999-11-10,Networking,CORE,figure out what resource: URLs should really be,"The current resource: URL mechanism maps directly to files. Ultimately we want
them to map to entries in jar files so that our product can be packaged better.
Several issues:

1. We don't want to hard-code the name of the jar file into the resouce: URL
and we don't want a single jar file to look in. Do we have a RESOURCEPATH that
gets searched for entries (a la CLASSPATH in java)? If so how is that path
managed?

2. We've also discussed adding well-known symbolic roots to resource: URLs
e.g.:

    resource://ProgramDir/chrome/xul.css
    resource://PrefsDir/prefs.js

How do these relate to RESOURCEPATH and chrome: URLs?

3. We've also discussed the desire/need for general substitution URLs. I
envision this substitution based on registered prefixes e.g.:

    RegisterURLSubst(Wallet resource://Chrome/wallet/skin/default/);

then the following resource:

    resource://Wallet/CookieViewer.css

would resolve to:

    resource://Chrome/wallet/skin/default/CookieViewer.css

(which would in turn resolve to a file: URL.) Perhaps this is a generalization
of 2 above or perhaps 2 is accomplished by having a well-known and
pre-registered set of substitutions.

Note that chrome: URLs can make use of this registration/resolution mechanism
too.

Perhaps number 1 above is resource: and 2 3 are something else (subst: URLs).
Or maybe 1 and 3 can be tied together by allowing multiple values to be
registered under the same key e.g.:

    RegisterURLSubst(Chrome jar:resource://ProgramDir/Navigator.jar!/);
    RegisterURLSubst(Chrome jar:resource://ProgramDir/Overlay.jar!/);

Using this scheme retrieving:

    resource://Chrome/Navigator.css

would first try:

    jar:resource://ProgramDir/Navigator.jar!/Navigator.css

and if not found try:

    jar:resource://ProgramDir/Overlay.jar!/Navigator.css

Well it is easy: if  type was text or password and new type would be
text or password size should not change it's value form int to pixels. But it do.

To reproduce bug run testcase and press on buttons. You could see that each
odd click press size of input become default size and each even click it become
size=12 again (no difference betwen order of buttons usage).

Source of this behaviour is in file
source/content/html/content/src/nsHTMLInputElement.cpp on line 537:

526     // If the type of the input has changed we might need to change the type
527     // of the size attribute.
528     nsHTMLValue value;
529     if (NS_CONTENT_ATTR_HAS_VALUE ==
530         GetHTMLAttribute(nsHTMLAtoms::size value)) {
531       if (value.GetUnit() == eHTMLUnit_Pixel &&
532           (mType == NS_FORM_INPUT_TEXT ||
533            mType == NS_FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD)) {
534         nsHTMLValue newValue(value.GetPixelValue() eHTMLUnit_Integer);
535         SetHTMLAttribute(nsHTMLAtoms::size newValue PR_FALSE);
536       }
537       else if (value.GetUnit() == eHTMLUnit_Integer) {
538         nsHTMLValue newValue(value.GetIntValue() eHTMLUnit_Pixel);
539         SetHTMLAttribute(nsHTMLAtoms::size newValue PR_FALSE);
540       }
541     }

As you see if we switch from pixels this code check that new value is integer
but if we switching from ineger if in line 537 don't check that new type is
not password or int.

So I suggest to chahnge it to:

if (value.GetUnit() == eHTMLUnit_Integer &&
    mType != NS_FORM_INPUT_TEXT && mType != NS_FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD )

(according with
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-type-INPUT

specifies the maximum number of characters the user may enter. This number may

DIRECTORY-1984,1998-12-18,PerLDAP,DIRECTORY,Crashes on NT when doing many searches,"From: Schneider Stuart 

   Just wanted to pass along another update while trying to use PerLDAP on
an NT4 system.

   After I started converting some of my scripts from Net::LDAPapi to the
new modules I came across a problem where the new library would blow up and
return an Error: Runtime exception after performing between 200 to 5000
searches on the directory.  I've since installed a C compiler on my system
and have been seeing the exact same problem with v1.1 of the modules.  I've
managed to track the call down to the ldap_value_free call made at the
conclusion of the ldap_search_s XS function call.

   As a temporary fix I've commented out the call to ldap_value_free in the
API.xs file and my scripts now work perfectly (although I do notice a memory
leak when running the script - after about 20000 queries the script is
consuming an additional 5meg of memory).

   What additional information can I provide to help track this down?
Personally I'm leaning towards the possibility that this is a bug in
Netscape's LDAP library for the Win32 platform since the same code works
perfectly on my RedHat Linux system.  Unfortunately I have to run this on
Win-NT.

types.  They probably need to be beveled and the widths could be adjusted so
the ends always come out nicely.

I may have time to write this code myself.  Assign it to me if you want.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
 * load attached test case

ACTUAL RESULTS:
 * the dotted/dashed borders show in the gap behind double (and presumably
    transparent) borders
 * at some widths the top border of the first paragraph has end dots that
   aren't as wide as the border they connect with.  The end dots should always
   have minimum length of max(width of border width of adjacent border width
   of other adjacent border)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
 * not the above

DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY ON:
 * Linux mozilla 1999-11-22-08-M12

WORKS CORRECTLY ON:
 * Opera 3.6 mostly

bits of color are scattered about etc. I will upload a screenshot so that
everyone knows what I'm talking about. Hitting Command-A to select all text

scrolling often times doesn't do the job.

CORE-20802,1999-12-04,Graphics,CORE,Should use logical resolution from OS when higher than 96ppi,"From: dbaron@fas.harvard.edu

See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17861 for the Unix source code
changes. Mac might be similar.

DESCRIPTION:  Currently Mac and Linux by default (i.e. without the secret
browser.screen_resolution pref) do not use the logical resolution from the
operating system at all.  Instead they assume 96ppi.  I think this is a bad
idea - they should only assume 96ppi when the operating system claims the
logical resolution is *less* than 96ppi.  If the OS gives a value *more* than
96ppi then the OS value should be used.  (Users with poor vision for example
may have a high logical resolution set.  Or for that matter users with
high-res monitors.  The reason for doing this at all is that the Windows default
is 96ppi and many web designers write pages with physical units that are
illegible with a logical resolution smaller than 96ppi because the fonts become
too small to read.  Therefore there's no reason to *lower* the logical
resolution to 96ppi -- it should only be raised to 96ppi.)  The code should also
respect the browser.screen_resolution pref above all.

I'll try to submit a patch that does this on Linux.  Sometime that is...

The problem
seems to be in the VC++ 6.0 compiler code that calls operator= when
you have
code that looks something like:

    nsCAutoString chromeFile overlayFile;


chromeFile = chrome/;

overlayFile = chromeFile;
 //<------ Here's where the
UMR occurs!

We can get rid of the UMR by defining an operator= that takes an
nsCAutoString&
reference as an arg. If someone code reviews this patch I can check it in:

In an SVG enabled build the Open File dialog should know about svg file
extensions.  In the drop down list of file types and extensions there should be
an entry for SVG files (.svg .svgz) or those extensions should be added to the

BUGZILLA-240004,2004-04-08,User Accounts,BUGZILLA,User forgotten password - system sends email with token - token has bad characters,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113

I am using Mozilla 1.6 amd its email client.  When a user forgets their password
they can be sent an email with a session token to allow them to change their
password.  This token is made up of characaters other than letters and numbers
(in addition to letters and numbers).

The mozilla mail client scans text emails and highlights urls so they are
clickable.  It chokes on some of these extra characters prematurely ternimating
the url click link.  The link brings up a page from bugzilla that states bad
token.  For a technical user this is annoying but mots can figure out what is
happening.  For general users this can be maddening as it seems the system
doesn't work.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Pretend you have forgotten your password and have the system send it to you on
the login screen.  If the url contains certain characters the url link in the
email will not work.

This is an actual example of a link that was sent from our bugzilla system:

http://bugzilla.worldenergylabs.com/token.cgi?a=cxlpw&t=lL9G%2ARB-

The mozilla email client  only highlighted as a clickable link up to the ARB. 
The - at the end was not included.

The session token algorithm should be changed to include only A-Z a-z and 0-9.
 To maintain the same keyspace the number of characters in the encoding will
have to be increased a bit.




The system gets the token from the password routine (sub GenerateRandomPassword
in globals.pl).  It generates 8 characters randomly from the list 0-9 A-Z a-z
- _ ! @ # $ % ^ and *.  This is 71 characters.  The total keyspace of the
generated password or token is 8 * (log 71 / log 2) = 49.20 bits of information.

Option 1: Getting rid of the non alphanumeric characters from the list gives a
keyspace of 47.63 bits.  Pretty damn close and without the problems.  Add a 9th
character instead of only 8 and your keyspace jumps to 53.59 bits which exceeds
the original password routine's keyspace.  (NOTE that all of these are
brute-forceable - you need probably close to 14 characters of strictly
alphanumeric characters which is 83 bits before you start seeing actual security.)

Option 2: Another alternative is to leave the password routine alone but add a
second one for just generating sessions tokens.  These are very short routines
and would not impact the program negatively.

Example:
sub gentoken {
  my $size = (shift or 9);
  return join  map{ (0..9a..zA..Z)[rand 62] } (1..$size);
}

Option 3: A third alternative is to post process the password token converting
it to a bitstring then back out to a strictly alphanumeric string which would be
longer but have the same keyspace.

The second option above is the best",bugzilla,bugzilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-12-18,0,16,2004-04-22,14,minor,2
CORE-240117,2004-04-09,CSS Parsing and Computation,CORE,Native theme IsWidgetStyled needs to stop depending on forms.css,"The problem is that right now we drop theming on form controls if they are
styled by the page (which is a rather ill-defined concept anyway).  The way we
decide to do this is that we look at some computed style values on the control
and compare them to what forms.css says for the same control.  If the two
differ we drop theming.

There are multiple problems here:

1)  Handling platform-forms.css is rather painful without code duplication.
2)  User sheets cause theming to drop (should they? maybe.)
3)  Changes to forms.css require changes to the C++ code in IsWidgetStyled.
    General fragility of code harder to customize the browser etc.

I feel that the right way to do this is to resolve a style context for the
node using only the UA (and maybe user) level and then compare to the normal
style context to see whether the widget is styled (and to clearly decide on what
it means to be styled too).  Hopefully presentational attributes are a
non-issue here....",dbaron,bzbarsky,fixed,1,resolved,4,2010-10-20,0,23,2007-10-09,1278,normal,2

Greg Noel wrote:
I'm glad it's not just me.  I've been seeing this for two or three days
but I've had enough other problems that I wasn't sure if it was a generic
issue.

The first page loads fine but when it's about time for the refresh the
browser crashes.  This happens for both a debug and an optimized build.

The crash does not cause a core dump so I can't get a backtrace.  My gdb
is also acting up (it's complaining about a ptrace failure when the first
thread splits off) so I can't run it under a debugger either.

I'm running MkLinux (a PPC-based Linux implementation) on a Mac 8500/150.

more from chofmann:
On todays linux release build this is what I see after
trying to load a url or two.

Robin Maxwell reported that NSPR is not I18n compliant. He had been tinkering 
with a configuration utility related to NES. He said that when passing a unicode 
filename to PR_Open() that it did not do what he expected.

Historically NSPR has stated that since it did not issue messages that no 
Localization (L10n) was required. Ditto for I18n. So much for that.

Persuing Robin's complaint I found that for at least the Japanese version of 
Directory server on NT that unicode was not used that Shift-JIS was the 
character set. The Japanese version of DS uses the Japanese version of NT. 
Similarly the Unix variants of DS also do not use or at least do not pass to 
NSPR wide character strings for PR_Open(); see man 5 locale. ... At this 
writing NTF ... I will talk to more I18n folks about other products.



------- Additional Comments From larryh  Jan-18-2000 11:59 ------- 

Research shows NSPR behaving as expected. Pramod says he has a test case to 
provoke the reported behaviour but he has not forwarded it to me.

I'll leave this bug open to the end of this week. Absent confirmed failures 
I'll close it as NoTroubleFound.

I'm trying to hook up some progress UI for RSS Integration in Thunderbird. I
was trying to come up with a way to get the http progress event sink
notifications for my running XMLHttpRequest. I wanted to ask for your thoughts
and comments about some ways to do this.

Currently nsIXMLHttpRequest passes itself in as the interface callbacks object
to the underlying HTTP channel. It does not implement nsIProgressEventSink so
the HTTP channel currently does not broadcast any progress notifications.

Here's one approach to do this:

1) Make nsXMLHttpRequest implement nsIProgressEventSink.
2) Add a new event handler to nsIJSXMLHttpRequest called onprogress or
onprogressavailable
3) Add two new attributes to nsIXMLHttpRequest for the current progress and max
progress
4) When the xml http request gets a progress notification it can call out
through the event handler informing the JS consumer that progress is available.
5) The JS consumer can query the two new attributes on nsIXMLHttpRequest to
calculate the progress for this request.",mscott,mscott,fixed,1,resolved,4,2004-07-15,0,10,2004-07-15,1,normal,2

Risk Rating:  Moderate

Advisory ID#: wp-04-0001
CVE:          


Overview
--------

A design goal for cookies is to prevent the sharing of session
information between hosts that are in different domains. [1] It appears
current implementations are successful at allowing a domain to keep its
cookies private. However multiple mechanisms have been discovered for one
domain to inject cookies into another. These could be used to perform
session fixation attacks against web applications. [2]
(14:30:08) Chris: 
Cross-Domain Cookie Injection
-----------------------------
Vulnerable: Internet Explorer Konqueror Mozilla

By default cookies are only sent to the host that issued them. There is
an optonal domain attribute that overrides this behaviour. For example
red.example.com could set a cookie with domain=.example.com. This would
then be sent to any host in the .example.com domain.

There is potential for abuse here consider the case where red.example.com
sets a cookie with domain=.com. In principle this would be sent to any
host in the .com domain. However [1] requires browsers to reject cookies
where:

 The value for the Domain attribute contains no embedded dots

This prevents a cookie being set with domain=.com. However this does not
extend to country domains that are split into two parts. For example
red.example.co.uk could set a cookie with domain=.co.uk and this will be
sent to all hosts in the .co.uk domain. Mozilla follows the RFC exactly
and is vulnerable to this. Konqueror and Internet Explorer have some
further protection preventing domains of the following forms:

 * Where the 2nd level domain is two or fewer characters i.e. xx.yy or
   x.yy
 * Domains of the form (com|net|mil|org|gov|edu|int).yy

This does prevent .co.uk cross domain cookie injection but does not
protect all domains. For example the the following .uk domains are
unprotected:

 .ltd.uk
 .plc.uk
 .sch.uk
 .nhs.uk
 .police.uk
 .mod.uk

Interestingly some old Netscape documentation [3] specifies the following
restriction:

(14:30:29) Chris:  Any domain in the COM EDU NET ORG GOV MIL and INT
categories
 requires only two periods; all other domains require at least three
 periods.

This is what Opera does. It seems a sensible choice as it tends more
towards accept only known good input rather than reject known bad
input a principle of secure design.

Example exploitation:
 1) http://example.ltd.uk/ is identified for attack. It uses the sid
    cookie to hold the session ID.
 2) Attacker obtains attacker.ltd.uk domain
 3) User is enticed to click link to http://attacker.ltd.uk/
 4) This site sets the sid cookie with domain=.ltd.uk
 5) When user logs into example.ltd.uk they are using a sesion ID known
    to the attacker.
 6) Attacker now has a logged-in session ID and has compromised the
    user's account.

Exploitation is dependent on the user clicking an untrusted link. However
it is fundamental to the use of the web that we do sometimes click
untrusted links. This attack can happen regardless of the use of SSL.


Cross Security Boundary Cookie Injection
----------------------------------------
Vulnerable: all tested browsers

By default cookies are sent to all ports on the host that issued them
regardless of whether SSL is in use. There is an optional secure
attribute that restricts sending to secure channels. This prevents secure
cookies for leaking out over insecure channels. However there is no
protection to prevent cookies set over a non-secure channel being
presented on a secure channel. In general to maintain proper boundaries
between security levels it is necessary to defend against both attacks -
protecting both confidentiality and integrity.

Example exploitation:
 1) https://example.com/ identified for attack which uses sid cookie
    as session ID.
 2) User is enticed to click link to http://example.com/
 3) By some mechanism the attacker intercepts this request and sets the
    sid cookie
 4) When user logs into https://example.com/ they are using a sesion ID
    known to the attacker.
 5) Attacker now has a logged-in session ID and has compromised the
    user's account.

In addition to the user clicking an untrusted link exploitation is
dependent on the attacker tampering with non-SSL network traffic. This is
a reasonable assumption as the purpose of SSL is to provide security over
an insecure network.",dwitte,dwitte,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-04-25,16,94,2007-12-04,1232,normal,2

corresponding internal 'langGroup' is not listed in langGroup.properties file)
is mapped to 'x-western'. This mapping is used exclusively by Gfx (and layout)
[1] to determine 'lang-specific' fonts. On some platforms Mozilla can support
quite a lot more languages (actually scripts) than what we have in
langGroup.properties. To control fonts to use for those languages currently one
has to change fonts for Western because by any stretch those scripts are
similar to Latin (e.g. various Indic scripts). Until we add them to our
'supported' list it'd be better to map them to 'x-unicode' so that fonts to use
for them can be controlled by setting fonts for 'Unicode' in the font preference
panel.  This is quite 'intuitive' because most of those scripts can ONLY be
representable in Unicode (if you don't count unstandardized/unsupported hacks
used for those scirpts in the past) and web pages in those scripts are mostly in
UTF-8 (or other encoding forms of Unicode).

NSPR-263,1998-04-21,NSPR,NSPR,Mozilla does not compile on NetBSD/arm32,"Created by Frank van der Linden (frank@wins.uva.nl) on Tuesday April 21 1998 4:39:48 PM PDT
Additional Details :
Mozilla does not compile on NetBSD for the ARM processor
(NetBSD/arm32). The patches mentioned in bugreport #122 make
it work on some but not all architectures that NetBSD runs
on. The following patch fixes this and can be applied on
a source tree that has the patches in report #122 already
applied:
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/diff.002
Updated by Frank van der Linden (frank@wins.uva.nl) on Sunday May 24 1998 4:47:35 PM PDT
Additional Details :
The updated changes for the 1998-04-29 version can be found in
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/ftp/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/diff-19980429.001

This patch combines the patch in report #122 with the one for this report
and updates it for the 1998-04-29 version.

There weren't many changes; just a few conflicts with changes made in the main
source tree were resolved.
Updated by Brian Ostrom (briano@netscape.com) on Monday July 13 1998 3:49:20 PM PDT
Additional Details :
Well that worked well....  I changed the assigned-to field and added a comment
and submitted it... and only the assigned-to entry got updated.  Swell.

Anyway Wan-Teh I reassigned this to you because most of the remaining
changes are in NSPR.  The most recent diff file is in:

SEAMONKEY-26342,2000-02-02,UI Design,SEAMONKEY,focused widgets give no visual cue in Dialogs,"Overview Description: 

  I encountered this while verifying bug 18444. In the Open Web Location dialog there is no visual indication of which widget has 
focus except for the text box. When you switch focus by tabbing through the elements you have no way of knowing which one is 
focused until you tab back around to the text box.

Steps to Reproduce: 

1) Select File|Open Web Location.

2) Click in the text field to set initial focus.

3) Hit tab 14 times noting the effects each time.



Actual Results: 

	Tabbing actually switches the focus as it should. The first time through the tab order the radio buttons do reflect their focus.
The Cancel and Open buttons do not. When you get back to the text field you see the flashing caret. When you continue to tab 
through (second trip around) the radio buttons no longer show their focused state either. For every trip thereafter none of the 
elements show any focus (except the text field it always shows the caret when focused).
The reason I know the widgets recieve ocus but do not show is because it takes 7 tabs (the number of elements in the dialog) to 
return to the text field AND if you press return after the 4th and 5th tabs the Cancel and open buttons fire off as appropriate.

Expected Results: 

	each widget should give some visual indication when it is focused.

Build Date & Platform Bug Found: 

	This bug exists on ALL platforms with at least the 2000020108 builds.

Additional Information:

	I've assigned this to ben for now becuase I believe he did some work on that dialog cc'ing law.",bugs,cmaximus,fixed,1,resolved,4,2004-11-23,0,10,2000-07-22,171,normal,2

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113

In the Gecko DOM Reference check the DOM _Element_ Reference:

http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_el_ref.html#1022767

If you scroll down you'll find the description of possible Event Handlers for an
HTML element e.g. onclick. There's also a link to an example:

http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_el_ref63.html

It states:
  p.onclick = alert('moot!');;

I think that's plain wrong. You can not assign a string to an event handler but
only a function reference. Thus it should rather read 

 p.onclick=function() {
        alert('moot!');
}

Additionally on the DOM _Element_ Reference page the event handler property is
said to be read only. Thats also wrong. And the example - albeit it does not
work - contradicts this.

I have my location bar moved to the Menubar (File | Edit | etc..)
In fullscreen mode the menubar gets hidden as it should.
Since the location bar is hidden I would expect Ctrl+L to open the Open
Location dialog.  It doesn't.  I assume that is highlights the contents of the
location bar which is not hidden in full screen mode. 

Off-topic - I'd love to have the toolbars auto-hide in fullscreen mode...  other
posts have been made about this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click View > Toolbars > Customize...
2.Drag the Location bar from the Navigation Toolbar to the Menubar
3.Click Done in the Customize Window - return to browsing.
4.Press F11 or Click View > Full Screen
5.Press Ctrl+L

Actual Results:  
Nothing visible happens 
(Assumedly the contents of the location bar are selected though the menubar
and location bar are hidden)

Expected Results:  
Since the location bar is not visible the Open Location dialog should appear

The title says it all really. It appears that sorting Firefox extensions by
popularity yields results based on downloads per week. I can see no good reason
for this. The listings would be far more stable if total downloads were used as
the metric. (I would imagine that for most extensions download numbers do not
increase linearly with time and so we have extensions significantly jumping
about from day to day.)

On a related note the use of the word popular is slightly ambiguous because
it is not explitly clear what it refers to on u.m.o. It should be clarified that
it refers to download numbers.

For no apparent reason sometimes when you hover a link the mouse pointer and
the back button will go 'crazy'. This happens when you move your mouse over the
link not just rest on it.

The mouse pointer will constantly shift between the normal mouse pointer and the
hand.

The back button will focus and unfocus itself.

This seems to happen at random on clickable elements. I've had this problem on a
normal link and on the menus at http://www.nintendo.be/

I filed it as major because it can lead to unpredictable behavior that prevents
you to use the clickable element as normal.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse as usual
Actual Results:  
At random suddenly on a page it will display above described behavior.

move around from form element to form element.  This is consistent with most
operating systems and with Mozilla's behavior in web pages.

However the other times this happens there is a dotted outline drawn around
the object that is focused.  In the dialogs there is no focus outline and it is
impossible to tell what element has the focus without pressing the space bar to
see which checkbox or radio button one happens to be on.

This bug could probably be fixed with good use of the CSS 'outline' property in
the CSS skin files for dialogs with the rules in html.css used as an example.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
 * open the File|Open Web Location or Search | Find on this Page dialogs.
 * Hit the tab key a few times
 * hit space bar and if you hit the tab key the right number of times you
will find that a radio button is focused without any visual indication

 * there is no focus outline indicating which element is focused

 * there should be a focus outline

When loading the xpconnect-sample.html file from mozilla/xpcom/sample in the

the user from ever saying 'yes' to requests for priviledges.

ADDONS.MOZILLA.ORG_GRAVEYARD-295628,2005-05-26,Admin/Editor Tools,ADDONS.MOZILLA.ORG_GRAVEYARD,[Approval Queue] users should be able to see add-ons pending approval,"There should be a way for users to specify that they wish to see pending
extensions in addition to approved extensions in the lists of available
extensions on addons.mozilla.org.  Then saavy users who like reviewers know how
to handle potentially problematic extensions can access them and their
comments can help the review process by pointing out problems or reinforcing
reviewer assessments of extension quality.

This enhancement is in line with the general principle that the site should
guide users towards high quality extensions rather than forbidding them from
accessing low/unknown quality ones.  Of course that doesn't mean we should make
every extension accessible to everyone: known malicious extensions should be
removed and users should have to explicitly request low/unknown quality extensions.

But review is just a small part of the process of determining the quality of an
extension.  User comments developer/brand reputation signatures and other
factors all play a role.  And review resources are constrained and are likely to
remain so.

Letting saavy users access and comment on extensions before review has been
completed will improve the experience for those users who want early access to
extensions and are willing/able to cope with problems help reviewers with their
work and provide better faster information about the quality of extensions to
non-saavy users.",nobody,myk,fixed,1,resolved,4,2016-02-04,0,11,2007-02-21,636,normal,2

By interfering the unload process of a XUL page with a modal dialog it is
possible to run javascript code in the context of another domain. This could be
used to steal cookies etc.

page...');location='http://www.google.com';alert('...wait till the new page
loads...');eval('alert(document.location+\'\\n\'+document.cookie);'); >


This demo is not working when tested with similar HTML code. For some reason the
destruction of XUL pages seems to have a different timing.

The test relies on user interaction but there is no way to stop the script when
started (because you can only click ok in an alert box). Well you could kill
the browser process before the target page gets loaded.

CORE-30753,2000-03-06,XPCOM,CORE,typelib loading improvements for time and space performance,"We are still using our original simple-minded scheme of loading all interface 
infos (II) from all typelibs at startup. As things have evolved this is now a 
performance hit in terms of both time and especially space. I have some numbers 
and a plan...

The numbers below are from just starting up the browser and navigating to a page 
and then shutting down. Note that the info about typelib file loading would not 
be effected by use of other parts of the product but the numbers on which IIs 
are actually used would change some if we say used some of the mail/new 
features in this test run.

I wrote a very simple arena suballocator for libxpt that can be turned on for 
decoding only. It is not currently part of the build. There are some obvious 
things that can be made to improve its use of space. But the stats gathered 
from it are of real interest (since they reflect the memory usage of the current 
builds):

()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()
Start xpt memory use stats

14779 times arena malloc called
305343 total bytes requested from arena malloc

30 average bytes used per call to arena malloc

38824 during loading total bytes requested to free
50440 during loading total bytes not freed

14771 total times arena free called
331184 total bytes requested to free
449352 total bytes not freed

2 total times arena realloc called to shrink

8 total times arena realloc called to grow
144 total bytes not freed in realloc grow

460800 total bytes arena requested from system

End xpt memory use stats
()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()

Timewise the fact that malloc is called 14779 times is significant. Spacewise 
305k is being requested and 50k is being released. Since the blocks are on 
average small the spacewise heap overhead matters a lot. We are using upwards of 
1/2 a meg to hold II structs in libxpt!

I then instrumented nsInterfaceInfoManager to get some stats on our actual usage 
of the II structs that are loaded...

END interface info stats


In the first table above we see that less than 10% of the loaded IIs were 
actually used (without running mail/new etc.) Note that the usage counts are 
based on how many times nsInterfaceInfoManager (IIM) was asked for this data. 
The clients of IIM do their own caching.

The second table shows that only about a 25% of the typelib files loaded were 
accessed at all.

The third table shows we accessed only about 20% of the interfaces of each 
typelib that had *any* interfaces accessed. This is becuase we currently use 
xpt_link to link the typelibs in each idl directory.

Also Purify shows me that using my simple arena code made loading the same full 
set of typelibs take only 25% of the time used without the arena code (on NT 
optimized).

We have other data that shows that searching for and loading many .xpt files at 
startup is using too much time. For beta1 it was decided to use xpt_link at 
package time to build a big .xpt file. This way we spend less time finding .xpt 
files and doing file i/o to open/read/close them. (see bug 28964)

All of the above leads me to believe that the best approach is a combination of:

1) Stop using xpt_link in the building of the .idl directories. Instead export 
all .xpt files to dist.

2) Use information from this runtime instrumentation to build a a manifest of 
.xpt files that we use. This will be based on some set of 'normal' application 
activities. This manifest will be used to drive xpt_link and build a big .xpt 
file.

3) Add support to use the zipfile support in libjar for loading .xpt files out 
of .zip files.

4) Zip up all the .xpt files *not* merged in item '2'. This allows us to deliver 
one or a few large .xpt files with the most used IIs and one or a few .zip files 
with all the rest of the IIs. A driving factor here is that the typelib format 
uses a data pool scheme and thus when reading *any* IIs from a typelib it is 
probably best to read them all. So the commonly used IIs will go in big linked 
.xpt files (and be read all together) and the less used ones will go in .zip 
files as separate subfiles that can be individualy extracted into memeory and 
converted by libxpt. (Measuring performance of reading from zipfiles to 
check the viability of this part of the plan comes next).

5) The other big piece is that we need to extend libxpt so that it can extract 
the interface table without reading everything in the file. The interaction 
would be: a) IIM asks libxpt how many bytes to read from a file to read just the 
header. b) IIM reads in a file's header and hands that to libxpt. c) libxpt 
figures out from the header info how many bytes need to be read in order to read 
the interface table and responds with that number to IIM. d) IIM reads in those 
bytes from the file and gives them to libxpt with builds the in memory interface 
table.

6) Given item '5' then we can get rid of the requirement to read in .xpt files 
each and every time we start the app. Instead we can build a manifest table of 
(iface_name uuid zip_file_name file_name) records *only* at autoreg time. 
Just like with DLLs we will require that in order for the system to know about 
new II files (.xpt and .zip) it will have to be told to do autoreg. We 
connect this to the same DLL autoreg system. So only at autoreg time do we 
build the manififest of mappings of IIs to files. We can store this in a file in 
the file system or in the registry. We load that menifest at each startup. The 
IIM then builds a small in memory record of each interface without touching any 
typelib files. This allows us to enumerate the interfaces etc. It lazily loads 
any interface for which the info that we need from the typelibs is requested. If 
we read one II from a file then we read all IIs from that file. So the commonly 
used IIs will be gang loaded from the big .xpt file(s). The rarely used 
IIs will be grabbed from the .zip file(s) as needed. Typelibs for extensions 
(etc.) can be dropped into the components directory (or elsewhere if we support 
that) as .xpt or .zip files and autoreg forced. Note that we might want to use 
some other file extension instead of zip; e.g xar or something.

7) The above will save hugly on space and time. We can then decide whether or 
not to use the arena suballocator scheme. It's weaknesses are that it can't 
release any memory it needs to align memory and it needs to track block size 
to support realloc. With some tuning in libxpt I think that the wasted 
non-released memory might be smaller. The XPT_Malloc calls could specify 
alignment requirements to avoid byte waste. And we might be able to segregate 
the very few allocs that require later reallocs so that arena alloc'd blocks 
need not carry size info. So with just a little work we may save a bunch more 
memory here by tightly packing these blocks.
 
I think that we can implement the above without a huge amount of work and that 
it all constitutes a reasonable tradeoff a huge will in footprint.",jband_mozilla,jband_mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,9,2001-02-05,336,normal,2

NSPR-30914,2000-03-07,NSPR,NSPR,PR_PushIOLayer should not swap the contents of the fd's,"When we push a fd onto the top of a fd stack
the current implementation of PR_PushIOLayer
swaps the contents of the new fd and the fd at
the top of the stack so that the address of
the top of the stack won't change. (PR_PopIOLayer
switches the contents back if the top of a stack
is popped.)  While this fd swapping is not obvious
things do work correctly if you push and pop the
fd's in the right order.

However this fd swapping is problematic if you
pass a pointer to a fd to some callback function
and then push some other fd on top of that fd.
The pointer you passed to the callback function
will be pointing to the contents of the new
fd.  We ran into this problem in our Mac socket
I/O code where we pass a pointer to a fd to OpenTransport
notifier routines.

We can avoid the fd content swapping by adding a dummy
top fd and always push new fd's underneath the
dummy top fd.  Then the address of the top of the stack
will also remain unchanged after pushing and popping.

Since this change will break backward compatibility
it can only be considered for NSPR 5.0.",srinivas,wtc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2000-04-06,0,7,2000-03-21,14,normal,2

a regression that has happened between 20050917 and 20050918 causes firefox and thunderbird to print blank pages.
preview works fine the print job is sent to printer but the page comes out blank.
this is still valid for latest firefox/thunderbird nightly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. send a page to printer.
Actual Results:  
blank page comes out of the printer


as i said i pinned down the regression to the update from 20050917 to 20050918.
20050917 prints the page content 20050918 prints blank pages.
btw the page count is correct - if you print more than one page the right number of blank pages come out.

Hi Tony

Gotta a question concerning Eudora import/export and Messenger. I imported my
Inbox from Messenger into Eudora. Then I imported from Eudora to Messanger. The
original messages were composed in HTML. But when I imported them back from
Eudora they were basically text files containing HTML code/tags.

Can we make Netscape's IMPORT feature convert it back into real HTML messages?

Also when I do a reply the mail compose window comes up in HTML mode so I
don't understand why these messages are not in HTML. Is this a limitation of
Eudora?

I just created a Saved Search for finding messages larger than 1M.

The bug (if it deems such a grand title) is that the options is greater/less than doesn't mention what the units are - which are actually KBytes. I just think that fact should be added - otherwise people like me think it's bytes and wonder why we found no messages larger than 1000000 ;-)

NSPR-32184,2000-03-16,NSPR,NSPR,PL_HashTableEnumerateEntries isn't stable over PL_HashTableRawLookup,"If a client of PLHashTable calls PL_HashTableEnumerateEntries() and the 
PLHashEnumerator function calls PL_HashTableRawLookup() then not all of the 
entries in the PLHashTable will be successfully visited. The reason is that 
PL_HashTableRawLookup() splays the hash bucket chains to provide MRU caching.

Does this qualify as a bug in PL_HashTableEnumerateEntries() or is this a bug in 
our usage of it? This was discovered to cause PLHashEntry leaks when using 
PL_HashTableEnumerateEntries() to delete all of the entries of XPCOM's service 
hashtable.

A possible fix for this problem would be to add state to PLHashTable to indicate 
that an enumeration is taking place in order to inhibit the splaying behavior. 
Here's a patch that I've written that corrects the problem:

I finally had a look at the first version of that patch and the discussion there and realized the steps to reproduce which are something I do reasonably often:
 1. switch tabs using Ctrl-PgUp or Ctrl-PgDn
 2. really quickly before the switch happens switch virtual desktops using
    Ctrl-Arrow (that may be a shortcut I configured rather than the default
    GNOME one)
It's pretty easy for me to do this fast enough that I'm on a different virtual desktop before the tab switch happens.

I really don't like the look of the patch in bug 295447 for two reasons:
 * focus is already overloaded enough; if we need a method to do a raise/present it should be a separate method.  That the DOM 0 backwards compatibility requires that window.focus() do a raise/present in some cases is IMO a quirk that should not be propagated all the way down into the widget code.  If the DOM code requires a raise/present it should do that on its own.
 * we shouldn't do a raise/present when switching tabs.
Why do we want that patch -- why should it not be backed out?

linux specific. However I can also reproduce this crash on win98 and it

Note that I can't reproduce the crash when the  is used in an
HTML page (or at least I can't emulate the same constraints). 

---------------
Overview Description:
  Crash for certain widget events in Preferences panels  

Steps to Reproduce:

1) start mozilla

2) Open Edit->Preferences and go to the Appearance->Fonts panel

3) open the  for Fonts for: ...

4) hit down-arrow ( closes and focus moves to Navigator 
   in the left-hand Category panel

5) hit up-arrow to reselect Appearance->Fonts

6) click to open the same  as before

7) crash

Actual Results: crash

Expected Results: open the  again

Reproducibility: always

Build Date & Platform Bug Found:
  2000032309 trunk commercial build on linux (rh6.1)

Additional Builds and Platforms Tested On:
 also crashes on 2000032309 trunk commercial build on win98 

 does not crash on 2000032309 trunk commercial build on mac (the 
 widget behaviour is different so I can't get mozilla into the same
 situation -- down-arrow does not move focus to the Navigator
 item in the Category panel)

hi norris

Test case for a JavaScript Bug:

The JS engine failed with the following piece of code:

    alert(inside js file);

    anArray[0] = 5;
    anArray[1] = 6;

    ++anArray[--pos];
    alert(anArray[pos]);

The above script works fine within netscape but it throws the following

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060415 Thunderbird/3.0a1 ID:2006041500

If I mark a bigger block of text at least more than one page in the editor with the cursor (arrow down / page down) and like to 'unmark' some lines with the cursor (arrow up / page up) the cursor does not scroll upwards but remains at the last line of the editor window and the text scrolls through. This makes reading and finding the right position quite annoying. 
This behaviour cannot be seen in actual branch nightlies and was also not seen in: 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060414 Thunderbird/3.0a1 ID:2006041308.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a text into the editor window which is longer than the window
2. Mark part of the text (arrow down / page down) so that the marked area is longer than the window
3. Scroll upwards (arrow up / page up) to unmark a smaller passage of the text
Actual Results:  
The cursor remains at the bottom of the editor window and the text scrolls through behind. 

Expected Results:  
The cursor should scroll upwards until it reaches the top of the editor window.

If you encounter a bug with Mozilla please take the time to file a report in <a

not all have time to follow all the Mozilla-related forums on a regular basis
and if you just post a bug report to a newsgroup or mailing list then it may not
reach anyone who can actually do anything about the bug. By reporting the bug
through Bugzilla you ensure that it will receive a higher level of attention
and will be tracked along with other bugs. See the <a
href=http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html>bug writing
guidelines for information on how to submit high-quality bug reports. Also
note that you can use Bugzilla to report problems with the mozilla.org servers

Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.5.0.2 FR downloaded from http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=thunderbird-1.5.0.2&os=win&lang=fr

When TB sends a return receipt in French it sends non-ASCII characters in the subject header.

When the recipient of the return receipt has configured amavisd-new to reject bad headers I get error messages such as :

INVALID HEADER (INVALID CHARACTERS OR SPACE GAP)
Non-encoded 8-bit data (char E9 hex) in message header 'Subject': Subject: Accus\351 de r\351ception (...

and the recipient doesn't get the return receipt.

The problem comes from some localized messages are using non-ASCII characters .
For example :
MdnDisplayedReceipt=Accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception (affich\00e0)

These messages should be encoded by TB (RFC 2047).
Same problem for the following messages :
MdnDispatchedReceiptMdnProcessedReceiptMdnDeletedReceiptMdnDeniedReceiptMdnFailedReceipt.

This problem certainly occurs for several other languages.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a french version of Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
2. Send a message to Thunderbird from another place asking for a return receipt
3. When the message arrives accept to send the return receipt
4. At the other place look at the headers of the return receipt message sent by Thunderbird

Actual Results:  
The header of the return receipt contains :
Subject: Accusé de réception (affiché) -  Essai AR jcr



Expected Results:  
The header od the return should contain someting like :

i'd like it backed out but i'll request that in the other bug.

this bug should work on localizing it properly which is with a show_bug and similar oriented filter instead of corrupting the data that gets serialized in the database.

steps to reproduce:

1. setup a tip bugzilla with two languages: en-US es-AR.
2. file bug 1
3. file bug 2
4. as an es-AR user resolve bug 2 as a duplicate of bug 1
5. as a localizer change the es-AR string for resolve as duplicate
6. as admin update your localization
7. file bug 3
8. file bug 4
9. as an es-AR user resolve bug 3 as a duplicate of bug 2
10. as an en-US user resolve bug 4 as a duplicate of bug 1
11. upgrade bugzilla to a version which doesn't support es-AR
12. log into bugzilla as an en-US user and read bug 1.

Calling env->FindClass() then loads the class using the class loader of the class that called the native method.

However in the case of native callbacks or nsJavaXPTCStub (which is a native Proxy for a Java object) simply calling env->FindClass() doesn't always work.  In this case since the JNIEnv* doesn't come from a Java method FindClass() defaults to the main class loader (usually the System class loader) in order to load classes.  This works for the most part but sometimes fails.

The correct way to do this is to get the class loader of the Java object represented by the nsJavaXPTCStub object and load any classes based on that class loader.",jhpedemonte,jhpedemonte,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-09-24,1,9,2006-09-28,7,normal,2

Feel free to set the milestone to M30.
-----------

Subject: Just A Mozilla Suggestion
Date: Sat 08 Apr 2000 02:49:21 -0500
From: Ryan McGann 
To: Waqar Malik 

While looking at the Mozilla sources I just thought you guys may be
interested in this...take it at face valueÐa suggestion from a guy.

When looking at void nsWindow::ScrollBits(...) (line 1253) there is the
comment:

// ::ScrollRect() unfortunately paints the invalidated area with the
// background pattern. This causes lots of ugly flashing and makes us look
// pretty bad. Instead we roll our own ::ScrollRect() by using ::CopyBits()
// to scroll the image in the view and then set the update
// rgn appropriately so that the compositor can blit it to the screen.

While I admit I don't totally understand your home-brewed solution under
Carbon 1.02 there are the following APIs:
   ScrollWindowRect
   ScrollWindowRegion
which allow you to pass an options flag constant which (among other things)
can do one of three things with the scrolled region: (a) nothing (b)
invalidate or (c) erase the scrolled region to the background pattern or
color (which you DON'T want). So by passing only constant (b) to
ScrollWindowRectyou can achieve the same effect with less code and slightly
faster scrolling results and MUCH faster scrolling under Mac OS X (compared
to using my solution to the same problemÐusing a QDProc that intercepts
fillVerb and does nothing during CopyBits). Since your solution currently
isn't Carbon-savvy anyway I'd suggest at least taking a look at this code.
By using the named  APIs you'll save yourself a LOT of code it looks like.",mikepinkerton,pierre,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-07-18,0,9,2001-07-18,463,normal,2

I will once more explain the problem. A test program that only uses libjs and 
nspr4 is attached.

Setup

1) Two JSScipts containing the following scripts:
Script1:

function X() 
{}
function a()
{
  x.__debug__() ;
}
X.prototype.doIt=a ;

Script2:
var l = new X() ;
a();
l.doIt() ;
x.__debug__() ;

2) a runtime and a compile context are created
3) a compile global is created
3) scripts are compiled (against the compile global in the compile context)
4) two threads are created (each with own execution global(linked via prototype 
chain to the compile global) and with own execution context
Also a global host object x is introduced with private data. The pointer to 
the private data can be displayed with .__debug__().
5) run the two scripts SLICED in a loop. This means that after the script1 of 
the first thread the script1 of the second thread is run and then the script2 
of the first thread is run and then the script2 of the second thread. Do this a 
couple of times.

The output shows the following:

HWJS_Server::server_debug() 0x807c860
HWJS_Server::server_debug() 0x807c860
HWJS_Server::server_debug() 0x807c860

The problem seems to be that refresh calls adjustRangeValues which will end up trying to do stuff with the slider's value and end up trying to set the slider's value property with an invalid value which will call eraseSlider with an invalid value.  This will get passed to Canvas's clearRect method which generates the error in the error console.

The call to erase slider is protected by isNaN(value) but it doesn't make any test for isNaN(this.value) which is what is passed to eraseSlider.  That is probably the bug.

FIREFOX_GRAVEYARD-368252,2007-01-25,Microsummaries,FIREFOX_GRAVEYARD,notify observers when a microsummary gets updated,"In order to better enable extensions (and core code) to extend microsummary functionality it would be useful to broadcast a notification (via the observer service most likely) when a live title gets updated so that extensions can do additional work at that point.

For example an extension could use this to flash the live title or otherwise (f.e. using growl) bring the update to the attention of the user.

And an extension that allows users to specify refresh intervals for individual live titles might then modify the live title's expiration time from the default assigned by the microsummary service.

One question is whether it would make sense to additionally notify observers before initiating the update request (and giving them the opportunity to cancel or otherwise modify it) i.e. something like a microsummary-before-update notification in addition to a microsummary-after-update one.

Another issue is what to pass in the aSubject and someData parameters to nsIObserverService::notifyObservers.  Currently an nsIMicrosummary has no knowledge about the live title it's being used for (if any).  So just passing it as the value of the aSubject parameter doesn't give the observer enough information.

We could additionally pass the bookmark ID as the value of someData but that seems clunky.  Seems like we're going to have to either make nsIMicrosummary smarter about what it's being used for (bookmark label page tab label etc.) or pass some other object referencing both the nsIMicrosummary and the thing using it (nsIMicrosummaryConsumer?).

CORE_GRAVEYARD-37370,2000-04-27,Cmd-line Features,CORE_GRAVEYARD,Switch command-line-handler to use category manager instead of a ProgID naming scheme.,"Currently a command-line-argument-handler component needs to have a specific
ProgID for the command-line handler to be able to find it.

The jsconsole command-line-argument-handler for example _has_ to be named
'component://netscape/commandlinehandler/general-startup-jsconsole'. See bug
#37275 for more info on why this is now regarded as wrong.

Instead a command-line-argument0handler needs to register itself with the
category manager. JS example:

  var catman = Components.classes['mozilla.categorymanager.1']
      .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICategoryManager);
  catman.addCategoryEntry('command-line-argument-handlers' 'jsconsole'
      JSCONSOLESERVICE_PROGID true true);

Where JSCONSOLESERVICE_PROGID can be any string but preferably conforming to
the new naming scheme. I choose 'org.mozilla.general-startup.jsconsole.1' for
now.

TOOLKIT-375332,2007-03-25,Application Update,TOOLKIT,patcher2 changes required to support beta program,"In the 2.0.0.3 release we revived the beta program so that we released 2.0.0.3 rc1 builds on the beta aus channel for testers to get early access to.

To get this to work I ended up:

-- Doing the standard patcher2 run for a release (which is in the automation).
-- Change the beta-url in the patcher2.cfg so that it pointed to ftp.m.o not bouncer (because bouncer links weren't configured yet)
-- Change the version in the patcher2.cfg to be 2.0.0.3rc1; you can do this inside the -block (leaving 2.0.0.3 the same)
-- Re-run patcher2 with --create-patchinfo
-- rsync aus2 to aus2.beta
-- run find -depth -type d -iregex '.*beta.*' -exec rm -rfv {} \;

At the end you have an aus2.beta directory that will present snippets that have rc1 in the user UI and will only be available to people on the beta channel.

So it'd be nice if patcher2 supported this process by itself; some other things it'd have to support:

-- respin support (so sending complete updates to those on the beta channel so they get the latest rc)
-- configurable channel-specific aus2 directories (so aus2 aus2.test aus2.beta etc.)",mozpreed,mozpreed,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,13,2007-05-02,38,major,4

CORE-37651,2000-04-30,MathML,CORE,X font aliasing destroys MathML rendering,"Font aliasing can completely destroy Mozilla's math rendering.

On my Linux system I have the standard Adobe symbol fonts which have xlfd
names of the form
-adobe-symbol-medium-r-normal--*-*-*-*-p-*-adobe-fontspecific. I also have a
truetype symbol font which has the xlfd name
-monotype-symbol-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-microsoft-symbol. In addition I
have the type1 AMS math AMS CM and Mathematica math fonts installed.

With just a standard system with just the normal fonts.alias files Mozilla
loads the test page reasonably well. There are a few places where it can't
find a glyph but mostly it works. An important point is that it never uses the
truetype font presumably because it doesn't know what microsoft-symbol means.

Now let's say I've been trying to display some sort of HTML math for a while
so sometime in the past I went to
http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/Xfonts.html and used the aliasing method
described there. Mozilla's rendering falls completely apart blank space
question marks little boxes. All sorts of bad things.

Now let's remove those aliases that cause all the trouble and instead create
the alias -monotype-symbol-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-8 for the
truetype symbol font. Mozilla's rendering again falls apart but in a different
way.

In all the cases Mozilla appears to be hunting for glyphs. It opens all sorts
of fonts. In both the aliasing cases Mozilla opens even more fonts so it's
looking for something. The last case is particularly interesting because
iso8859-8 should be completely irrelevant.

Part of the problem seems to be Mozilla's aggressive font substitution
policies. It appears that it looks for glyphs even if it doesn't need to.

Another part of the problem may be that the test page's CSS files lump the
cmsy10 cmex10 symbol and times fonts into one family even though that's
clearly not true.

The bottom line here is that Mozilla is easily confused. Font aliasing is a
standard technique so Mozilla will just have to be smarter about what it does.
It will be hard though.",rbs,tenthumbs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-12-20,0,13,2001-12-20,599,normal,2

simple fix is described here - it's just a CSS problem.

2) on lines 30 and 31 change

This bug really only affects drawing things that span that entire coordinate space after transformations; you can draw on a virtual area of any size as long as you translate the visible portion to the screen first.  However if you are drawing any large objects that's where you can run into problems

This bug is a collection point for all other bugs that are affected by this issue.  Right now I have a fix that changes cairo's fixed point precision to be 24.8; however currently pixman remains at 16.16 so if the native platform can't handle the operation we'll still have 16.16 issues.  Under linux 16.16 is part of the X Render API so we won't be able to fix anything there.  Under OSX we should never hit fallback so we should get the full 24.8 precision when talking to Quartz.  On Win32 for some common things (e.g. clearing large background rectangles) we won't hit fallback; for other things we can hope that the CTM will translate things into the visible range.",vladimir,vladimir,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-11-02,0,7,2007-10-09,115,normal,2

This may wind up being a duplicate of bug #30750 but not sure so will log
separately.  Not sure who this'll belong to...

When changing an IMAP account server settings for delete model from MoveToTrash
to Remove Immediately the account's existing Trash folder should have it's
special folder status removed and sort to the regular folder hierarchy.  This
is not currently happening.  (I'm comparing to 4.x behavior.)

1.  Login to an IMAP account which has its server setting for delete as Move to
Trash.  In this state the account should have a Trash folder sorted in with the
special folders at the top of the folder hierarchy.
2.  Edit the account settings to change the delete mode to Remove Immediately.
Confirm OK to the change and confirm out of account settings dialog.
3.  Note the trash folder is still present in the special folders portion of the
hierarchy and still carries its trashcan icon.
4.  Exit and relaunch login to same account.  Note the trash is still in the
special folders section.

Actual result:  no visual indication that the trash is no longer a special
folder.

Expected result:  (again I'm using 4.x behavior as my basis) Upon confirmation
of the pref change that account's trash folder should lose special folder
status; it should lose trash folder icon and be sorted in with the regular user
folder portion of the account's folder hierarchy.",mkmelin+mozilla,laurel,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-09-15,1,33,2011-11-26,4215,trivial,1

  New bookmarks (sometimes others but at least the new ones) won't delete when you try to delete them using the context menu 
in the Manage Bookmarks window. They seem to delete fine with the mene and by using context menus in the sidebar.

***Steps to Reproduce: 
There are more ways to repro this bug but this seems to work all the time.

1) Select Bookmarks|Add Current page

2) Select Bookmarks| Manage Bookmarks.

3) Select your bookmark and then right-click on it.

4) Choose delete bookmark from the resultant context menu.

5) Click 'OK' in the confirm delete dialog that pops up.



***Actual Results: 

The confirm delete dialog pops up but clicking OK has no result (dialog dismisses). The bookmark is still there.

***Expected Results: 

Bookmark should be instanly removed (deleted)

***Build Date & Platform Bug Found: 

Discovered on Win2k and repro'd on Win98 and Linux RH6 with 2000051210 builds

  * Address 0x7fffa5b0 is 16 bytes above stack pointer in function

The problem is due to the fact that ParseRFC1485Name calls
        SEC_CreateName(SECRDN *rdn0 ...)
using
        SEC_CreateName(NULL).

SEC_CreateName doesn't quite handle the case that the first arg
is null properly.  That is it still goes into the va_args loop on
it.  Because of the way gcc does va_args in this case nothing past the
first null is really initialized.  The code gets lucky generally
and the next position is zero.  One could argue this is a gcc bug
but we should avoid it.

Here is a fixed SEC_CreateName().  You will also find this in
certsvc_dev_branch until it hits mainline.

SECName *
SEC_CreateName(SECRDN *rdn0 ...)
{
    SECRDN *rdn;
    SECName *name;

    unsigned count;

    DSArena *arena;
    
    arena = DS_NewArena(DER_DEFAULT_CHUNKSIZE);
    if ( !arena ) {
        return(0);
    }
    
    name = (SECName*) DS_ArenaAlloc(arena sizeof(SECName));
    if (name) {
        name->arena = arena;
        
        /* Count number of RDNs going into the Name */
        count = 0;
        if (rdn0 != NULL) {
            va_start(ap rdn0);
            count = 1;
            while ((rdn = va_arg(ap SECRDN*)) != 0) {
                count++;

rewritten for NSS 3.0 so I'm assigning to fred to close when NSS 3.0 comes in.

======================

Summary by roeber: sure this code will all be replaced when we go to the new
APIs (now slated for NSS 4.0) but at this rate who knows when that'll happen. 
Until (and unless) that happens this bug is still legit: the code for
SEC_CreateName though superficially changed (look for CERT_CreateName now) is
still substantially the same and has the same problem.",nelson,bugzilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2000-09-28,0,4,2000-09-28,135,normal,2

parser filter from reading the implementation it looks like it's meant to
return a weak reference to the old parser filter ie no reference held by either
the parser nor the caller the gets the old filter. The way it's implemented the
parser releses the old filter with NS_RELEASE(old) then it does a return old;.
The result of this is that it always returns null so nothing bad will ever
happen as a result of calling nsParser::SetParserFilter() but if a unrefcounted
pointer to the old parser filter would actually be returned the pointer could be
pointing to a deleted object since the parser doesn't know if calling release on
the old filter actually deletes the old filter or just decrements its
refcount...

wrong (TM).

NSPR-40778,2000-05-26,NSPR,NSPR,Support for layered nonblocking connect,"NSPR doesn't support layered nonblocking
connect if the layer needs to do additional
socket I/O (such as talking to a SOCKS
server) after the network connection is
established.

The current procedure of doing nonblocking
connect in NSPR is the following three steps:
    PR_Connect
    PR_Poll
    PR_GetConnectStatus
(The reason we cannot retry PR_Connect
after PR_Poll is that it may raise
SIGPIPE on some System V Unix variants
if the nonblocking connect fails.) The
assumption is that the outcome of the
nonblocking connect should be known
when PR_Poll returns.  This assumption
is not true for layered nonblocking
connect that requires a sequence like
this:
    PR_Connect
    PR_Poll
    network connection is established
    do some more socket i/o
    PR_Poll
    do some more socket i/o
    .
    .
    .
    PR_Poll
    do some more socket i/o
    done

We need a new NSPR I/O method in which
a layer can do the additional socket i/o
during the nonblocking connect process.
Suppose this new function is called
PR_ConnectContinue.  Then the nonblocking
connect procedure would look like:
    PR_Connect
    do {
        PR_Poll
        rv = PR_ConnectContinue
    } while (rv == PR_IN_PROGRESS_ERROR)

(I was tempted to just convert the existing
PR_GetConnectStatus into an I/O method but
this would break binary compatibility.  Sigh.)",wtc,wtc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-05-05,0,14,2000-09-07,104,normal,2

Build Identifier: trunk

Under the Fonts & Encodings tab an option named Apply default character encoding to all incoming messages exists. Not sure what it was originally supposed to workaround but this option seems to cause Thunderbird to ignore all valid RFC-compliant MIME headers and blindly display all messages in selected encoding.

This option was probably useful in early days when MIME support was sparse and users have used non-ASCII charsets without properly declaring them in MIME headers. However today MIME adoption is almost universal - and this option is
actually causing serious RFC breakage and encoding problems. Many users don't fully understand what this option is actually doing and check it in an effort
to fix wrong encoding on single email - then run into much severe trouble since proper MIME headers are with this option ignored for all valid cases.

Thus this option is nowadays doing serious harm to the email system and needs to be completely discontinued.

everything else
nsParser (if you leak the parser you leak *everything*)
SheetLoadData
nsStreamLoader

InterceptStreamListener

The leak occurred in nsCachedNetData::InterceptAsyncRead because
interceptListener->Init returned null and therefore the functioned returned
without ever addrefing or releasing interceptListener which caused
interceptListener (an InterceptStreamListener) to leak.  I will attach the fix
in a minute.

However this raises some slightly more important questions:
 * why does Init() fail causing the leak?
 * does the ownership model really need to make a small leak turn into something

Animated GIFs aren't cached by imagelib which causes us to end up fetching them 
again with necko. This ends up reading the file from disk because the file: 
protocol doesn't cache in the memory cache either. This also causes contention 
for the file transport consumes inordinate amounts of memory takes a lot of 
time etc.

Clearly the throbber images should get cached somewhere ideally by imagelib in 
their decoded state. We should extend the imagelib APIs to allow us to specify 
when an animated gif should be cached",pavlov,warrensomebody,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-03-30,1,36,2001-03-30,302,normal,2

Cache main threads pet thread data.

About 33% of the time we spend in the XPCCallContext constructor (which is called a *lot*) is spent getting to the per thread data (XPCPerThreadData::GetData()). This can be cached for the main thread so we don't always need to do the expensive lookup of the per thread data. The key to this is to use cx->thread (or the JS engines thread id which would also work but takes more time to get to) to tell whether we're called on the main thread or not and if we're not then we leave the cache alone and do the lookup the expensive way.

CORE-412833,2008-01-17,Security: PSM,CORE,TLS intolerant server condition is concluded prematurely,"When an attempt to connect to a server using a TLS client hello fails 
PSM marks the server as TLS intolerant which causes all future handshake
attempts to use an alternative fall back handshake (currently an SSL v3
handshake in SSLv2 compatible format).  PSM decides that all future 
handshake attempts will use the alternative handshake EVEN IF the 
alternative handshake never succeeds.  

Consequently if the user is trying to visit a server that (say) only 
understands TLS client hellos and does not understand the alternative 
fall back handshake and the user is unlucky enough that the first TLS 
handshake attempt fails the user must restart the browser to get it to 
ever try a TLS handshake again.

I can imagine these solutions to this problem:

1) Have a way to try an alternative handshake once and don't mark the 
server as always requiring the alternative handshake until an alternative
handshake succeeds.  Kai points out that this requires changes to the 
code path for successful handshakes as well as in the error paths.

2) Toggle the TLS intolerant flag on every failure.  That is if an 
attempt to connect with TLS fails set the TLS intolerant flag and retry.  
If an attempt to connect with SSL3 fails clear the TLS intolerant flag
and retry.  Limit the number of retries to 1 (may be difficult).

3) Like 2 but if an attempt to connect with SSL3 fails clear the TLS
intolerant flag but do not immediately retry.  This solves the issue 
with limiting the number of retries I think.",honzab.moz,nelson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2010-04-19,1,6,2009-07-21,551,normal,2

There are two problems that I can spot in this code:

1. This seems to get called from a background thread and not the main thread.  Bug 326491 changed nsObserverService to only accept observers from the main thread (see bug 326491 comment 9 for more info).  This comment mentions using an XPCOM proxy to work with nsObserverService from background threads but I'm not sure how to do that.  Check the code: 

2. Specifying true as the third param of nsIObserverService::AddObserver() will only succeed when the component is capable of providing an nsIWeakReference which does not seem to be the case with the cert override service.  So the last param should be changed to PR_FALSE.

I observed this problem while working on bug 248970 and trying to add a new observer to this component which failed for no apparent reason.

FIREFOX-415497,2008-02-03,Theme,FIREFOX,Put the back button on the window edge to make it an easier target,"Created attachment 301200
Proof of concept

Quoth Wikipedia on Fitts' Law:

Edges (e.g. the menubar in Mac OS) and corners of the computer display (e.g. Start button in Windows XP) are particularly easy to acquire because the pointer remains at the screen edge regardless of how much further the mouse is moved thus can be considered as having infinite width.

When the window is maximized the back button is 1 or 2 pixels from a position where the cursor on the edge of the screen can target it. The back button is a very common target so I think it would help improve our goal of Flow if we put the back button on the very edge of the window this giving it infinite width and making it an easier target.

The keyhole might make this impossible on other platforms but we're using a native-ish interface on Linux. We did this for the scrollbar so we should do this for the back button.

directories I have viewed.  When I am in /home it still lists /home/jwb /home

so that picking a path makes the dialog jump to that directory.

Third the .. button keeps adding paths to the list even after I have reached

 Bugzilla sent a URL of length 10930 bytes to Apache which caused
 Apache to choke. 

Steps to Reproduce:
 -- Well don't bother reproducing it but what I did was ...

1) I was changing the Product for a bug while adding comments etc.
   which then sent me to the page for selecting component/milestone/version. 

2) This is done by using GET's to maintain the state across the pages
   (i.e. encoding state in the URL).

3) I was also adding a couple of stack traces inline with my other
   comments and changes.

Actual Results:
  Apache returned an error for 'URI too long' (not an exact quote)

Expected Results:
  Successfully complete the update (although I don't really expect
  this given the situation)

Reproducibility: well in this case always but it's a special case.

Additional Information:

You can resolve this as wontfix if you like. I realize that avoiding 
this limit would mean some significant changes to Bugzilla. If anything
probably better to just detect this situation before it happens and 
give a more graceful message to the end user.

CORE-43121,2000-06-19,XUL,CORE,pull XUL content model out of rdf.dll,"An issue that has been coming up more frequently with respect to
embedding has been proper factoring of our DLLs. A couple of us were
talking today and came up with some ideas to better factor one of our
largest offenders librdf.so.


Summary

I'd like to take the contents of rdf/content/src and move them to
layout/xul/content/src layout/xul/content/document and dom.

I'll be breaking things along the same lines that HTML and XML content
do (./document gets content sink and document files; ./content gets
content node files; ./dom gets vidur-IDL and stubs).

Some of the files that move to DOM will live there only until hyatt and
ben can get rid of the JS glue replacing it with its XBL equivalents;
others will become permanent residents (nsJSXULElement.cpp and
nsJSXULDocument.cpp for example). These could theoretically be
controlled by #ifdef INCLUDE_XUL.

The files that move to layout/xul will be built into a standalone DLL
libxul.so which will have no link-time dependencies on anything else in
the layout directory.


Background

librdf.so is a 1Mb DLL (optimized Linux) that holds both the XUL
content model (about 80% of its bulk) and some miscellany used to parse
RDF/XML and maintain in-memory datasources.

libchrome.so is a 150Kb DLL that uses librdf.so to properly indirect
chrome: URLs.

Necko Gecko and others are pull libchrome.so and librdf.so into their
dependency graph primarily because of reliance on chrome: URLs (e.g.
to load string bundles to provide skin-switching capabilites for XUL). 

  - The chrome registry is an RDF/XML file which stores the
    indirection information

  - The chrome registry is used to provide propery indirection
    to the currently selected locale.

To date no embedders require this functionality.

Strictly speaking XUL can run *without* RDF and the chrome registry
with only modifications to the XBL and CSS files it uses. (Replacing
chrome: URLs with resource: URLs for example.)

The XPFE team is currently working to break link-time dependencies on
nsContainerFrame and eventually plan to be able to 


Rationale

Going forward we need to make a decision with respect to embedding. To
include XUL or not to include XUL?

XUL makes many embedding issues extremely straightforward: it provides
dialogs tooltips context menus focus management command updating
and someday may even provide the widget set itself via XBL.

This flexibility currently comes with a fairly large footprint cost: on
Linux the XUL content frames account for 15% of libraptorhtml.so's size
(about 1Mb out of 7Mb) and 80% of librdf.so's size (800Kb out of 1Mb).

While it may make sense in the long run to re-use XUL and XBL within
HTML in the short term having a plan to factor XUL into its own module
seems to make the most sense.

This separates RDF/XML and chrome resolution from core XUL content
reducing XUL content's payload by about 30%; RDF/XML and chrome would
live in their own 200Kb and 150Kb libraries saving a 350Kb code
footprint.


Future

If nsCSSFrameConstructor could dispatch on namespace and with
additional effort to remove the XUL frames' depenency on
nsContainerFrame XUL frames could theoretically live in their own DLL.
This would reduce the core HTML layout engine's size by about 15%.

In theory this would allow Gecko to be embedded without XUL; however
it would require us (well jud and rpotts) to design solutions for at
least the following problems:

  1. maintaining focus state
  2. handling keybindings (e.g. PgUp PgDn)
  3. event propogation to the HTML container
  4. tooltips context menus dialogs ...

(Hyatt can discuss these better; I'm sketching...)

Alternatively XUL and XBL could form the basis for the existing form
controls. Right now the bulk (about 36%) of libraptorhtml.so comes from
the HTML content elements many of which are form controls. Using XBL
many of these could be replaced with JS implementations which have
negligible footprint.

In any case factoring out XUL's content elements and co-locating in the
source tree them with the XUL frames seems to make sense even if the
content nodes continue to live in their own DLL.",waterson,waterson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,13,2001-02-21,247,normal,2

necessary to make TITLE tooltips work perfectly which requires that the

The problem is this: the popup's Layout method calls GetPrefSize which
works its way down to the HTML frames. nsBoxToBlockAdaptor computes the
preferred size by flowing the text into an unconstrained canvas which
puts it all on one line. So the desired size is one very long line. I
have a CSS max-width property that forces the popup frame to be a
reasonable width. So the width is set and we call Layout. This works its
way down the HTML frames find out about the new width and wrap the text.
The increased height is propagated back up to the scroll port in the
popup where it's dropped because the scroll port frame doesn't care how
big its child gets. So the popup never resizes vertically to fit the
wrapped text.",hyatt,roc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-08-13,1,9,2008-08-13,2975,normal,2

Sample steps to reproduce:

1. Go offline
2. Hide message pane (f8)
3. Select and delete an unread imap message

4. Go back online
At this point the offline delete will get played back and the unread trash count will revert to what it was before the whole process. Selecting the trash folder corrects the unread count.

Here's the stack trace where the count reverts back to the wrong value (found by just setting a breakpoint on nsDBFolderInfo::ChangeNumUnreadMessages)

I think we're deleting the ghost header that the offline operation created as a placeholder for the real message that we'll only find out about when we download headers for the trash folder. And since that ghost header is unread we decrement the unread count for the folder. I'm not sure what the fix is. Since we're deleting the ghost header w/o updating the folder it seems like we shouldn't be tweaking the counts at all.",mozilla,mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,5,2008-05-27,5,normal,2

Currently XForms trunk builds on Windows done with MSVC2005 or 2008 build a xforms.dll which depends on msvcr80.dll or msvcr90.dll. This DLL (the c runtime library) is not distributed with official Firefox builds and not available on all target systems either. Mozilla does their Firefox builds using a custom CRT including jemalloc (according to ted on IRC #developers). ted also recommended using USE_STATIC_LIBS=1 for all extensions which statically links the runtime environment into the DLL.
See http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/USE_STATIC_LIBS for details.
Doing that gives us a DLL which works on all supported Windows versions even those where that file is not available.

This was not a problem with 1.8 branch builds as they are done using VS6 and the corresponding runtime library (msvcrt.dll) is available on all supported Windows versions by default.

One of the web sites I use regularly failed to update their SSL certificates. Firefox brought up an error message to advise me of this. It reads:

Secure Connection Failed
www.thefaultywebsite.com uses an invalid security certificate
The certificate expired on 6/7/08 at 07:53

Considering I uses a UK English build of Firefox and it's a site I visit frequently I assume the date above is 6th July 2008. However if I communicate this error to the web site owners who are in the US they may well read this as 7th June 2008. It would help debugging and communication if the date was in a long format that made the date obvious.

* STEPS TO REPRODUCE
0) Launch Internet Explorer 
1) Make it your default browser located in preferences | programs .
2) Quit Internet Explorer. Launch Internet Explorer a second time making it your 
default browser when prompted. 
3) Launch mozilla
4) Open preferences | Advanced | desktop integration 
5) Make mozilla the default application for JPEG images. 
6) Quit mozilla
7) In your Windows explorer make several copies of any JPEG file so that you 
have icons of foo.jfif foo.pjpeg foo.pjp (foo being any file name)
8) Double click on these icons. 

* RESULT
 - What happened
 
Mozilla does not load any of these images despite these extensions being listed 
in the desktop integration preferences as valid JPEG extensions. 

 - What was expected 

Either these extensions should be removed from the Desktop Integration 
preferences or we should be supporting them correctly. 

I'm not sure how important they are; Internet Explorer doesn't support any of 
them either.

CORE-45891,2000-07-19,Networking,CORE,IPv6: Host header is wrong in requests to IPv6 literal addresses,"(This bug report is largely thanks to David Madore.  I tracked down the specific
RFC grammar references.)

When one uses Mozilla to retrieve a URL with a literal IPv6 address
and port number e.g.

        http://[::1]:8088/foo/

(this means get relative /foo/ from HTTP server on port 8088 of the
loopback address (::1) using the syntax defined by RFC 2732) the
request it sends to the port is something like this:

GET /foo/ HTTP/1.1
Host: ::1:8088
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux 2.2.17pre10-emerald i686; en-US; m17)
Gecko/20000709
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Encoding: gzipdeflatecompressidentity
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive

Note in particular the Host header.  RFC 2617 (HTTP) defines the syntax of the
Host header as:

       Host = Host : host [ : port ] ; Section 3.2.2

Section 3.2.2 gives the grammar of the http URL.  Therefore for IPv6 literal
addresses the Host header needs to follow the RFC 2732 grammar for host just
as with URLs:

      host          = hostname | IPv4address | IPv6reference
      IPv6reference = [ IPv6address ]

Without this the server cannot tell whether what is meant is port 8088 of
host ::1 rather than (default) port 80 of host ::1:8088 (which is a
valid IPv6 address).

The correct way for the Host header to appear in this request is

Host: [::1]:8088

Experimentally using the KAME IPv6 patch for Apache-1.3.12 it seems
that the latter syntax is recognized (and the former is not)",jgmyers,lennox,fixed,1,resolved,4,2002-12-14,0,15,2000-08-17,29,normal,2

unittest and builds in the same master

Basically this is a copy of the Buildbot configs running on staging-master:/builds/buildbot/hg-unittest-master (note that this is locally patched from the mozilla2-unittest configs).

I've modified the steps slightly to checkout mozconfigs from the new location not run an HgPoller of its own etc.

The mozconfigs have been made as consistent as the dep/nightly ones as possible.
The Builders have been renamed to be consistent with their dep/nightly/leak test counterparts.
The soon-to-be-created slaves have been added to the slavelists for dep/nightly/leak test + unittest builds.
The commented out win32 builder has been completely removed.

Most importantly unittests will now be run on the same master as the rest of our builds.

I think that's everything. It's a big looking patch but the bulk of unittest_master.cfg is unchanged.

We can avoid an AddRef/Release pair and in some cases virtual methods.

For example for .parentNode we'd have one QI call to get the thisptr offsets (no AddRef) some bit twiddling (reinterpret_cast(mParentPtrBits & ~kParentBitMask)) and then wrapping which will use the cached wrapper if the parent node has been wrapped before (no AddRef/Release of parent node or its wrapper in that case).

I've also moved a bunch of the base functions to implement nsIDOMNode from nsGenericDOMDataNode/nsGenericElement/nsDocument to nsINode. I haven't done it for all of them on nsDocument/nsDOMAttribute. For example GetNext/PreviousSibling currently directly return null I could call through to the base implementation on nsINode which would fail on GetNodeParent and then return null. Not sure if we want to do that instead.

Is this an intentional and meaningful design pattern the code uses here? This will also negatively impact V8's hidden classes approach (not sure about SFX).

Disabled XUL buttons still seem to depress even if they're disabled.  You can 
see this with the remove buttons in the image/cookie manager if you have no 
blocked sites or cookies.  

These lines in button.css are calling the problem:

  button:hover:active 
    {
      border              : 1px solid threeddarkshadow;
    }

  button:hover:active > .button-box-1
    {
      border              : 1px solid threedshadow;
    }

  button:hover:active > .button-box-1 > .button-box-2
    {
      border              : 1px solid threedface;
    }

So obviously the solution is to add a border style to this rule:

  button[disabled=true]
  button[disabled=true]:hover:active
    {
      color               : graytext;
    }

However I can't figure out which border to set.  I tried various ones 
including 0px and though they had different effects none had *no* effect 
(which is what's needed here).  So basically I can't figure out what border a 
normal disabled button has (because that's the border we need to set for button
[disabled=true]:hover:active so nothing seems to happen on click)",hewitt,bugzilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,18,2001-01-29,184,normal,2

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.74 [en] (WinNT; U)
BuildID:    2000072909

Images inside table cells which are (relative) positioned via a CSS style may 
lead to an increased row height of the table.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with an IMG inside a TD. Add some text to another TD
2. Move the IMG down by adding a CSS style like {position:relative; top:100px;}

Actual Results:  3. The table will behave as if the following CSS style has been 
used for the TD {padding-top:100px;} ie. the row height will be increased as 
much is needed to keep the img inside the cells boundary.							

Expected Results:  My understanding of relative positioning is something like 
this:
Do initial layout -> Move relative positioned elements (w.o. changing the 
layout). I would expect that the tables row height should not change if I move 
the IMG via CSS (BTW. what may happen if the IMG is moved up?).

			<tabpanel id=OnlineOrgTabPanel align=vertical

If I remove all the tabbing code i.e. change this fragment to 

	
	
	

			
				<tab onclick=TellParentTab('Online');

				<tab onclick=TellParentTab('Setup');

then the xul displays (albeit it looks very weird as that is not the desired 
look).

Based on reading the code nsDocument::InsertBefore has the following bugs:

1) If aNewChild is an element node (and there is no root node) aRefChild is
ignored.  aRefChild should be found.  If it doesn't exist NOT_FOUND_ERR should
be thrown.  If it does exist you need to shift content between prolog and
epilog.

2) If refChild is null:
 + there's code that's no longer necessary for handling the ELEMENT_NODE case
 + I think the test for appending to Epilog vs. Prolog should be simply whether
mRootContent is null (if null append to Prolog else Epilog)

3) content (and in some cases refContent) are leaked almost wherever an
exception is thrown.  Here you should probably just use nsCOMPtr - it's too
messy otherwise.

4) In the section where refContent is used it might be slightly more defensive
to:
 + use a boolean to make sure the node isn't added twice (in case there's
already duplicated content...)
 + also make sure mRootContent != null when testing (refContent == mRootContent)",dbaron,dbaron,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,19,2001-01-25,172,normal,2

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.1b3) Gecko/20090305 Firefox/3.1b3

Firefox do not hide the whole HTML text when it has text-decoration: blink and has a text-shadow too. A small piece of the shadow (right side) is still visible when the text is hidden. Or the shadow isn't rendered completely when the text is visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the following CSS rule: .example { text-decoration: blink; text-shadow: #cc0000 3px 3px 5px; }
2. Create the following HTML: OMG no BUG?Bug?Ka booooom!. See what happens.
3. Put a ! on OMG at the  element (OMG! no BUG?). See what happens.
4. Make the wtf? face =)
Actual Results:  
At step 2 you get three blinking texts each with a different result (showing three forms of the bug). At step 3 you get three blinking texts all with the same issue: the shadow not being rendered completely.

Expected Results:  
At step 2 you get three blinking texts each with a different result (showing three forms of the bug). At step 3 you get three blinking texts all with the same issue: the shadow not being rendered completely.

I was reading about CSS2 at W3Schools and they had a example to show text-decoration. Their show-case page is http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-decoration. There I wanted to try text-shadow a little so I added a text-shadow to the H1 element. Then I wanted to see how a blinking text would look with a shadow. Then I added the text-shadow to the H4 element and... bam! I though it might be the IFRAME they use... So I created a HTML with a test HTML code (a H1 H2 and H3 with some text) and a CSS (a class which was applied to the H1 H2 and H3 elements) I got the same result.

Basic issues:

1) Thunderbird blocks anything non-RSS.
2) Thunderbird ignores the general cookie preferences
3) We don't pass the cookie tests because of 1).

The issues with the current cookie system are:

- Thunderbird overrides the core cookie policy because:

Most users suggested they would like to see a dialog that informed them that the
message was saved and indicated WHERE the message was saved.

to have issue.  I believe this is something that users encounter often when they
are first using a product.  Once users are comfortable with how this feature
works they often no longer want/need to see a confirmation.

Recommendation: I would recommend displaying a dialog Your message has been

MAILNEWS_CORE-49703,2000-08-21,Internationalization,MAILNEWS_CORE,Length returned by Unicode to UTF8 Converter is always wrong.,"From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.7 [en]C-AOLNSCP  (WinNT; U)
BuildID:    20000819

PSM uses the intl libraries to convert between Unicode and UTF8 when doing 
PKCS12 (cert import and export).  When we call the encoder to translate from 
Unicode to UTF8 the length that gets returned for the resulting string is 
always wrong.  Often its value is greater than the original Unicode string.	

This is how we get the decoder 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/psm/lib/nlslayer/nlslayer.cpp#109 
and this is our implementation of the conversion into a C interface 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/psm/lib/nlslayer/nlslayer.cpp#237					

This is our current work-around for the problem.  
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/psm/server/p12res.c#511

Only problem is that on the Mac this never works.  There is always some garbage 
at the end of the string.

We need to get the coorect return value for the length so that we don't have to 
code up such workarounds which may or may not work when Japanese characters 
start appearing in certificates.

This is a regression for Bug 358569 - Crash @ js_dtoa/jsdtoa.c when running with reduced CPU float precision e.g. after loading Direct3D plugin. It is always reproducible on mozilla-central Mercurial tip 396f9743df7b from 22 June 2009 with our plugin that uses Direct3D. See bug 358569 for all details and fixes.

The reason for the regression is that the bug was fixed in jsdtoa.cpp but Mercurial commit a5fc387c4622 took the upstream dtoa.c and removed the dtoa code from jsdtoa.cpp. During the move the fix for this bug and maybe more modifications were lost. Related to the same problem some code was added to detect the situation in Debug builds and warn the plugin developers see Bug 360282 - Warn about broken FPU. This was also lost in the above commit.

I suspect that this was also the cause for the Shockwave crash which I suppose placed dtoa in the table at https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Topcrashes since Shockwave can be set to use hardware acceleration via Direct3D. A relevant bug report may be: Bug 466659 - Crash on conquerorgame.com possibly related to Bug 449118  exception_access_violation [@ dtoa ]. If this one doesn't appear anymore it's probably because Adobe changed Shockwave to use the D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE flag in the Direct3D CreateDevice function.

ftp.mozilla.org. Drew suggested giving selected users shell 
accounts and having people access the machine via ssh/scp.
Permission to write into various sections of the ftp area can
be controlled by unix groups.

Its my understanding that the machine has been ordered and will take
a couple weeks to arrive. (and then a while longer to configure).

We need to coordinate with leaf to get his build automation using this
new machine and with risto to get the ftp site using this.

The new machine will need a working name. How about ftp-stage.mozilla.org?

We need to make a policy about how people get access to the machine.
I suggest using the same criteria that we already use for giving access to 
the source tree. That is people should sign a contributor form. Eventually
add fields to despot (our user db) for ssh key and ftp group and
generate accounts automatically. For now lets do this by hand and
ask for accounts one at a time.

These people all need accounts on the machine.

MOZILLA.ORG-50520,2000-08-28,Miscellaneous,MOZILLA.ORG,CVS Contributor Forms don't always reach their destination.,"Mozilla.org provides a means for people who wish to contribute to this project
to fill out and sign a CVS Contributor Form which they can then send to Daniel
(Leaf) Nunes. As I understand it since postal mail can take a while to reach
its destiny even more so from places outside the US an option has been
provided to fax in the form where the fax can act as a placeholder till the
mail arrives.

It seems however there's something wrong with the datatransport from the
destination fax machine to leaf's hands. I sent a fax on the 22nd of August
11:06 pm PST which correctly arrived[0] at the designated fax# (650 937 5413)
but never reached leaf's hands.

I've heard problem has happened before though faxes do seem to reach leaf from
time to time.

[0] Had the receiving fax been broken the sending fax would've gotten a
notification of that.

Some ideas as to what may cause this problem:
1a) leaf has a fan or fans stealing his faxes/mail
1b) someone is stealing these faxes for autographs from potentially very famous
people
2) sabotage from within
3) these faxes mistakenly get batched together with other faxes with another
final destination and from there go in the will return this to the fax machine
when I remember to queue
4) these faxes are in the fax machine's out queue for a while and then get sent
to the bin before leaf has a chance to collect them.
5) hungry secretaries

One solution which seems to fix most of these problems is to give leaf his own
fax though it may not be adequate against 1a 1b or 2. I suggest some further
research is done into this problem and a suitable solution is applied.

Repeatable: yes though it seems to be a data race kind of problem

Steps to take:
1. Fill out CVS Contributor Form and sign it
2. Fax form to 650 937 5413
3. Ask leaf from time to time if he has the fax yet

Current behaviour: the fax sometimes gets lost

Expected behaviour: the fax always reaches leaf (for 99.99% values of always)

Further comments:
This is a rather serious problem since it discourages potential contributors
from sending faxes thereby adding unnecessary overhead to the contribution
process. It can also not be a good thing that leaf gets asked repeatedly about
faxes reaching him by people who get more frustrated over time.",mozillamarcia.knous,jag+mozbugs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-02-16,0,10,2001-02-16,172,normal,2

INstead only the h1 is displayed and the rest is not rendered at all. This test

Galeon being the GNOME web browser of choice and without basic authentication it

The GetInterface does not check for the IID to be nsIPrompt. Thus when
nsWebBrowser::LoadURI is run no nsIPrompter notification callback is registered.

I'm working on a robust method to detect @font-face support across browsers. (http://paulirish.com/2009/font-face-feature-detection/)

Firefox 3.5 is offering inconsistent results than the other supporting browsers (Saf4Opera10).

The root of it is this in pseudocode

var oldwidth = elem.offsetWidth;
elem.style.fontFamily = 'atfontfacefont';
var newwidth = elem.offsetWidth;
return oldwidth !== newwidth;

This should return true indicating the new font has changed the display of the text. In Firefox 3.5 newwidth has the exact same value has oldwidth.

However if you check elem.offsetWidth again in a setTimeout (with 0ms delay) loop the value will be updated and different.

This appears to be a bug as this behavior is not consistent with installed (local) fonts.


I should mention: in the testcase the font data is included by way of a data: URI as to make sure there is no external dependency.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. check offsetWidth of an element
2. change element's font to an @font-face asset
3. check offsetWidth again.
Actual Results:  
width does not change.

Expected Results:

SEAMONKEY-5159,1999-04-15,Build Config,SEAMONKEY,[PP]Unix build instructions are out of date.,"These are the changes i propose for the unic build instructions at:

http://www.mozilla.org/build/unix.html

I propose making 2 pages.

The first one is small not intimidating and fits in one screen full.
There should be no technicalities in this page.  There should be links
to pages where thse techincalities are explained though.

The second page can have whatever technicalities and complications that
are needed for whatever reason in whatever order i dont care about
this.

Notes:

+ The redhat linux page is not really needed.  The gtk rpm thing can
  go in the requirements section in page two.

+ Change LD_LIBRARY_PATH and MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME references to using
 ./mozilla-apprunner.sh.  This is what we will ship and how the
  app should (and will be) run.

+ Take out anything that references NSPR rpms.  This is not our problem
  anymore now that nspr can be built and used in the tree.

+ autoconf and m4 are not needed.  Except if you are an autoconf hacker.
  I guess you need to divide the requirements section into 2 one for
  build requirements for mortals and one for hackers.

+ The glibc2.07 patch reference is completely useless. No one in their
  right mind will rebuild glibc after applying this patch.  If you must
  reference this bug provide a link to the rpms on mozilla.org.

The idea im trying to get across is that we need to use hyperlink
technology to unclutter the main page.

thanks.

1.  Introduction

  LEAVE AS IS

2.  Get the code

  LEAVE AS IS

3.  Requirements

    Before proceeding please see (two.html#requirements) for a list
    of requirements (stuff needed to build mozilla)

4.  Automated build (client.mk)

  For a list of mozilla requirements see (two.html#requirements)

  o cvs co mozilla/client.mk
  o cd mozilla
  o gmake -f client.mk

  To rebuild without pulling the tree:

  o gmake -f client.mk build_all

  To just pull the tree:

  o gmake -f client.mk pull_all

  There is a build configurator tools that allows you to configure
  your build using a web browser.  See (LINK TO BUILD CONFIGURATOR)
  for more information.

5. Manual build

  o mkdir mozilla
  o cd mozilla
  o ./configure
  o gmake

  For configure options run ./configure --help

  Once you have configured you only have to run configure if you add or
  remove Makefile.in files (cvs update can do this. Beware!).

  The list of makefiles is in mozilla/allmakefiles.sh.

  Please see (two.html#details) for build system details and power user
  features.

6.  After the build

  o cd dist/bin
  o ./mozilla-apprunner.sh
  o ./mozilla-viewer.sh

For more information on the mozilla build system platform specific
hacks please see (two.html#details).

NSS-52091,2000-09-10,Libraries,NSS,Multiple RSA private keys ops used to unwrap SSL premaster secret,"The function pk11_AnyUnwrapKey which is called to unwrap/decrypt 
SSL3's RSA_encrypted pre-master secret can perform up to 3 RSA
private key operations on the input in the course of its operations.

It appears that in NSS 3.0 (rev 1.4 of pk11skey.c) pk11_AnyUnwrapKey
behaved as follows:

a) if the token/mechanism supports the DECRYPT function call 
pk11_HandUnwrap().  If that succeeds stop.
b) call the token's C_UnwrapKey function.  If that succeeds stop.
c) Call pk11_HandUnwrap (possibly a second time).

pk11_HandUnwrap apparently always failed because it did not set the
CKA_VALUE attribute in the list of atributes for the decrypted value
when it attempted to import the value as a new key.  This was 
fixed in rev 1.9 of pk11skey.c

This meant that pk11_AnyUnwrapKey was routinely doing two RSA 
private key ops one in HandUnwrap and another in C_UnwrapKey.

I believe pk11_AnyUnwrapKey should never do more than one RSA private
key operation.  If it calls PK11_HandUnwrap first it should be able
to discern among the following results from that call:
a) complete success
b) RSA decryption failed because it is not supported
c) RSA decryption produced garbage output (invalid PKCS#1 block)
d) RSA decryption succeeded (valid PKCS#1 block) but some 
subsequent operation failed e.g. creating a PKCS#11 key object 
with the decrypted data;

and not attempt any more functions that would cause RSA operations
except in the case that the RSA decryption failed because it was 
not supported (and hence wasn't done).

Second I believe pk11_AnyUnwrapKey should remember when it has 
tried pk11_HandUnwrap and should not call pk11_HandUnwrap a 
second time if it has already been called once during the present 
invocation of pk11_AnyUnwrapKey.

Third unless HandUnwrap is always preferable to C_UnwrapKey I 
think it would be better to not try pk11_HandUnwrap before 
C_UnwrapKey unless the latter is not supported.",rrelyea,nelson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2000-09-26,0,7,2000-09-26,16,critical,5

CORE-52416,2000-09-13,Editor,CORE,Editor does not accept NS_TEXT_EVENT while losing input focus,"UNIX IMEs sometimes invoke extra windows for operation
for example candidate window which grabs input focus.
As I described the problem in 

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29065

IME wants to draw pre-edit text (composed text) while
the candidate window is invoked.

It seems that Editor does not accept NS_TEXT_EVENT
for updating pre-edit text by the recent changes in
Editor and Layout (/event?). When I filed a bug 29065
Editor could accept NS_TEXT_EVENT so I could see
the pre-edit text was updated event when candidate
window is invoked. However it does not work on the
current build.

How to reproduce:

1) Start Mozilla
2) Visit www.yahoo.com
3) Click on text field for Search
4) Turn conversion on by Shift+SPACE
5) Type a i
6) Invoke candidate window by SPACE SPACE
   Main window of Mozilla will loose the input focus

7) Select a candidate
   candidate window will be closed and the selected text
   will be drawn on the text field but it won't.
   The first candidate word is still displayed. 

8) type return to commit the word
   The correct word is committed which means the word
   drawn in 7) is not correct.

Clicking with the middle mouse button anywhere in the folder and message lists opens a new tab. This also happen when no folder or message is directly under the mouse pointer and when no message is selected opening an empty tab.

Tested this on the latest nightly with an newly created profile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure no messages are selected (ctrl-space can be used to deselect the last selected message if necessary)
2. Move the mouse pointer in an empty area of the message list e.g. below the last item
3. Click using the middle mouse button

Actual Results:  

A new tab opens in the background without any content. In general however I find strange the fact that middle click affects the current selection instead of the current mouse target as it usually does on Firefox.

Expected Results:  

Middle-clicking in an empty area of the folder or message list should in my opinion deselect the current folder or message and no other action should be performed.

Yet another event dispatch optimization.
Make the method inline and look for event listener manager (of the elements)
only if there might be one.
The change to nsEventDispatcher::Dispatch (PR_TRUE->PR_FALSE) is possible because by default all the targets may have an ELM but elements mark the flag 
false if they don't have an ELM. If new ELMs are created during dispatch
createdELMs != nsEventListenerManager::sCreatedCount checks cause us to
check for ELM for the target.

The trick was just to remove the database name from the connect string.  It was 
trying to log into the database server and select that database in one fell 
swoop but that was a bad thing because we didn't know the database exists yet at 
that point.  Now it logs into the server but doesn't select a database (which is 
good because we're logging in at this point in order to see what databases are 
there - we don't even know what's there yet).

In one page the language clearly isn't english (I had just started taking a medication and was worried I was going crazy) and in the other the formatting is irregular.  Kohei (last edited by) probably forgot a . 

Expected Results:  
It should have been in english and properly formatted.  In fact the docs should have been complete but I will make efforts to rectify that myself.

I think we should forward modal dialogs like alert prompt confirm etc
from content to chrome process.
There is one problem with nsIDialogParamBlock it has .objects attribute.
It is used rarely (for example in cookie handling). Perhaps .objects could be 
removed and force callers to use other things in nsIDialogParamBlock (which could 
be extend to have some kind of hashtable or something). Though 
nsIDialogParamBlock is pretty strange API.

WEBSITES_GRAVEYARD-550157,2010-03-04,www.drumbeat.org,WEBSITES_GRAVEYARD,* Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2010-001,"* Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2010-001
  * Project: Drupal core
  * Version: 5.x 6.x
  * Date: 2010-March-03
  * Security risk: Critical
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.
.... Installation cross site scripting

A user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing a
malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting attack. The
exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed. This issue affects
Drupal 6.x only.
.... Open redirection

The API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack. An
attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site to
send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL. No user submitted data will be
sent to that URL. This issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.
.... Locale module cross site scripting

Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display
of language codes native and English language names properly. While these
usually come from a preselected list arbitrary administrator input is
allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must
have a role with the 'administer languages' permission. This issue affects
Drupal 5.x and 6.x.
.... Blocked user session regeneration

Under certain circumstances a user with an open session that is blocked can
maintain his/her session on the Drupal site despite being blocked. This
issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.
-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.16.
  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.22.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:
  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to Drupal 6.16 [1].
  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to Drupal 5.22 [2].

Drupal 5 will no longer be maintained when Drupal 7 is released [3].
Upgrading to Drupal 6 [4] is recommended. If you are unable to upgrade
immediately you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are
able to do a proper upgrade. These patches fix the security vulnerabilities
but do not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 6.16 or Drupal
5.22.
  * To patch Drupal 6.15 use SA-CORE-2010-001-6.15.patch [5].
  * To patch Drupal 5.21 use SA-CORE-2010-001-5.21.patch [6].

-------- REPORTED BY  
---------------------------------------------------------

The installation cross site scripting issue was reported by David Rothstein
[7] (*). The open redirection was reported by Martin Barbella [8]. The locale
module cross site scripting was reported by Justin Klein Keane [9]. The
blocked user session regeneration issue was reported by Craig A. Hancock
[10]. (*) Member of the Drupal security team.
-------- FIXED BY  
------------------------------------------------------------

The installation cross site scripting issue was fixed by Heine Deelstra [11].
The open redirection was fixed by Gerhard Killesreiter [12] and Heine
Deelstra [13]. The locale module cross site scripting was fixed by Stéphane
Corlosquet [14] Peter Wolanin [15] Heine Deelstra [16] and Neil Drumm [17].
The blocked user session regeneration issue was fixed by Gerhard Killesreiter
[18]. All the fixes were done by members of the Drupal security team.

that this is a debug build so no compiler optimizations
are enabled.

That's a good question. See my comment below.

I checked again just to be sure; there is nothing explicitly stated in
the contributor form concerning the case where one person checks in code
on behalf of another person. I'll forward this to staff@mozilla.org for
comments and if you'd like you can also file a bug against
mozilla.org to have this be clarified in a future version of the form?
(We need a new version of the form anyway because the crypto-related
language is outdated.)

without fetching them again from the network regardless if they are cachable
or not. Therefore *all* pages should be cached if not in disk cache then in
memory cache for re-use within the current session when requested by browsing
in session history.

One special case are results of a HTTP POST (see bug 55055). In that case we
must be able to associate the cache entry with the post data or a dedicated
session history entry.

Reasons are explained in RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1):

--8<----

13.13 History Lists

   User agents often have history mechanisms such as Back buttons and
   history lists which can be used to redisplay an entity retrieved
   earlier in a session.

   History mechanisms and caches are different. In particular history
   mechanisms SHOULD NOT try to show a semantically transparent view of
   the current state of a resource. Rather a history mechanism is meant
   to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the resource was
   retrieved.

   By default an expiration time does not apply to history mechanisms.
   If the entity is still in storage a history mechanism SHOULD display
   it even if the entity has expired unless the user has specifically
   configured the agent to refresh expired history documents.

   This is not to be construed to prohibit the history mechanism from
   telling the user that a view might be stale.

      Note: if history list mechanisms unnecessarily prevent users from
      viewing stale resources this will tend to force service authors
      to avoid using HTTP expiration controls and cache controls when
      they would otherwise like to. Service authors may consider it
      important that users not be presented with error messages or
      warning messages when they use navigation controls (such as BACK)
      to view previously fetched resources. Even though sometimes such
      resources ought not to cached or ought to expire quickly user
      interface considerations may force service authors to resort to
      other means of preventing caching (e.g. once-only URLs) in order
      not to suffer the effects of improperly functioning history
      mechanisms.

CORE-56381,2000-10-12,XUL,CORE,Can still tab to other widgets while  is open (dropped),"Overview Description:

  Certain keystrokes are accepted when an XUL menulist is dropped but 
shouldn't be.

Steps to Reproduce:
  1) Search > Search Bookmarks/History
  2) Click the menulist next to Find items in to drop it down.
  3) Press tab.

Actual Results:   The next  widget receives the focus.  Using the down
                  arrow key you can then dropdown that  meaning two
                  's will be dropped at once (which obviously
                  shouldn't be allowed).
Expected Results: Nothing.  Tab shouldn't work to cycle focus between widgets if
                  a  is dropped.

Reproducibility: 100% Classic win98se new branch build

Additional Information:
  Same result with many 's throughout app.",mikepinkerton,bugzilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,7,2000-12-21,70,normal,2

Ok basically every time you include a js file you get that js file again since
they aren't cached so all over the product we have 65423 people including
strres.js over and over. The binding is cached ;) Plus strres also has a bunch
of other shit that no one ever uses in it.


Currently there are 83 .xul files including strres.js which could benefit from
Ben's . I suggest we move to .

The migration is simple:
In the xul file:
- add a 
- remove the strres.js reference
In the js file:
- replace the stringbundle fetching code with a document.getElementById('foo');
- replace .GetStringFromName(property) with .getString(property)

Longer audio-only WebM files seem to work just fine. Same with short Ogg/Vorbis files. I took one of my Ogg/Vorbis files and put its audio stream into a WebM file and it stopped working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://kaioa.com/k/ct/firefox/blam.ogg
2. Open http://kaioa.com/k/ct/firefox/blam.webm
Actual Results:  
First one plays (as it should) second one is silent. Same result if the Video or Audio element is used.

Expected Results:  
It should be possible to play very short WebM/Vorbis files. It's essential for games (Canvas/WebGL).

I am working with thunderbird 3.04 with IMAP server. Sometimes when trying to view or save attachments they are saved as 27 bytes files instead of the original file. I have noticed that this might happen when the message was selected and I selected another message before the original message was downloaded completely. When returning back to the original message that has the attachments all attachments were saved as this 27 bytes file. Restarting thunderbird has no effect over this. It seems that the cache of the message gets corrupt and does not get fixed.

This bug means that the cache does not make sure that the attachment was downloaded correctly before it is being saved to the cache.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I did not manage to reproduce it at all times
1. Have a slow connection to your IMAP server and the inbox folder set to be synchronized for offline usage.
2. Select a message with attachments
3. Select another message and let it load
4. Reselect the original message with attachments and try to open or save the attachments.
Actual Results:  
This will result in a 27 bytes file and not the attachment.

Expected Results:  
Should have saved the original attachment.",fvroman,mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2019-02-13,7,106,2017-04-25,2512,critical,5

CORE-57524,2000-10-21,DOM: CSS Object Model,CORE,[FIX]styleSheet .disabled not reset when  element changes preferred stylesheet [AltSS],"STEPS TO REPRODUCE
   Cause the following to happen during a document load:
     1. A preferred stylesheet is declared.
     2. The default style is set to another title.
     3. The new preferred stylesheet is declared.
   The attached testcase does this with something like these three lines:
      
      
      
   ...where each line corresponds to the respective step above.

EXPECTED RESULTS
   The first stylesheet should be disabled and the DOM should say it is 
   disabled; the second should be enabled. Thus going to View|Use Stylesheet
   should show a single bullet next to the last item.

ACTUAL RESULTS
   The first stylesheet is correctly disabled but the DOM claims that both 
   stylesheets are enabled. That is the disabled attribute of the styleSheet
   interface is 'false' for both stylesheets. This can be seen in the alternate
   stylesheets menu as both items are selected.

The testcase attempts to show this. The marked and actually comments should
be the same. At the moment the results read:
   1. Alternate Stylesheet (marked ENABLED actually DISABLED)
   2. Preferred Stylesheet (marked ENABLED actually ENABLED)
It _should_ read:
   1. Alternate Stylesheet (marked DISABLED actually DISABLED)
   2. Preferred Stylesheet (marked ENABLED actually ENABLED)
...that is the alternate stylesheet line should say it is marked DISABLED. This
works fine if you actually _switch_ (using the menu) to one of the stylesheets.

on WinNT 4.0 SP4

I have *many* bookmarks and *many* folders with sublists of bookmarks. (Enough
total bookmarks and folders in the top-level bookmarks list that it scrolls
*way* off the bottom of the screen.) Currently I'm unable to access the
bookmarks in the folders which are more than halfway down the list.

Reason? It turns out that the code that is calculating where on the screen to
display the second-level submenu of bookmarks (i.e. the bookmarks that are
contained in a top-level bookmark folder) has an increasingly large error the
further down the list you go:

1) if the folder is on the first page-height of bookmarks the submenu displays
just fine and just to the right of the bookmark folder as you would expect
2) if the folder is on the second page-height of bookmarks you notice that the
submenu displays at a position on the screen that is vertically offset from
where it should be; the X position of the submenu is right (just to the right of
the first-level bookmarks list) but the Y position of the submenu is closer to
the top of the screen than it should be
3) the further you go down the top-level list of bookmarks/folders the worse
the problem gets until ultimately you see just a 1-pixel-wide sliver of the
bottom of the submenu along the top of the screen and ultimately you see
nothing at all

This renders the bookmarks in those subfolders inaccessible.

Reorganizing your bookmark list to have more deeply nested folders (and thus a
shorter top-level list) *might* be a workaround although I haven't tried this.

This is a serious problem for anyone who has a long list of bookmarks.

Items in the image cache get mixed around.  Images from one web site (known to

Reloading the page several times and going to different pages and coming back
appears to have no effect.  That is the same images are mapped via the cache to
the same other (wrong) images even after loading several other pages.  Thus
the cache corruption rate is probably low (memory leak?).  Server returns [304
not modified] every time for these images.  Images that get mixed up are of
different dimensions (sizes) and mozilla rescales them where they appear.
Forced reload (shift-reload) does not restore correct images.  (does
shift-reload work under mozilla as it did under netscape?)  Forced reload causes
mozilla to reload same image in an endless loop (image is

SEAMONKEY-58557,2000-10-31,Preferences,SEAMONKEY,Mozilla allows you to override internal MIME types to no effect,"Build ID: current CVS build from today

 Edit | Preferences | Navigator | Helper Applications allows people to create
entries for MIME types for MIME types that Mozilla already handles internally.
As far as I can see these user-set entries will be then ignored surprising
the user (who is having their apparently valid preferences ignored).

 Steps to reproduce:
1. Open up the Helper Applications whatever-you-want-to-call-it bit of
   Preferences.
2. Add an entry for 'image/jpeg' that runs an external program to view the
   JPEG image.
3. click an appropriate number of OK buttons; observe that Mozilla doesn't
   emit any messages about it.
4. Type the URL of the JPEG image of your choice into Mozilla or visit a
   page with a JPEG on it and use 'View Image'.
5. Observe that Mozilla has not used the just-set user MIME type information
   to display the JPEG image and is thus ignoring it.

 I think that Mozilla should warn people if they are trying to do something
with a helper application that it is going to ignore. (I assume that not
ignoring it is an RFE and not a bug and have filed that as bug #58554.)",cbiesinger,cks+mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2005-11-22,3,33,2003-07-14,986,minor,2

I ran into this case today which confused me regarding using Send Later/Send
Unsent messages... talked to Seth about it he also suggested Rich/rhp might
already have something logged about the cause so cc:ing Seth and Rich.

Had created a new profile used initial Activation screen to activate a Webmail
account which became the default account.  Added some other POP and IMAP
accounts on nsmail-1 so the Account Settings showed Outgoing SMTP as nsmail-1.
Using said profile I did the following steps:

1.  Had launched to mail logged into all  accounts.
2.  Composed messages from an nsmail-1 IMAP and nsmail-1 POP account used Send
Later for those messages.  Messages were properly showing in Local
Folders/Unsent Messages.
3.  Collapsed the default account before exiting.
4.  Relaunched to mail File|Send Unsent Messages.
    I was prompted for smtp login to Webmail account.  This confused me since I
believed nsmail-1 to be the outgoing/SMTP server.  I checked Account Settings
and saw only one SMTP server listed nsmail-1.

Seth said this is probably because we don't store the identity for the unsent
message to track to server or copy-to-Sent folder or anything.  When I went to
send the Unsent messages it used the default account which happened to be
Webmail and wasn't what I assumed would be the SMTP server.

Once I changed the default account to one of the other (nsmail-1) accounts this
scenario didn't prompt me for Webmail smtp password.

So Seth thought we should probably store the ID to use the appropriate server
for this (smtp) situation as well as other possible situations with copy to Sent
folder etc.",ch.ey,laurel,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,3,45,2003-03-22,864,normal,2

TOOLKIT-59687,2000-11-09,Form Manager,TOOLKIT,Wallet should use displayble text to determine meaning of fields,"THE WAY IT IS
-------------

Currently wallet tries to identify the meaning of a field by examining the value 
of the name attribute of the html input tag.  Sometime a website uses meaningful 
names (like zipcode) which makes this job simple.  But more often than not 
they use cryptic names (like 3.0.3.27.1.1.31.11.16.9.11 -- yes that's what is 
actually found on the apple site for the zipcode field).

So wallet uses a table that contains URL-specific mappings for determining the 
meaning of field names used on specific websites.  That table has to be quite 
large in order to support a large number of websites.  But no matter how large 
it is there will still be many websites that would not be supported.

Furthermore the table is hosted on a server and pinged at the beginning of 
every browser session to see if it has changed and needs to be redownloaded.  
This also requires a procedure for maintaining the table on the server and to 
date none has been put in place.  And it requires a lot of specialized code in 
the browser to do the downloading in background mode.

THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
--------------------

Rather than using the name attribute of the input tag wallet could use the 
displayable text preceding the input tag.  That's much more meaningful because 
it has to mean something to the user who is viewing it.  This would allow the 
entire mechanism for dealing involving URL-specific mappings to be discarded.  
Significant reduction in the amount of data actually stored in memory.  And no 
longer any need to do dynamic updates for a server site.",morse,morse,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,24,2003-12-19,1135,normal,2

The Kraken audio-fft and audio-beat-detection benchmarks use most of their time doing arithmetic on NaN and undefined which does not seem like something JS engines should optimize for. :)

The problem is that reverseTable in these benchmarks is an Array which is initialized with undefined values. The original code uses a Uint32Array which is initialize with 0 (and incorrectly uses an Array when Uint32Arrays are not present). The code should zero initialize the array.

Adding some sort of verification that the benchmark computes the right thing would be good. That would have caught this and it could help catch invalid optimizations in the future for all the JS engine implementors.

My proposal is that we have a category called apprunner-startup which
components register themselves in. When mozilla starts we can automatically
enumerate these startup components notify them that startup has begun and
release them.

See note from Beltzner who does this currently:

There are two separate tools here:

1. SVN. File a bug against mozilla.org::server operations to get access to the SVN repository for www.mozilla.com. You'll need to attach your public key (folks in the bug will help you with that if you don't already have one). You can use SVN to:

 - edit the files on the trunk server (www-trunk.stage.mozilla.com)
 - merge those changes to the staging server (www.authstage.mozilla.com)
 - merge those changes to the production server (www.mozilla.com)

2. Kubla. This is a web tool which allows you to move changes from trunk -> staging -> production without having to download the full repositories for all those servers to your local machine. Access is granted by a request to mozilla.org::server operations and is provided by LDAP.

I use SVN to commit changes to the trunk and then use Kubla to move them into staging for final testing before then using Kubla to push them live. Christian just uses SVN for all three stages. Up to your level of comfort.",jlaz,clooney,fixed,1,resolved,4,2010-11-04,0,10,2010-11-04,10,normal,2
CORE-60789,2000-11-20,ImageLib,CORE,Update MNG code,"The version of libmng in the mozilla tree dates from August 8th (0.9.2+)
while the current version is 0.9.3+.  I would like to update the tree to
the latest code and also tweak the mngcom code to match.  I've tested the
new code againt Gerard's JNG and MNG test suites along with a couple other
collections of MNG images.

The nsMNGDecoder.cpp diff is attached.  It contains the following changes:

  * remove NO_ALPHA debugging option
  * use mng_get_alphadepth() to figure out the alpha needs of the [jm]ng.
      this fixes a problem where all JNGs were using thresholded alpha

The libmng update diff is 19454 lines which I'm assuming that mozilla people
aren't interested in reviewing.  Contact me if you're interested in the diff.
The changes between the current mozilla version and the last code are these:

+- version numbers
+- fixed possible loop in display_resume() (Thanks Vova!)
+- fixed unwanted repetition in mng_readdisplay()
+- changed inclusion of the lcms header file for non-windows platforms

+- fixed DEFI behavior
+- fixed inclusion parameters to make the external libs work together
+- added export of zlib functions from windows dll
+- fixed timing & refresh behavior for single PNG/JNG

CORE-61269,2000-11-27,Networking,CORE,'%' will get URL-escaped to %25 if not followed by 2 hexadecimal digits,"From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.75 [en] (Win98; U)
BuildID:    200111908

Mozilla escapes '%' characters in a URL to %25 if the '%' is not followed by 
two hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F]. This URL both may be contained in a <A 
HREF=>-Statement or may be typed in directly into the URL bar. This escaping is 
very arbitrary and should be avoided due to its arbitrarity and incompatibility 
with current browsers. Just never encode '%' because '%' already is the 
encoding character.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://justchat4.medium.net:4000/chat/test/URLTest.html
2. Click on the link on that page.


Actual Results:  You will see (using mozilla):

Your data supplied is %u20AC test â0AC.


Expected Results:  You should see (as with Netscape 4.7 and IE5):

Your data supplied is € test â0AC.

You will see that mozilla escapes %u20AC but it keeps %e20AC so escaping is 
very arbitrary. Mozilla should not know better how to handle such URLs it 
just should pass them 1:1 to the server. Why? As a transition-mechanism I have 
to use %uHHHH-escapes to denote UTF16-characters not found in ASCII. Because I 
cannot know wether browsers URL-charset is Latin1 UTF8 or something else (and 
because URLs don't offer a reliable way to detect it) I need to use this. 
Escaping with '%' but not with a hexadecimal character after that '%' is one of 
the remaining namespace in URLs to be used. This mechanism is site specific and 
free of namespace conflicts as the unreliable Latin1 vs UTF8 transition.

As browsers have to pass URLs as given (at least to the site which generated the 
URL) I consider this a bug.",doug.turner,baldauf--2015--bugzilla.mozilla.org,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-10-11,0,36,2001-11-03,341,normal,2

Build Identifier: 4.0b7

I reopen this issue (previously discussed in Bug 601629 Bug 579138 and Bug 539771).

In those bugs it was said that the problem was Firefox not supporting canvas context creation attributes. This was said to be solved and the code at http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/941c3d14e14d takes into account attributes like antialiasHint.

Now looking at the current WebGL spec (2010-11-22) https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/WebGL-spec.html#5.2.1 it says:

- the antialising hint attribute is antialias
- its default value is true. So even without attributes WebGL should render with antialiasing enabled. (Chrome does it AFAIK)

These are maybe recent changes in the spec not sure...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page with WebGL content
2. Look at the edges of shapes

Actual Results:  
No antialiasing (even with context attributes antialias:true or antialiasHint:true
(tried 2010-11-30 minefield)

Expected Results:

RELEASE_ENGINEERING-620517,2010-12-20,General,RELEASE_ENGINEERING,20 talos-r3-xp slaves have older passwords - network setup issue,"NOTE: A lot of the information in this bug is now documented in this section which still needs review: https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/OPSI#Troubleshooting

After a slave is re-imaged we have to regenerate the OPSI hostkey on that slave (https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/OPSI#Wrong_hostkey).
I matched the hostkey on the slave (talos-r3-xp-001) to what is on the master which seems to do the trick.

What happens after is that (even though the OPSI master and the OPSI client can talk to each other) it tries to reach the wrong drive (P drive instead of Z drive). The P drive information is loaded from the registry.

Another way to notice this problem is that the prelogging screen takes forever (around 7 mins) before it logs into Windows (IMO it should not log-in at all or prevent buildbot from starting but this is a separate issue).
You can also notice that it says Mit Netzlaufwerken verbinden bitte noch etwas warten which means Connecting to network drives please wait a bit and a status at the bottom right that says code Status: 53. This code can be seen in the log below.

Switching the drive to Z: on the registry and rebooting the machine does *not* seem to fix the issue.
After rebooting the registry says P: again.
Could these values be loaded from the samba staging-opsi mount?
I can see the opt_pcbin on 'Samba 3.0.24 (10.2.71.216)' (Z:) mount on the machine.

I will try tomorrow to mount on P instead of Z and/or re-install once more (I did re-install from staging-opsi - 10.2.71.216).

The drive can be checked on the registry HKLM\SOFTWARE\opsi.org\shareinfo:

* depotdrive

BuildID:    2000120508

The attached cookperm.txt does not populate the Image Manager.  You can delete
any single line and the Image Manager will be populated correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place this cookperm.txt in a new user directory that has image and cookie
loading set to prompt.
2. Start Mozilla and open the Image Manager.  Notice the window is empty.
3. Exit Mozilla and edit the file to remove a line (say the first www.ground.com).
4. Start Mozilla and open the Image Manager.  Notice the window is populated
properly.

Actual Results:  The Image Manager window is empty but Cookie Manager has
content.  (If cookies have actually been set the Cookie List will also have
content.)

Expected Results:  Both before and after removing lines the Image Manager
should show all of the sites.

This is a very reduced version of my cookperm.txt.  I haven't exhaustively
tested removing each of the 230+ entries but the 10 random ones I removed

Expected result:

would be the Don't save button.)

NSS-62286,2000-12-07,Libraries,NSS,Race in cert code causes SEC_ERROR_BAD_DATABASE,"While testing some changes to the stress client on an MP box Quite a few
threads reported that PR_Write was returning error -8174 which is
SEC_ERROR_BAD_DATABASE.  This behavior was quite repeatable.

The problem is in the function NewTempCertificate() in pcertdb.c.
This function checks to see if the cert that it wishes to add to the 
temp cert DB is already known to the DB.  If not then it attempts to 
add the cert to the DB.  The problem is that it does not hold a lock around
the lookup and the add making the two operations into one atomic operation
on the DB.  

So several threads do the lookup they all conclude that it is not in the 
DB and they all attempt to add the cert to the DB. 
All but the first one of those attempts to add the cert to the DB fail 
because the cert is already in the DB.  

I intend to fix this as follows:

Implement a new function CERT_FindCertByDERCertNoLocking() 
which is just like CERT_FindCertByDERCert except that it calls
CERT_FindCertByKeyNoLocking (which already exists).  Then 
change NewTempCertificate() to get the lock before calling 
CERT_FindCertByKeyNoLocking instead of afterwords.",nelson,nelson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2000-12-07,0,2,2000-12-07,0,normal,2

This text will be displayed in a pop up box to users of Firefox versions no longer supported by Mozilla urging them to upgrade to the latest stable release of Firefox.

This is a very short translation (a few strings) but rather urgent one.

Here is what the final result will look like:
http://www-trunk.stage.mozilla.com/en-GB/firefox/unsupported/details/index.html

You will find on svn this new file in:

http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/projects/mozilla.com/trunk/en-GB/firefox/unsupported/details/index.html?revision=80193&content-type=text%2Fplain&view=co

Note that the last string (Not interested? Tell us why.) is currently not used we may use it in the future to propose a survey.

The file was added in your mozilla.com svn repository (/firefox/unsupported/details/index.htm) you just have to svn update your local copy to get it.

Reminder here is the svn repo url:
https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk/ab-CD

(replace ab-CD in the url by your locale code) 


You can either commit directly to svn (in this case indicate your commit revision number) or attach your translation to this bug and I will commit the file for you.

CORE-62566,2000-12-11,Networking,CORE,nsIChannel::AsyncWrite interface needs to be revised,"I've been thinking for some time now about changing the interface
of nsIChannel::AsyncWrite.  The way it is currently defined doesn't
seem to be very consistent with AsyncRead and my feeling is that
now is the right time to fix it.

I've been discussing this some on the newsgroup and with others in
the necko group.  There's been some interesting feedback.  Basically
my change to AsyncWrite is actually more or less a cosmetic change...
it is just a matter of clarifying what AsyncWrite really means.

What I want to do is change AsyncWrite from:

  AsyncWrite(in nsIInputStream source
             in nsIStreamObserver observer
             in nsISupports ctxt);

to

  AsyncWrite(in nsIStreamProvider provider
             in nsISupports ctxt);

where nsIStreamProvider is a new interface defined as:

  interface nsIStreamProvider : nsIStreamObserver
  {
    void onProvideData(in nsIChannel channel
                       in nsISupports ctxt
                       in nsIOutputStream output
                       in unsigned long offset
                       inout unsigned long count);
  };

The offset parameter is informational only and in most cases it
can simply be ignored.  It tells you what the current stream position
is and hence how much has been written.  The count parameter tells
you how much data you can write to the output stream w/o blocking.
On return from onProvideData the count parameter should indicate
the number of bytes actually written to the output stream.

The point is to make it very clear that the channel will request
data from the consumer when it knows that the underlying transport
is ready to accept it.  If you think about it this is no different
than having the channel call Read on the source input stream... it
just clarifies what we are really doing (IMO).

EOF would be indicated by returning NS_BASE_STREAM_CLOSE from the
consumer's onProvideData implementation.  If data were temporarily
unavailable the consumer's onProvideData could suspend the AsyncWrite
by returning NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK.  It would be up to the
consumer then to call Resume on the channel to continue the AsyncWrite
once there was more data for writing.

I'm attaching a preliminary nsIStreamProvider IDL file for review.",darin.moz,darin.moz,fixed,1,resolved,4,2002-12-16,0,31,2001-01-23,43,normal,2

to be a significant amount of code. In general the non-accessed DOM methods in

clicking on methods in PureCoverage I noticed that a fairly large number of them

delegation which would save code space in the layout dll?

This first appeared on http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f34826051dd5 which disabled a test in the same manifest.  That change looks correct.  The relevant part of the manifest is

Here's the relevant part of reftest.js

            // whether the comparison result matches what is in the manifest
            var test_passed = (equal == (gURLs[0].type == TYPE_REFTEST_EQUAL));
            // what is expected on this platform (PASS FAIL or RANDOM)
            var expected = gURLs[0].expected;
            output = outputs[expected][test_passed];

            ++gTestResults[output.n];

            var result = REFTEST  + output.s +  |  +
                         gURLs[0].prettyPath +  | ; // the URL being tested
            switch (gURLs[0].type) {
                case TYPE_REFTEST_NOTEQUAL:
                    result += image comparison (!=) ;
                    break;
                case TYPE_REFTEST_EQUAL:
                    result += image comparison (==) ;
                    break;
            }
            gDumpLog(result + \n);

            if (!test_passed && expected == EXPECTED_PASS ||
                test_passed && expected == EXPECTED_FAIL) {
                if (!equal) {
                    gDumpLog(REFTEST   IMAGE 1 (TEST):  + gCanvas1.toDataURL() + \n);
                    gDumpLog(REFTEST   IMAGE 2 (REFERENCE):  + gCanvas2.toDataURL() + \n);
                    gDumpLog(REFTEST number of differing pixels:  + differences + \n);
                } else {
                    gDumpLog(REFTEST   IMAGE:  + gCanvas1.toDataURL() + \n);
                }
            }

            if (!test_passed && expected == EXPECTED_PASS) {
                FlushTestLog();
            }

The error message includes image comparison (==) so we know the harness thought |gURLs[0].type == TYPE_REFTEST_EQUAL|.  The error message also includes a single image IMAGE: ... so we know the harness thought |!!equal|.  Working backwards we have to assume that it deduced |test_passed == true| from the first line of code.  This means the harness must have thought |expected == EXPECTED_FAIL|.  For that to be true it must have found a |fails| condition on the line in the manifest.

CORE-633177,2011-02-10,JavaScript Engine,CORE,initprop/initelem sharp variables and duplicated property names,"The bug #522158 removed CheckRedeclaration checks from the interpreter cases for JSOP_INITPROP and JSOP_INITELEM. The assumption was that the compiler should check for the duplicated property names so the bytecodes would always add unique properties to the object.

But this assumption is wrong in presence of sharp variables. They leak the partially initialized object so a script could add a property to the object that matches not yet executed name or index of JSOP_INITPROP and JSOP_INITELEM like in the following:

function f() {
    return #1={1:(#1#[1] = 2 #1#)};
}

On the surface the bug is very mild as CheckRedeclaration only warns without throwing error (unless throw on warning mode is enabled) in such cases. So one way to fix this bug is to acknowledge the regression and add the comments to refer to this corner cases with sharp variables.

On the other hand our defineProperty implementation that iniprop/initelem call currently does not check for all the restrictions stated ES5 8.12.9 [[DefineOwnProperty]]. In particular it can change some attributes of non-configurable properties. To prevent this we can change the implementation to set the property not define it if it exists.

Yet another possibility would be to fix defineProperty to implement all the restrictions from DefineOwnProperty. But that is not easy see bug 624364 for reasons.",general,igor,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-01-26,0,3,2012-01-26,350,normal,2

TAMARIN_GRAVEYARD-634651,2011-02-16,Garbage Collection (mmGC),TAMARIN_GRAVEYARD,Need API to distinguish roots from stacks,"Currently the GCRoot API is used for at least two things:

- garbage collection roots ie objects that are roots for GC and for which
  write barriers are not required for assignment.  These need to be scanned 
  at the beginning and end of a GC cycle: at the beginning to get the collection
  going at the end for correctness.

- stack-like memory -- AS1 stack AVM+ alloca system ie objects that are
  roots for the GC in a sense and which do not require write barriers but
  which need be scanned only at the end of the GC cycle for correctness.

Currently we are allowing GC roots to be split by the marker to limit the height of the mark stack but that is mainly to accomodate the stack use cases; normal GC root objects are quite small and should generally not be numerous and need not be split for incrementality nor for keeping the mark stack small.  The stack use case will need to split the objects but those split objects will never be deleted while marking is ongoing (stack marking is atomic) so the splitting protocol we're currently using for roots and which is complicated would not need to be used.",lhansen,lhansen,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-02-01,0,8,2011-02-22,6,normal,2

Every time while asking questions on yahoo answers the browser hangs permanently when the categorize your question page loads. This happens EVERY TIME in the same fashion and the browser has to be killed by the task manager manually.

This doesn't happen with Google Chrome.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ask a question on yahoo answers by filling in the question and the detail in the first step.
2.Proceed to the next step where you are required to categorize your question.

3.Bam! You want to kill yourself because it has hanged yet again.
Actual Results:  
The Browser hangs and stays that way no matter how much you wait. In other words needs to be killed manually by task manager.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't have hanged.

NSS-64132,2001-01-02,Libraries,NSS,NSS performance measurement,"NSS libraries are said to perform poorly in highly multi-threaded environments. 
The belief was that NSS's performance problems were lock contention problems as 
well as CPU usage. The performance measurement tools I am familiar with focused 
their attention on CPU performance. There appeared to be no tools that would 
identify and measure lock contention.

The approach to measuring the lock contention is to instrument all lock usage in 
NSS libraries. NSS uses NSPR's lock primitives: PRLock PRMonitor PRCondVar. 
The goal is to minimize or eliminate entirely any effects of the 
instrumentation when measurements are not being done. When measurements are 
being done the goal is to minimize the effects of the instrumetation.

The method is to replace all locking calls in NSS with calls to some wrapper 
fucntion that provides the instrumentation. Calls to PR_Lock() become calls 
to PZ_Lock(). The calls to the wrapper function are conditionally compiled away 
when instrumentation is not desired (the default method of compilation). When 
instrumented builds are desired make the NSS libraries using gmake 
OS_CFLAGS+=-DNEED_NSS_ILOCK.

Two new files are added to provide the wrapper functions: 
mozilla/security/nss/lib/util/nssilock.h nssilock.c.
A unit test program is provided in mozilla/security/nss/cmd/ilock/ilock.c
A data formatting program discussed later is provided in 
mozilla/security/nss/cmd/ttformat/ttformat.c

Calls to the wrapper functions may record data about the function being called 
the caller times ... yadda. The recording is done to an in-memory array of 
fixed size binary data structures.

The mechanism to drive the performance tests is to use the existing test 
programs: mozilla/security/nss/cmd/selfserv/selfserv.c and 
...nss/cmd/strsclnt/strsclnt.c. Both these programs were tweaked to increase the 
number of threads used make the number of threads used a command line option 
(-t n) and to ensure that all the desired threads were created. Instrumentation 
was added to selfserv.c

The data accumulated in the in-memory table are written when the table fills 
and/or when the stop command is received by selfserv. In practice the table 
was set larger than would be used in the test runs making the stop command 
necessary to flush the table.

Tests were performed on a Dell Precision 220 (2x 600MHz PIII processors 512MB 
RAM...). Client and server side were run on the same machine.

The raw binary data was formatted using the ttformat.c program. This used 
printf() to make it human and perl friendly. The formatted data were processed 
using a couple of perl scripts. The results show potential bottlenecks.",larryh,larryh,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-01-24,0,12,2001-01-24,22,normal,2

NSS-64706,2001-01-08,Libraries,NSS,occasional failures of RSA_NewKey,"mpp_make_prime takes an mp_int named start which it uses as the starting 
point to search for a prime.  (Note that this is one of the rare cases where 
an input variable is NOT const.  mpp_make_prime modifies it as it goes along
and if mpp_make_prime succeeds in finding a prime it uses start to return
the value.)  mpp_make_prime searches the space [start..start+64k] for a 
prime.  If it does not find a prime in that space it returns MP_NO 
and that should be treated like SEC_ERROR_NEED_RANDOM; that is it should 
cause another attempt to generate that prime.

In RSA_NewKey the calls to mpp_make_prime are wrapped with CHECK_MPI_OK().
This jumps to cleanup if the function returns anything but MP_OKAY.
If/when mpp_make_prime returns MP_NO the caller should generate a new 
random value for start and try again.  

I'd suggest this code be structured so that if you've gotten one prime
and the attempt to get the other prime fails (that is you've got p
and mpp_make_prime returns MP_NO for q) that you regenerate only q and
not p.

Also It would be a good idea I think to put some kind of counter in 
RSA_NewKey to limit the number of times that it tries to find a prime 
or to generate a key pair from the primes.  

When mpp_make_prime returns MP_NO it means that mpp_make_prime could not
find any prime in the 64k number space.  That may be legitimate (i.e.
it may indeed be that there are no primes in a particular 64k space) or
it may be that mpp_make_prime is broken and is failing to find primes 
when primes actually do exist.  If mpp_make_prime returns MP_NO we want
to retry the operation (that is create a new random start value and call
mpp_make_prime again) some number of times but not inifinitely.  That way
if a bug arises that causes mpp_make_prime to always return MP_NO 
RSA_NewKey won't become an infinite loop.",bugz,nelson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-01-24,0,6,2001-01-24,16,normal,2

TOOLKIT-650649,2011-04-17,Safe Browsing,TOOLKIT,url-classifier bloat (memory use grows slowly even in new profile idle browser showing blank tab),"On two different Windows 7 machines I observe a slow but continuous memory leak when the browser is completely idle and showing a blank tab. This happens even in a completely fresh profile. Specific steps to reproduce:

* Create a new profile.
* In the new profile enter add-on manager and disable all plugins and system-provided add-ons (one of these computers has several such the other only has Flash and Acrobat).
* Optionally install dbaron's leak monitor add-on [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leak-monitor/] in the new profile.

* Restart Firefox.
* Open a new (blank) tab; close the about:home tab.
* Open Task Manager and select the process list.  At this point firefox.exe should be using about 38MB of RAM.

* Leave the computer untouched for at least an hour.  When you return firefox.exe will be reported as consuming close to 60MB of RAM.  If you continue the experiment the Firefox process continues to grow at a rate of approximately 20MB per hour.

The person who regularly uses these computers informs me that the leak is much worse if the browser is actually used for anything with Firefox growing to consume all available RAM within a few hours; and that reloading a single page repeatedly seems to be especially bad. Some of that may be extensions' or pages' fault of course.

Over on Mac and Linux I don't observe the same problem (but I haven't yet tried exactly the above experiment) so it could well be a Windows-specific issue.  I'm filing this under Tabbed Browser because dbaron's leak monitor fingered browser.js for at least some of the leaks (details to follow).",gpascutto,zackw,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-05-27,6,62,2012-03-13,331,normal,2

CLOUD_SERVICES-652175,2011-04-22,Server: Core,CLOUD_SERVICES,Incorporate a user into the python auth flow,"The current python implementation doesn't keep any concept of user state - information about the user in the request - other than what it gets from auth headers. This has been fine up to now but with the removal of a dn that can be derived from the userid there's some inefficiency since most LDAP requests will now be 2 requests - look up the dn then take some action.

Some future possibilities may also make this more complicated. It's possible that we'll want to store some connection information internally. For example we might adopt a convention for weave nodes such as phx.services.mozilla.com:weave45 where the first part is exposed to the user as their entry point but we do a bunch of configuration and lookup from the second part.

The PHP version had no issues with this. Because the auth piece was user-centric and instantiated on each call it was in effect a user object. Python goes to an initialize-once model for auth which is where the mismatch occurs.

There are a couple possibilities to address this:

1) The simple solution is to start using a dn instead of an integer in the user_id parameter for the LDAP class. This has some advantages - it means that we don't have to alter any of the other auth classes to accommodate LDAP. Since we don't expose the uidnumber externally it should require minimal code changes. The downside to this approach is that storing more complex information about a user becomes more difficult. Getting additional config information into sync is hard for example. However since that's 'future' this approach may be best for now

2) Instead of passing around a username or id as needed we can start passing around a user dictionary or object. As it interacts with the auth system more details can be filled in as needed. So for example get_email_address would be something like:

function get_email_address(user):
    if user.get(email None):
       return user.get(email)

    get the email out of ldap using the dn in the user object
    user[email] = email
    return user.email

as long as the controller keeps the user object around this should do everything we need. The downside is of course that it's a lot more complicated - the whole auth interface needs to be reworked and all the corresponding libraries redone.",telliott,telliott,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-06-23,0,14,2011-06-20,59,normal,2
CORE-65219,2001-01-12,String,CORE,Do something about nsStringRecycler and nsCStringRecycler,"We need to do something about nsStringRecycler -- right now there are a
handful of users recycling their strings into it but nobody is using it
to create strings so it's just becoming a sort of a leak I think. In
other words a few (very few) string users call nsString::Recycle and
nsCString::Recycle and nobody calls nsString::CreateString or
nsCString::CreateString.   Note that this has nothing to do with the more
commonly used but deprecated |Recycle| function defined in nsStr.h.

It also uses static constructors that (now that I added nsDeque to the
leak stats) show up on the leak stats.

Unless somebody thinks this we should all start using the string recycler
(and hook it up as a memory pressure observer) I propose that we get rid
of it.  It seems that it may well become somewhat obsolete with scc's
forthcoming string changes anyway.  Any thoughts?

Add/Release calls. So everything compiles and links just fine but the app will 
give stack imbalance errors when run. In the user app the calls to Add/Release
() have been compiled as __thiscall instead of __stdcall since XP_WIN was not 
defined.

This is very difficult to find since all of the souce code looks correct when 
viewed in the debugger. Only after looking at the disassembled code could I see 
the missing push of the this pointer and finally figure out what happened.",dveditz,jonsmirl,fixed,1,resolved,4,2003-08-01,0,18,2003-07-31,925,normal,2

That means there is no central process responsible for populating these tables.  The crons TCBS TCBU and DailyUrl all use the IdCache class so potentially all can be doing inserts into the 'osdims' and 'productdims' tables.

I suggest that we consolidate this into one location so that we have a saner one writer many reader module.  That one location ought to be the processor.  It examines every processed crash so it has the opportunity to keep the 'osdims' and 'productdims' tables up to date with the stream of incoming crashes. 

I also suggest that the reports table be given extra fields for 'productdims_id' and 'osdims_id'.  This would simplify the new TCBS and TCBU crons as they would no longer be responsible for normalizing os versions.

I'm considering having the processor also do the 'urldims' table because parallelism is attractive.  However that task depends on the fate of TCBU",nobody,lars,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-03-04,0,5,2014-03-04,1007,normal,2

TOOLKIT-673383,2011-07-22,Startup and Profile System,TOOLKIT,Output stdout in regular command line on Windows,"Currently we can build command line application using Firefox or Xulrunner through a XUL application with an application.ini and an XPCOM to catch command line arguments.
But this approach has multiple issues:
 - you can't control stdin
 - it is not a real command line application on window due to the temporary stdout windows displayed when you pass `-console` argument
(stdout is not displayed in you command line terminal)
 - you have a profile that gives a heavyweight process.

So we may be able to build something looking like a command line application but xpcshell is an obvious way to build a real one.

My first idea was to ship xpcshell binary with Firefox but ted suggested a better option:
Adding a `-shell /path/to/js/file` option in Firefox that executes the given script as an xpcshell script. It is close to the `-app` option but running only a script instead of a full XUL application.

I'm currently working on providing a command line tool for Jetpack using Jetpack itself. So that the only dependency of jetpack to develop an addon is Firefox and one Addon.
I already have built a command line application that may replace our python tool called `cfx`. My issue is that it only works with XPCshell on Windows due to the lack of real STDOUT for xul application.

Problems document URL above. One bug has been filed on each recommendation 
for deciding whether we do it and if not whether we should. ]

3.1 Save resources retrieved from the Web on the local system using the
appropriate system naming conventions.

     The media type of a resource retrieved by HTTP [RFC2616] is determined
     by the content type and encoding returned by the server in the
     response headers.

     If the user wants to save a resource locally the user agent should
     respect the system naming conventions for files (e.g. PNG images
     usually have a .png extension).

     Example:

     http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/html40.ps is a view of
     the gzip'ed PostScript version of the HTML 4.01 specification. The
     HTTP headers sent by the server include:

     Content-Type: application/postscript; qs=0.001
     Content-Encoding: gzip

     If saved locally the filename on most computers should be
     html40.ps.gz for the applications to recognize the file type.

Of course we should be able to drilldown into per-tab usage (via ?verbose or interactive clicking).  The first level of subdivision could partition globals by bfcache entry.  This would help to avoid the current confusion the bfcache causes in about:memory (bug 685758).  Below that we could partition globals by the principals->codebase.

For the system compartment there are also >100 globals.  This also coincides nicely with the feature request of reporting per-addon data.

The error it's currently throwing seems to be a problem with logging. I just spent a good amount of time debugging it and I was able to reproduce it on my machine. There's a bug in the suds library when the logging is set to the DEBUG level. Apparently it tries to format an object into a string and there's a bug there.

I can reproduce it locally but strangely the webserver ignores the exception and continues running fine (returning the right 200 result). basket-dev returns a 500 for some reason. I'm suspicious that when we fix this error there will be another one that crops up (the real reason for the 500).

However there are a few places where we need new general content or graphics:

1) Home:
  * New What's New text
  * Updated Download 2.0 graphic
    - Sam mentioned maybe doing this in CSS but 2.0 won't have the needed CSS
      support
  * New images highlighting new features in the rotator?
    - This hasn't particularly been new-feature focused rather more 
      Camino-strong-points so we may not need to do anything)

2) Features
  * Updated Download 2.0 graphic
    - See above
  * Updated feature list/mini-graphics/screenshots
    - The first 4 items were new in 2.0 things last time; we can probably 
      keep several of them by simply updating the text for 
      s/New in Camino 2/Camino/g but we probably ought to have an enhanced
      autocomplete item/graphic in the top row this time around.
  * Web Standards item text needs updating

3) Press
  * This has a bunch of screenshots: http://caminobrowser.org/press/#screenshots
    - The Apple and NYTimes screenshots have dated content but otherwise they 
      really are fine so push-comes-to-shove we don't need to redo them.
    - The Downloads window screenshot must be redone since cpeterso and I 
      fixed the hightlight color mess there for 2.1

Ordinarily Sam handles all of these items but I don't know if he'll be available this time around so I'm hoping to farm out some of these chores. The most critical items are:
* Download 2.0 button (I have what I believe is the source PSD for this and Amasis so in worst-case scenario I can do this on the PowerBook in PS7)
* Downloads window screenshot

CORE-703100,2011-11-16,Layout: Text and Fonts,CORE,remove the existing text-run word cache and replace with a simpler and more efficient scheme,"(Not sure whether to file this under Layout:Text or Graphics; it seems to straddle the boundary...)

The existing textrun word cache implementation has a number of problems:

- Cache entries refer to a range within a textrun which means the glyph data remains owned by a particular textrun and the lifetime of the cache entry is tied to the lifetime of the textrun where the word was first encountered.

- Destroying a textrun requires iterating over its text to find all the words and check whether there are cache entries that refer to them; if so those entries need to be removed. This makes textrun destruction unnecessarily expensive.

- The presence of a single character outside the 8-bit range when a textrun is constructed means that every word in that run will be handled as 16-bit text even if most of them could be handled as 8-bit.

- The same word in an 8-bit and a 16-bit textrun is shaped and cached separately.

- Textruns have to keep a copy of the original text for the cache entries to refer to even though for drawing and measurement all we need is the shaped glyph data.

I'm working on a set of patches to replace this global cache with a scheme where each gfxFont instance will own the text and glyph data of the words that it has shaped so that shaped-word lifetime can be decoupled from the lifetime of the textrun where the word happened to be seen first. This will allow us to manage the expiration of cached words better.

This will also unify the caching of words from 8-bit and 16-bit textruns on a per-word basis so that we aren't forced to cache lots of ASCII-only words in a 16-bit form (in addition to an 8-bit form) just because a single non-ASCII character such as a dash or curly quote happened to occur somewhere in the text.

I believe this will also make it possible to avoid copying the original text into (most) textruns which should be a perf and memory win.

Once the ownership of shaped-word data is moved from textruns to the gfxFont instances it may be possible to change the structure of textruns so that we don't copy glyph data into them at all but instead hold an array of references to shaped words. This could be a further memory win except for extreme edge cases such as a textrun containing a series of single-character words but it is not entirely clear whether it can be done without hurting performance.",jfkthame,jfkthame,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-02-11,0,75,2012-01-06,51,normal,2

CORE-7039,1999-05-25,Layout,CORE,background-position not relative to padding edge when background-repeat is not 'no-repeat' [BG],"Look at the background image evil test:
   http://www.bath.ac.uk/%7Epy8ieh/internet/eviltests/backgroundimage.html

First: for some peculiar reason the background-color is overridden if
background-repeat is anything other than repeat. This is visible in three
out of the four tests in the second section.

Second: the exact vertical position of the background image when the value of
background-repeat means that the image will not be vertically repeated is
wrong by one pixel. (This will probably also be the case for the horizontal
repeat situation but I have not tested it yet.) This is visible in the last
two tests of the second section. (You may need to take a screen shot and examine

NSS-70992,2001-03-05,Libraries,NSS,nss 3.2 will not build on BSD/OS 4.2,"Here's a set of patches that allows the NSS 3.2 release to be compiled
on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

In the current design where transaction objects are created and executed in the low level AUSTable methods this isn't possible. When these were first added they were put there on the assumption that transactions could be used to prevent update collisions. With that not being the case anymore it doesn't make as much sense to keep them there.

Basically doing this would require an AUSTransaction object to be passed to all of the non-readonly methods of Releases Rules Permissions which would pass them along to AUSTable's insert/update/delete. These methods would add statements to the transaction but never call .execute() .commit() or .rollback().

CORE-71275,2001-03-08,Document Navigation,CORE,GtkMozEmbedChrome can hold stale mContentShell reference,"I noticed this problem in SkipStone (see http://www.muhri.net/skipstone/) a
small browser that embeds a gtk_moz_embed window.  When built against my
2001/03/04 pull of SeaMonkey it crashes on startup.  It appears to me to be a
Mozilla bug rather than a SkipStone bug.

The entire problem occurs during execution of GtkMozEmbedPrivate::LoadChrome.

In nsFrameFrame.cpp's nsHTMLFrameInnerFrame::CreateDocShell a newly created
kWebShellCID instance is added to the container tree owner:

        parentTreeOwner->ContentShellAdded(docShellAsItem ...)

where the parentTreeOwner is actually a GtkMozEmbedChrome so it stores a plain
pointer to this docShellAsItem interface in its mContentShell pointer.

Later on the method nsXULDocument::InsertStyleSheetAt calls
PresShell::StyleSheetAdded -> PresShell::ReconstructFrames ->
StyleSetImpl::ReconstructDocElementHierarchy which rebuilds the entire chrome 
tree and this includes freeing the nsHTMLFrameInnerFrame that holds that last
XPCOM reference (in mSubShell) to the webshell destroying it and leaving the
mContentShell pointer dangling.

The crash surfaces a little later usually in
GtkMozEmbedPrivate::OnChromeStateChange when

        treeOwner->GetPrimaryContentShell(getter_AddRefs(contentItem));

causes the reference count of the bogus treeOwner->mContentShell to be increased.

I assume the same problem exists in the Photon embedding code since
PhMozEmbedChrome::ContentShellAdded does the same thing.

I'm not exactly sure who's responsibility this is.  I don't *think* it's a
problem with the particular SkipStone app doing the embedding.  And I'm not sure
whether it's GtkMozEmbedChrome's responsibility to hold a weak reference to the
mContentShell whether content shells should be checking if they are the primary
content of their tree owner and removing themselves if so or what.

This problem does *not* appear under an up-to-date Mozilla 0.8 build only under
SeaMonkey but I haven't been able to figure out what change is responsible.

and Netscape 4.72.

I do see one oddity: Pine displays ^@ (caret at-symbol) at the end of the
message. If I save the message to a file a hex dump shows that the last byte of
the message is 0x00. (Netscape 4.72 displays a round-bracket ')' in its place.)

I do not know exactly how it appears in my Inbox because I don't have direct
access to my mail file. If I did I would've hex-dumped that instead.

Sorry I can't be more exact than that but hopefully this will be 
enough info to help you find the problem.",bugzilla,graham.knap,fixed,1,resolved,4,2009-01-22,0,30,2002-08-12,522,normal,2

CORE-71387,2001-03-08,Document Navigation,CORE,Safe check usage of GetSelectedLocale(),"Hi Jud:

As you might have known that I recently landed a change to separate 
region-specific resources from UI language resources. As a result the 
directory names in bin/defaults/* are also changed. In US build they become
bin/defaults/profile/US/* instead of bin/defaults/profile/en-US/*.

Looking at the usage of GetSelectedLocale() in the following code I believe
that the package name navigator should be changed to global-region.
Otherwise those default files will not be copied as expected.

BUGZILLA-715806,2012-01-05,Email Notifications,BUGZILLA,Emails can get stuck in TheSchwartz's queue because Email::Send::Sendmail doesn't deal with sendmail errors correctly,"Email::Send::Sendmail treats all sendmail errors as transient which results in mail jobs being stuck in the ts_job table.

for example:

| There was an error sending mail from 'bugzilla-daemon@mozilla.org' to 'someone@example..com': error when closing pipe to /usr/lib/sendmail: |

in this case sendmail will have set the exit status to EX_HOST (host name unknown) which should be treated as a fatal error.

unfortunately there's no mechanism to signal to bugzilla that this message failed and it should be removed -- currently all failures are treating as transient and will always result in a retry.  so we'll have to tell bugzilla that the job was successful in order for it to remove it from the queue.  this isn't a massive problem as there isn't anything in bugzilla which alerts admins of these failures anyhow.

Email::Send is deprecated project so we won't be getting a fix into Email::Send::Sendmail.  however it would be pretty simple to write our own sendmail handler for Email::Send which identifies fatal errors from sendmail and returns success.",glob,glob,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-01-27,1,7,2012-01-27,22,normal,2

JavaScript error:

This is from the htmlBindings.xul fil in the keypress handler for the spacebar key.

Info from kin:

A quick look in lxr leads me to believe that your little code snippet assumes
that 'document' is a XUL Document. You guys aren't using XUL in the embedding
world right?

It looks like an nsXULCommandDispatcher is automatically created in the Init()
method of all nsXULDocuments which I believe is what you get when you do a
document.commandDispatcher ...  and nsXULCommandDispatcher defines methods for
getting/setting the focused element (document.commandDispatcher.focusedElement)
which is really a forwarding mechanism to the focus controller that it gets from
the nsPIDOMWindow interface.

exiting the application.  I ran into one problem in NSS that prevents this from 
working.  The function nss_OpenSecModDB keeps a static variable secmodname which 
it uses to determine whether or not the SECMOD libraries have been initialized.  
A call to NSS_Shutdown does not reset that variable to NULL so a later call to 
NSS_InitReadWrite doesn't correctly initialize the SECMOD libraries even though 
the return value is SECSuccess.

I'll be  attaching a patch which is the quick fix for this problem.  It makes 
secmodname a global variable so that NSS_Shutdown can NULL it out and free the 
memory so that the next nss_OpenSecModDB is called the function will go ahead 
and initialize the libraries.

Hi Tara

Per our quick chat here are the details regarding the campaign we'll be sending.

Goal:  Provider subscribers with a gift (persona) for Valentine's Day

- We'll use the Firefox 4 announcement template as a base
- Update header image to reflect a Valentine's Theme 
   - image of firefox costume with heart 
   - highlight the persona somewhere in the campaign 
- Update Facebook / Twitter links 

You can update the original creative.  PSD attached.  Since we are trying to use the same HTML we already have developed please only make changes to:

- the image above the phrase Firefox 4 is here
- removing Firefox button 
- updating buttons to Share with Facebook Friends / Post on Twitter

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37305222/FFx4_Announcement_Email-2.zip

several checkins related to the following bugs:

66213

Anatoliya has worked very hard to do the right thing for editor during 
the implementation of smilies. He is well aware of the review super 
review process tinderbox etc..

I think in Anatoliy's case any interactions with mozilla cvs will be in 
the area of fixing any issues that may come up with smilies. You can 
expect him to show the same due diligence regarding interaction with 
module owners getting reviews and being careful about checking in and 
watching the tree. Like most of our team he won't be spending much time 
at all in mozilla we have plenty enough to do in the commercial tree 
getting our features done and fixing regressions (I wish everyone 
checking into mozilla would have to prove to me that it didn't break 
AIM let me tell ya). Anyway Anatoliy has earned my respect in terms of 
how he generally conducts himself in the tree and I therefore ask for 
your consideration once again at this time.

A few of his sr= came from sfraser one came from kin. It has not been 
generally easy for him to get sr= from outside editor he has only been 
playing in that space. He has been checking into IM and getting regular 
sr= from jelwell and myself for that work.''

InitClassesWithNewWrappedGlobal only uses xpc_CreateMTGlobalObject if !aPrincipal.  On first glance mxr shows all callers passing a non-null aPrincipal.  Try server will tell.

Without xpc_CreateMTGlobalObject we can kill mMTCompartmentMap.

  display: table;
  border-spacing: 2px; 
  border-collapse: separate;

  border-collapse: separate;
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
}

:table {
  display: table;
}

==================================================

...because:

  border-spacing is inherited by default
  border-collapse is inherited by default
  margin-top has '0' as the initial value anyway
  margin-bottom has '0' as the initial value anyway

I'm not sure about the -moz-box-sizing declaration will :table ever be given
an explicit width? If not then the declaration is moot no?

archives and we open 9 or so on startup. Averaging three runs after reboots I 
see about 2.8 seconds spent in BuildFileList(); on a second start it averages 
about .08 seconds on WinNT. On a first load the time is roughly proportional to 
the number of files in the archive not the size of the archive (which makes 
sense we're processing the archive's directory). One exception is en-US.jar 
which seems to take a disproportionate amount of time to load.

The worst thing libjar does is while reading the central directory it PR_Seeks 
back to the local header for each file reads 30 bytes (to figure out the true 
offset of the file data) and then seeks back to the central directory to get 
the next file's data.

Instead we should 1) read and process the central directory in big chunks and 
2) leave the file data offset unset until needed. This will eliminate 3 
PR_Reads and 2 PR_Seeks for each archived file -- thousands of OS calls 
eliminated.

SEAMONKEY-72766,2001-03-20,Build Config,SEAMONKEY,Shared libraries must be explicitly linked against libc,"Hi

The current build system does not link shared libraries against libc when
building under Linux. Instead it relies on the other shared objects to pull in
libc.

The problem is that on some architectures functions such as fstat() and
fstat64() are inline functions which are only available in libc_nonshared.a.
Hence in order to be able to get a real function version included it is
necessary to explicitly link against libc which will also include
libc_nonshared.a.

Please change the Makefiles to explicitly link against libc `-lc' when linking
any of the shared libraries.

CORE-728250,2012-02-17,JavaScript Engine,CORE,slimmer and faster JSPrincipals,"With a fresh profile during startup even with optimization from the bug 725576 we still read from the XDR cache about 900 principals. In all cases the principal is the system one yet just to support that we do at least 5 indirect calls and one malloc/free pair per top-level scripts with a storage requirement of at least 20 bytes using a complex interaction between XDR and object input stream.

All this can be avoided if JS_XDRScript avoid any principal transcoding. Rather during decoding the caller should supply the necessary principals to XDR.

While looking at this I noticed that this pattern of too much indirection is rather widespread while working with JSPrincipals.

For example the code assumes that any JSPrincipal that is stored in the script is an instance of nsJSPrincipals that contains a pointer to nsIPrincipal and uses simple static_cast(jsPrincipal)->nsIPrincipalPtr. Yet to do the reverse action of translating the nsIPrincipal pointer into JSPrincipals* we use the virtual call that returns a strong reference to JSPrincipals* that must be dropped. This indirection and JSPRICIPALS_DROP can be avoided if nsJSprincipal simply subclasses both nsIPrincipal and JSPrincipals and any principal implementation then should subclass nsJSprincipal rather than storing its instance in one of its fields. Then one can use static_cast for any nsIPrincipal  JSPrincipal conversion.

Another unnecessary indirection is the implementation of JSSecurityCallbacks::findObjectPrincipals. It is defined in nsJSEnvironment which then calls the security manager via a virtual function. This can be avoided if the security manager implements JSSecurityCallbacks::findObjectPrincipals directly.

Yet another inefficiency is the JSPrincipals::codebase string. It is not used in the JS engine. Moreover its uses outside the engine are not on performance-critical paths so the string can be removed completely and reconstructed as necessary from the fields stored in the principals.

It would be nice to address these inefficiencies.",igor,igor,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-03-09,0,32,2012-03-09,21,normal,2

BuildID:    

When browsing an html file that includes charset windows-1255 (hebrew) by using 
mozilla - you need to activate view-character-coding TWICE in-order to receive 
Hebrew display.
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.you need a hebrew enabled windows 98 installed.
2.use notepad to creat an html file. 
3.use the following example:




  logical hebrew



--now press alt+rightShift to switch language to hebrew and type--
  gcrh kudh
--press alt+RightShift again to switch back to English and type-- 
  
  
  
4. save the file as logicheb.html
5. browse the file with mozilla
6. compare the result display with the a display of the same file
   browsed with Internet Explorer.
7. press View on the top bar to open a list box
8. choose character coding from list box 
9. choose Hebrew (windows-1255)
10.compare display with IE's display
11.rpeat steps 7-10
   




Actual Results:  After activating character coding the first time there is no 
change
in display. After repating it will change the display to the one desired for.

Expected Results:  Mozilla should change the display to Hebrew letters after 
first charachter coding. display should natch the one of IE.

sentence is positioned at the correct location. This changes when you finally 
get the hebrew letter. This will be reported in a separate bug report.",nhottanscp,mimi_fruchter,fixed,1,resolved,4,2008-07-31,0,13,2001-05-10,50,normal,2

The only time we should be emailing about RETRY is when someone has explicitly opted in to massive emailing with -e.

Bug 667441 Comment 0 Stuart Morgan 2011-06-27 09:13:34 EDT

Now that we'll be doing security-based plugin blocking (bug 662666) we really need a more reliable way of forcing plugin state updates when Camino is updated. I'll look again to see if I can find a way of poking the plugin system; failing that maybe we'll delete pluginreg.dat on the first quit after each update so the second launch will rebuild (although I'd like to avoid it if we did an autoupdate and deleted it *before* the update already)

Flags: camino2.1+


Bug 667441 Comment 1 Smokey Ardisson 2011-06-27 14:55:12 EDT

One other thought I had: camino.disabled_plugin_names works live; can we use the same mechanism that pref uses to make Core learn about state changes to learn about state changes on launch due to blocklist updates?


Bug 667441 Comment 2 Smokey Ardisson 2011-09-09 23:58:42 EDT

(Somehow this was the only camino2.1+ bug that wasn't also Camino 2.1 milestone.)

Target Milestone: --- → Camino2.1


Bug 667441 Comment 3 Smokey Ardisson 2011-09-17 03:29:51 EDT

I tried to dig around with this again with little luck.  It's easy to find where Firefox pushes state updates to pluginHost (in nsBlocklistService.js via the private copy of |GetPluginBlocklistState| but the magic incantation that makes the new states take effect is still elusive.

To see if it involved a restart I tried using various sample blocklists per the assorted fixed bugs (using extensions.blocklist.url in Fx 3.6 and 3.0 and with a 1s update-check time) to no avail.  The only way I was able to blocklist a plug-in was to edit the on-disk blocklist.xml at which point Firefox noticed on launch (so no restart required).

Er wow; I finally had a network check work; that 1s check interval took about 10 minutes :P  The alert just popped up in front of my Camino window :P  So Fx alerted me QuickTime was blocked (and suggested I restart to completely disable the plug-in).  I declined and opening the Extensions Manager showed it blocked; visiting Apple's trailers page gave me Apple's download QT fallback content (so it's at least showing up as uninstalled to Apple's QT detection routines) but http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000591.htm#4 showed me the blocked for your protection Gecko placeholder.

So there's got to be some way of poking the plug-in system into checking for updated blocked plug-ins (just like camino.disabled_plugin_names disables things live) we're just overlooking it somehow.

Some bugs I looked at: 
* bug 330511 (pluginHost support for blocklisted state)
* bug 391633 (blocklist webservice only)
* bug 271559 (hooked the blocklisting support in pluginHost into the blocklist service)
* bug 419582 (re-enabling an unblocklisted plug-in)
* bug 455906 (severities in blocklist)

I also noticed that pluginHost has some interesting methods Get/SetBlocklisted (which appear never to be called) and UpdatePluginInfo.

Oh from bug 455906 I wondered about this state value that's getting passed around: http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/diff/8291b82dd323/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsBlocklistService.js#l1.489 http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/diff/8291b82dd323/modules/plugin/base/src/nsPluginHostImpl.cpp#l1.61

Any chance that's our magic incantation?


Bug 667441 Comment 4 Stuart Morgan 2011-09-26 00:57:55 EDT

Get/SetBlocklisted should be the backing for setting the disabled property on an nsIPluginTag. We could probably manually re-run our own blocklist but I don't think that really gets us where we really want to be since we'd still have the stale plugin version problem.

I still don't see a good way of forcing the plugin system to reconstruct everything if it doesn't think the plugins on disk have changed :(


Bug 667441 Comment 5 Stuart Morgan 2011-09-26 01:00:43 EDT

Although I guess that would change the bug from not blocking dangerous versions to blocking safe versions (if the plugin system has a stale version); maybe we should combine that with the post-first-launch file nuking so that someone annoyed by an overblock who tried quitting and relauching would get the fix.


Bug 667441 Comment 6 Smokey Ardisson 2011-10-13 02:21:42 EDT

I guess maybe Bug 667441 Comment 4/5 are suggesting what I was thinking tonight after tracing the camino.disabled_plugin_names path.

If we had PreferenceManager call a method |updatePluginBlocklistState| (similar to the existing |updatePluginEnableState|) at launch we could then be able to force an update in PluginHost before Gecko web content encountered a plug-in and decided (not) to ask the blocklist service about the plug-in.  It'd suck to have to duplicate the code in the blocklist service impl (or I guess refactor it) but I think it would get us a better result.

And I'd rather us block safe versions accidentally/temporarily than leave dangerous versions unblocked…


Bug 667441 Comment 7 Smokey Ardisson 2012-02-15 23:24:24 EST

So when writing the patch for bug 727667 it appeared not to be working and I couldn't figure out why (or what was wrong with my code).  Then I remembered this bug.

Since I was testing with a fresh profile I should have had a completely fresh pluginreg.dat getting built and consulting our blocklist but Flash wasn't being blocked.  I launched again with the same profile and still no luck.  I deleted pluginreg.dat and restarted again with the same profile still not blocked.  So I don't think anything related to manipulating pluginreg.dat is going to help since apparently we still aren't being consulted until after Gecko has already decided the plug-in folder/plug-ins haven't changed:

Maybe after getting 2.1.1 out the door I'll have time to do some debugging and see how our camino.disabled_plugin_names makes Core learn about changes and how that differs from the actual blocklisting.

Flags: camino2.1.2?

Since I still have the NSLog in from trying to determine if my code is working I see that we're getting asked about the plug-in each time an instance is started so something is definitely calling our PluginBlocklistService::GetPluginBlocklistState implementation often.

As soon as I add the plug-in name to camino.disabled_plugin_names there's never another call.  There's not a call when I flip the pref (whether there's plug-in content on current pages or not) there's not a call when I load a new page nothing; the plug-in is just disabled.


Bug 667441 Comment 9 Smokey Ardisson 2012-02-16 02:18:03 EST

Created attachment 597699
Partial fix (v0.5)

This sort-of works.

I realized that PreferenceManager's updatePluginEnableState twiddles a bit directly on the pluginTag to turn the plugin off.  Turns out you can also directly twiddle a blocklisted bit too.

If you just twiddle blocklisted the plugin starts to load and then goes away leaving an empty space (the same thing that happens to a running plugin when you add it to camino_disabled_plugin_names); a reload will then show the blocked placeholder.

If you twiddle both blocklisted and disabled bits it (at least on http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/) prevents the start-to-load scenario but you still need a reload load to see the placeholder.  SetBlocklisted is supposed to set the disabled itself though…

The other problem is that once we've set the state we don't get asked again so if the user during the session sets the dangerous plugin pref during the session it won't enable said dangerous plugin.  Maybe we're OK with this since people now (when the blocklist actually works) have to quit and trash pluginreg.dat; otherwise we could probably do the notification dance.

I'm reasonably convinced that Firefox is doing roughly the same thing in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsBlocklistService.js#797-829.

I don't know if we can improve the no notification on first plug-in instance case by having PreferenceManager call GetPluginBlocklistState (or some wrapper or helper) early enough in startup that we have a pluginHost but no pages/pluginInstances (does Gecko read the plug-in state before consulting the blocklist on every load?) or if Gecko would still have to load once to check the flags.  Still this is better than may not ever work situation I'm currently experiencing!

CORE-742174,2012-04-03,Networking: HTTP,CORE,Allow empty Location headers again,"Users are reporting they can get into sites with Chrome that Firefox blocks as Corrupted Content because there is a blank Location header in the response.  I've investigated and indeed Chrome allows a single blank Location header w/o error. (Like Firefox it fails if multiple Location headers with different values are present).

Specifically: 
- For 200 responses Chrome ignores the Location header (whether it's blank or not)
- For 3xx responses Chrome displays the body of the 3xx response if the Location header is blank (or missing)

While Firefox currently fails if Location is empty if we remove that
restriction (i.e. back out 716801) we'll do the following:
- For 200 responses like Chrome ignore the Location header (whether it's blank or not)
- For 3xx responses treat an empty Location as a relative URI and wind up redirecting to the same URI that redirected us. (This is allegedly also IE's behavior: see bug 716801 comment 0).  This was apparently our behavior for many years until 716801 landed (I've verified it in FF 10).  This results in our requesting the same URI again after which we give up (for reasons I haven't managed to figure out yet) without any page navigation showing to the user (i.e. we stay on previous page). Not pretty but we don't need to behave prettily for redirects and it's not IMO a security issue especially since we don't render the 3xx body (which would be under the control of a CRLF attacker). 
- For 3xx with a *missing* Location header we render the 3xx response body.  (that's the case whether we back out or not: just mentioning it FYI).

I propose that we back out 716801 for beta/aurora/nightly and allow empty Location headers again.  This is causing significant web compat hit (apparently including logging into servers using PeopleSoft: see bug 699502 comment 10).  I'm not convinced that there's actually a good case why empty Location headers are actually a special case that deserves banning.  In particular bug
716801 comment 8 claims that empty Location deserves special treatment since an empty Location will result in the (CLRF attacker's) response body being rendered.  But as shown above that's not actually true for us for 3xx responses and it's not worse than any other CLRF injection in the 200 case.

One last wrinkle: since 716801 landed we also added additional tracking of certain empty headers in bug 704227.  In my backout I'm going to add Location to the list of tracked headers which will mean that responses that include

  Location:
  Location: http://...

will fail.  This logic is also in aurora but not beta so beta won't fail this case.  But I don't think it's a significant one.  (For a reference point the ESR branch declined to take the patch for 716801 in the first place). FWIW all branches will fail the opposite case where the empty Location comes 2nd.",jduell.mcbugs,jduell.mcbugs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2012-06-04,0,30,2012-04-10,7,normal,2

so that users know which apps are eating their data plans.

This is actually considerably trickier than bug 746069 in general.  (I think.)  We care about this most for b2g initially and b2g will be multi-process.  That's nice because in that setup all network traffic will go through a choke point at the PNecko interfaces.  And further each PNecko can find an associated PBrowser pretty easily which is bound to a domain / app-manifest for the installed web-app case.  From there we just have to meter the usage and store it in a DB somewhere.  We also need the PNecko things to known which network interface they're talking through.  We might be able to re-use some existing web-app DB adding some new columns.  Not sure.

AFAIK this would be considerably harder for the same-process case.  So we might want to punt the general case initially.  (Necko folks might have better suggestions.)

After that we have to expose API to read the usage data.  I don't have a strong opinion on how to do that.",johnshih.bugs,cjones.bugs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-02-18,0,118,2013-11-01,564,normal,2

1. We need a simple heuristic to decide when to throw away code. A really simple one to start with is the GC reason. If it's gcreason::ALLOC_TRIGGER or gcreason::MAYBEGC then we'll keep the code. Otherwise we'll throw it away. Eventually we can do something fancier but not in this bug.

2. We need to not throw the code away. Hopefully this is a simple matter of commenting out a few lines.

3. IonMonkey needs to reset all ICs whenever a GC happens. This is because shapes can get moved around or reallocated.

Build ID: 20120515042006

Steps to reproduce:

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:14.0) Gecko/20120516 Thunderbird/14.0a2

I noticed that Mail Account Setup wizard cannot detect service running on port 465 with SSL/TLS.  I found the problem with version 12.0.1 (for Windows and Mac).  I tried Earlybird (14.0a2) for Windows but it was still broken.

I did the following steps:
(Assume an (internal) SMTP server running services on standard port 25/465/587)

* Select Account Settings -> Account Actions -> Add Mail Account
* Enter a name and Email address and click Continue
* Thunderbird found configuration by trying common server names
* Click Manual config and change outgoing SSL setting from STARTTLS to SSL/TLS
  (The port number was automatically changed from 587 to 465)
* Click Re-test


Actual results:

Thunderbird reported Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account.

If I reverted outgoing SSL setting to STARTTLS and clicked Re-test Thunderbird reported The following settings were found by probing the given server.

I'm sure that the server is configured correctly because I could manually edit Outgoing Server (SMTP) in Account Settings to use SSL/TLS for Connection security and send messages without problems.


Expected results:

Thunderbird should be able to find service on port 465 with SSL/TLS by probing the given server. Actually version 9.0.1 worked as expected so it is a regression.

I captured packets between the client and server using wireshark and noticed that Thunderbird didn't send SSL client hello to port 465 after 3-way handshake and just closed the connection.  imaps (993) and pop3s (995) are detected properly. I guess something is wrong with the service detection logic.",irving,ykasap+mozilla,fixed,1,resolved,4,2017-10-18,0,24,2012-08-23,99,major,4
CORE-75623,2001-04-11,Document Navigation,CORE,OnStartDocumentLoad() can be called >1 time,"nsDocLoader::OnStartRequest() has logic that seems to be incorrect.
Specifically I'm seeing OnStartDocumentLoad() called on a document more than
one time. What appears to be happening is that...

1. The main document's load group has no more URLs but for some reason still
   considers itself to be busy. (My test case has three IFRAMEs; maybe it
   has something to do with that.)

2. The scrollbars on one of the IFRAMEs gets painted. This kicks off an image
   load to get the scrollbar's background image.

3. The load group's active count goes from zero to one.

This screws up the layout regression tests and maybe other stuff. I think the
fix is simple; specifically be sure to check that the load flags are set such
that this is a nsIRequest::LOAD_DOCUMENT_URI.",adamlock,waterson,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-04-12,0,9,2001-04-12,1,normal,2

• one of the most common ways our users are compromised is an attack against an out of date plugin.  For the last year we've had an awesome website that has a great user experience to help users keep their plugins up to date (http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/) 

• Our biggest challenge is to get more users to that page so they can upgrade their plugins. This is of particular concern since nearly 20% of internet users have a seriously old version of flash that puts them at immediate risk for compromise.

CORE-76198,2001-04-16,XPCOM,CORE,Threadpool optimistically kills worker threads,"SUMMARY

The threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number 
of threads is greater than the minimun limit.  

The file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads.  During startup 
there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity.  For every file that 
is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool.  The file 
transport sets min and max number for the number of threads.  The current logic 
in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the 
limit. When the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any 
pending requests.  If there are none and there are more threads in the 
threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits.  

Because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool.  The file 
transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant 
threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are 
primarly needed for startup.

Another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any 
additional request that may come in.  

For example:

From a normal startup to ftp://ftp.netscape.com.org there are 73 new threads 
created and 72 threads deleted.  (This is completely insane) After putting a 5 
second wait there are only 13 new threads created and 12 deleted.  This removes 
60 thread creation/deletions.  

Going to http://www.mozilla.org creates 49 threads.  Adding a 5 second delay 
reduces this to creating only 6 threads.

Clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so 
that we don't get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start.

I am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time.  I ran some basic 
timing tests.  On a P3 dual 500 (windows 2k 128mb ram) it take only 2ms to 
create 10 threads. However this is not a accurate picture since creation of a 
thread doesn't really do much but schedules it.  I also looked at how long it 
takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running.  The data indicates 
that it takes longer as there are more threads.  With 3 threads present it 
takes on average 200 milliseconds from the time PR_CreateThread() is called to

Haven't checked linux or mac yet.

Overview: This bug summarizes the changes that should be made to the Stand Alone 
window (double click onto a message in the thread pane) menu items. It includes 
mnemonic and accelerator issues as well.

1. Add
a. Menu Item:
- File|Print Plus (also needs l for mnemonic)
- File|New|Message (also needs M for mnemonic Ctrl+M)
- File|New|Address Book Card (also needs C for mnemonic)
- Search  (Bugscape# 4617 Netscape only)

b. Mnemonics
- File| Attachments need A
- File|Get New Message for  from f to w

c. Accelerator
- File|New|Blank Page to Edit needs Ctrl+Shift+N
- Message|Mark|All Read (bug# 66681 from A to Ctrl+Shift+C now tbd)

2. Delete
a. Edit|Edit Draft (for normal messages. It should also not be present for draft 
messages because opening a draft message automatically places it in edit mode)
b. View|Message
c. View|Sort by
d. View|Messages

CORE-763842,2012-06-12,DOM: Workers,CORE,Uninitialised value use in dosprintf(SprintfStateStr* char const* std::__va_list),"DOM: Other is probably the wrong component; not sure of a better one tho.

Whilst starting B2G on GalaxyS2 I saw the complaint below plus some
probable duplicates.

From a few minutes peering at the code what might have happened is:
(w/ some guessing so don't take this as certain)

WorkerPrivate::DoRunLoop(JSContext*) at WorkerPrivate.cpp:2668 does

  mMemoryReporter = new WorkerMemoryReporter(this);

The constructor called is inlined at this point hence the origin of
the uninitialised value is listed here.  Looking at the constructor's
code WorkerMemoryReporter(WorkerPrivate*) starting around line 153
there is (lines 168/169)

      uint32_t addressSize =
        JS_snprintf(address sizeof(address) 0x%llx aWorkerPrivate);

and I think that leads to the dosprintf call that is complained about.
In particular it's complaining about a 64 bit comparison against zero
(jsprf.cpp:276) in cvt_ll

... int64_t num ...
    while (num != 0) {

The JS_snprintf line above looks suspicious to me.  It takes
aWorkerPrivate (a pointer type hence 4 bytes on ARM) and asks it to
be printed with a %llx (64-bit) format.  I'd guess that the complaints
arises because that arg is passed on the stack without first being
widened to 64 bits hence JS_sprintf hauls 64 bits out of memory half
of which are garbage and attempts to print it.

Uninitialised data from the same source is also reported to surface at
a second place LimitStuff(SprintfStateStr* char const* unsigned
int) which reduces the likelyhood that this is a false positive from
Valgrind.

By shutting and reopening the sidebar to force a refresh this is often but not
always capable of being worked around.  Sometimes it gets completely wedged and

CORE-775243,2012-07-18,General,CORE,Create top-level directory for Python modules,"Created attachment 643529
Is this OK?

I'm requesting that a new top-level directory be created in mozilla-central with the intention of holding all of the MPL-compatible Python packages and modules in the tree. What this is called is undecided. I'll throw out python and pylib.

I initially tried to do this starting in bug 754469 comment #5 but it flew under the radar. I figured I'd file a new bug to track just this issue.

The context here is that currently we have a lot of Python support code scattered throughout the tree. The intention with creating a new top-level directory is to eventually unify all this code to one central easy-to-find location. This will increase discovery and should hopefully lead to less duplication and better cohesion. It may even lead to higher quality since the increased visibility through unification may result in more consistency between in-tree code making it easier to read and debug.

I think we need a top-level directory because the Python in the tree is cross-module. We have bits for interacting with the build system running tests support tools etc. I don't think there is a better place to put it.

How bad is it currently? Just do a `find . -name '*.py'`. The following directories (and more) all need to be searched for Python modules at any given time:

* build
* build/pylib
* build/pymake
* config
* dom
* editor/libeditor/html/tests/browserscope/lib/richtext2
* ipc/ipdl
* modules/freetype2/src/tools
* testing/marionette
* testing/mochitest
* testing/mozbase/* (8 directories)
* testing/peptest
* testing/...
* xpcom

I verified that getComputedStyle().getPropertyValue() only retrieves the weight
value that is internally stored. In my opinion it is *not* DOM's job to modify
this value because the internal equivalent for normal is 400.

CORE-78019,2001-04-28,ImageLib,CORE,Some images loaded from server but they should be in cache,"Overview Description: 
 Running a simplified version of i-bench on a second (and subsequent)
 load of the documents with a caching policy of 'Once per session' 
 I still see the following images being fetched again.

 Edited HTTP server log (Apache):

 23:30:52  GET /zdnet2/loadspeed/allimages/50.gif HTTP/1.1 200 3720
 23:31:15  GET /zdnet2/loadspeed/allimages/3.gif HTTP/1.1 200 3181

 23:31:56  GET /zdnet2/loadspeed/allimages/2.gif HTTP/1.1 200 3653

Steps to Reproduce: 

1) Go to http://jrgm/zdnet2 with a new/emptied cache and run the app.

2) do 'tail -f /etc/httpd/logs/access_log |grep /zdnet2/' to see what 
   is requested and you will see those images being loaded on each 
   cycle.

Actual Results: images that should be in the cache are reloaded

Expected Results: shouldn't need to reload these images given the 
                  situation.

Reproducibility: 100%

Additional Information: 

I looked for a simpler way to reproduce this or a reason why those images
need to be reloaded but could find neither.

These image URLs are all loaded by more than one document in the test.  I set
up some cache headers for html documents in another directory so I could get
the document URL's to show up along with the image URL's (i.e. which document
is wrongly loading which image file). This is that list:

Refactor user service interaction v1

Attached patch passes all unit tests \o/

I didn't bother writing new unit tests for userservice.js because this service is going away with Sync 2.0 and it has test coverage through service.js and the various test_service_* tests. I also didn't convert cluster.js:_findCluster to the new API because it was beyond my pain threshold for a Friday afternoon.

You may ask why I wrote userservice.js if it is going away. Well I've had the file around in a branch for months. I actually get to use the code yay!

CORE-78390,2001-05-01,Plug-ins,CORE,Active Accessibility: support not working with Acrobat plugin,"From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (Windows NT 5.0; U)
BuildID:    

We understand that important feature that is being worked on
in mozilla is the accessibility of the browser for those with
disabilities especially those who are visually impaired.

One main feature of our latest release of Adobe Acrobat
is accessibility.  A lot of work was done for Acrobat
5 was to make it accessible including inside the browser.
Frankly the only game in town at that time in terms
of browser accessibility was Internet Explorer so that
is where we focused our development efforts.  

Now that the mozilla team is looking at mozilla accessibility
we would like to work with you to ensure that Acrobat is
accessible in mozilla.  

The contact person in Acrobat
Engineering is Loretta Guarino Reid lguarino@adobe.com


See http://access.adobe.com for more details on the Acrobat
accessibility efforts.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start any screen reading program on Windows 2000 e.g. JAWS. 
2.Install Adobe Acrobat 5 and mozilla.
3.Drop the nppdf32.dll plug-in from the Acrobat install directory
into the mozilla plug-ins directory.
4.Browse to any PDF file on the web e.g. 
http://access.adobe.com/browser/cookbook.pdf
5.Attempt to read the PDF document using the screen reader.

Then compare what happens when you use IE to browse to the same
document (you don't have to move a plug-in to IE). 

Actual Results:  The screen reader is unable to read the Acrobat PDF document. 

Expected Results:  The screen reader can read the Acrobat PDF document.

The attached (hacky! demo!) patch introduces the notion of a capturing TabParent.  During a [ touchstart ... touchend ] series the TabParent consumes all the events and we completely bypass DOM dispatch.  This patch has a number of problems so don't take it too seriously.

CORE-79334,2001-05-08,CSS Parsing and Computation,CORE,Possible speed up of style data sharing,"[Assigning to marc since pierre is away]

The current model of style data sharing that pierre implemented is limited
along descendants i.e. a child style data can only inherit in the line of its
ancestors. Despite this apparent limited scope of sharing the observed savings
have proved to be substantial and pierre noted in bug 43457 that a further area
of investigation could be to see if more savings can be achieved by allowing
style data sharing on the overall style tree.

There is however an element in pierre's current implementation that is worthy
of consideration at this stage: looking at the code of the present model by
convention the inheritance is encoded by setting the child style data pointer
to null. So whenever a style data pointer is null it means that there is an
inheritance (or sharing) from the ancestor context for which the style data
pointer is non null. This means that to recover the actual values (during style
resolution or layout/paint) one has to grovel the style tree using the walking
function FetchInheritedStyle() and I wonder if that function isn't showing up
high in the perf radar? There are thousands of style data and frames/reflows
and everytime you do GetStyleData(color | display | etc.) up you go grovelling
the style tree to fetch the values.

A possible alternative could be to alter the convention so that: 'sharing means
my data pointer is identical to my parent.' This way the fetching functions
could become O(1).",attinasi,rbs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2001-07-18,0,8,2001-07-18,71,normal,2

Checking the file reveals that lines 31 and 51 are the only (non-comment) lines
on which it appears.

It appears that it is simply not counting the first two sets of comments in this
case but I've also found cases where the line number listed is actually -after-
the line number on which the identifier appears which means it's somehow
counting non-existant lines somewhere along the way.  I've poked around the

I propose we add new methods to provider objects:

* isUrlInOrigin(url allowLocalUrls):

  Checks if a URL is the same origin as the provider or is allowLocalUrls is set a data: or similar URL which is valid for use by a provider.  This would use  nsIScriptSecurityManager.checkSameOriginURI() for the origin check and nsINetUtil's URIChainHasFlags() method to check for local urls.

Not specifically mentioned in that bug but related:

* isValidProviderUrl(url):

  Checks if a URL is valid for use by a provider.  This will *not* perform the same origin checks but encapsulates the code at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-social.js?mark=484487#484

* resolveUrl():

  Resolves a potentially relative URL to the providers origin.  Does not fail if already an absolute URL in a different origin.

The behaviour is pretty simple. If I type into a text or memo field in a

typing this report in Notepad so I can do just that) the characters

[ by itself doesn't appear

It seems isolated to punctuation; I haven't seen any problems with letters and
numbers and some punctuation seems unaffected (e.g. $ !)

This is either just a problem with displaying and form submissions themselves
are unaffected or this is actually changing what can be typed into the 
text field itself; either way there is a bug to report. This paragraph is
being typed directly into the browser so as a test here is the full set

Build ID: 20121119042013

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to use this script in Nightly with Scriptish: http://ms11.github.com/4chanSoundPlayer/

On 4chan there are threads called sound threads where you post images with sounds embedded in them. In the post body there are words in [brackets]. Clicking on the words in brackets plays the embedded sounds.

The latest known working Nightly build is 2012-11-08. I last tested on 2012-11-20. Aurora has not yet been updated to 19 but since it was broken in Nightly 19 I suspect it might break in Aurora as well.


Actual results:

Instead of the sounds playing I get this error in the web console: TypeError: window.URL.createObjectURL is not a function. I had the script log values and at the runtime of the script window.URL is defined but window.URL.createObjectURL has a value of undefined.

If I check the values on the web console by hand window.URL and window.URL.createObjectURL are both defined.



Expected results:

The sound should have played.

CORE-81640,2001-05-18,Networking: Cache,CORE,Lower threshold for large cache entry eviction,"Mozilla should have a user configurable limit on the maximum size of an
object that can be permanently cached. Retrieving a really large object
forces other objects out of the cache which may not be reasonable
particularly for users on a slow link. For example I often visit sites
which have the same image in various sizes. There is a small browse
version and a hi-res version. You view the browse version and download
the hi-res version if it's interesting. The hi-res version is often a
4MB jpeg or even a 40MB tiff and it is _not_ meant for viewing in a
browser. It is irritating to see mozilla flush almost everything else in 
its cache just to accommodate these beasts.

For symmetry there probably should also be a minimum size limit. I can 
imagine a user on a fast network retrieving small objects from a proxy 
server or something without storing them in mozilla's disk cache.

If it were me I would set a maximum size of 4MB and a minimum size of 0.

Just some ideas.",byronm,tenthumbs,fixed,1,resolved,4,2011-07-26,3,47,2010-09-07,3399,normal,2

test case showing issue

A HTML table is rotated through 'transform: rotate(22deg)'. A script then
applies the inline style 'transform: none' flushes the layout changes
and removes the inline style. See attached test case.

Steps to reproduce
  1. load attached test case
  2. click on first link inline 'transform: none' is applied
  3. click on second link the above is removed

Expected result: table is rotated 22 degrees.
Actual result  : table is rotated 44 degrees...

I often use the phone booths on the third floor for vidyo calls.  I've used both my laptop and also the tablet in the room. In both cases I see poor vidyo performance nearly every time I use the room. This is not a constant poor performance but instead the vidyo will freeze every 5 or 10 minutes or completely drop.

My laptop is connected to Mozilla AP BSSID ...64:08

I ran a continued ping to google.com from my laptop when using the tablet and confirmed the poor performance coincided with the dropped pings.

Expected:

Music should eventually start playing from the phone.

Actual:

Music fails to start. This works fine on FF Android with the FF Android user agent and FF OS user agent so it's definitely not a user agent issue.

Result: The text is pasted backwards.
Note: If I write atleast one Hebrew character in that box and THEN paste the
direction is correct.

Problem 2:
1. Type SHALOM hello into the input box (with SHALOM being a Hebrew word).
Note: At this point I expect the cursor to be in the end of the string.
2. Press Ctrl+U (traditionally erase to beginning of line on Unix widgets)
Result: Nothing is erased.

2. Press END (to certainly go to the end of line).

Currently our JSON parser does not take advantage of this and calls the generic define path for every encountered property.  This define path is slow and requires lots of roots which will get slower with exact marking.

It would be better if the parser waited until it collected all the properties for an object then used a cache to quickly compute its final shape going the define route if the properties are new.  Allocating the object last also means that the object can be sized to the number of properties it will have improving memory utilization / performance.

Similarly if arrays are not allocated until all their elements have been parsed then they can be sized to their number of elements.

TI already has a cache for giving initializer objects types according to their properties.  This can be adapted to be used by JSON and as an added bonus means that the JSON objects will have accurate type information fixing a long standing performance issue (we currently don't use TI at all with objects that were produced by JSON.parse).

SEAMONKEY-838,1998-09-18,Build Config,SEAMONKEY,Mozilla fails to build correctly on any non-gcc/g++ HP-UX compiler,"Well I'm back again with my exploits on HP-UX 10.20 and the by-now-surely-
infamous 4th September 1998 Mozilla build - here's a progress report:

* HP's cfront-based C++ (CC command) just can't build 4th Sept 98 Mozilla
  at all (bombs out early during the compile and many fixes later convinced
  me to give up). All previous Mozilla releases built fine with CC so there's
  a lot of g++-isms been added with the 4th Sept release I suspect.

* HP's ANSI C++ (aCC command) can actually build Mozilla but it core dumps
  during intiialisation. I didn't really fancy debugging this so I concentrated
  on installing the latest gcc/libstdc++ and using that to build Mozilla
  instead.

* gcc 2.8.1/libstdc++ 2.8.1.1 both builds Mozilla and manages to run Mozilla
  on HP-UX 10.20 but there's serious problems with background tiling - loads
  of graphical corruption on any pages with background tiles.

So the advice is to stick with gcc/g++ for building Mozilla on HP-UX - all
other compilers don't work. Even gcc/g++ produces that background tile problem
though. Has anyone at Netscape actually managed to build the 4th Sept 98
Mozilla at all and get it to work sensibly ?

BTW there's a major omission in the build config for Mozilla - a mid-way
build - i.e. one without optimisation *or* debugging. I ended up having to
hack around in 3 or 4 places to get rid of the -O's (whilst keeping BUILD_OPT
defined). I did this to rule out optimisation bugs in gcc/g++ (I ruled them out:
same problem with a non-optimised build).",briano,rkl,fixed,1,closed,6,2004-11-22,0,7,1999-03-11,174,critical,5

Andreas found that one of our devices was more sensitive than others and had to modify this function for MWC with a patch like this:

 
   function onTouchEnd(deltaX evt) {
     var page = currentPage;
-    /* Bigger than panning threshold or fast gesture */
-    if (Math.abs(deltaX) > panningThreshold ||
-        touchEndTimestamp - touchStartTimestamp < kPageTransitionDuration) {

+        (Math.abs(deltaX) > panningThreshold &&
+        touchEndTimestamp - touchStartTimestamp < kPageTransitionDuration)) {

This is a followup bug to land some similar change on the master branch and make the page switching decision velocity sensitive so that we look at the motion plus the motion that would accrue based on velocity and if the total is more than half the screen width we switch pages.

CORE-845873,2013-02-27,JavaScript Engine,CORE,IonMonkey: Baseline: Fix Octane-gameboy out-of-bounds typed array writes,"The Octane-gameboy benchmark in GameBoyCore.prototype.dispatchDraw has the following loop:

  for (var canvasIndex = 0; canvasIndex < canvasRGBALength; ++canvasIndex) {
      canvasData[canvasIndex++] = frameBuffer[bufferIndex++];
      canvasData[canvasIndex++] = frameBuffer[bufferIndex++];
      canvasData[canvasIndex++] = frameBuffer[bufferIndex++];
  }

Problem is that canvasRGBALength is 92160 and canvasData.length is only 23040 so most of the writes are out-of-bounds... IonMonkey just hoists the bounds check and keeps bailing out we don't currently have a way to detect out-of-bounds typed array SETELEM's.

Numbers with parallel compilation (inbound is JM+Ion baseline is BL+Ion):

- inbound: 14111
- baseline: 12438

If I change the loop to iterate from 0 to canvasData.length:

- inbound: 15312
- baseline: 17341

So it looks like this is the main problem BL has with this benchmark and fixing it can be a nice win on this benchmark.

What we should do is the following:

(1) Baseline: Add a bit to SetElem_TypedArray's key to indicate we've seen out-of-bounds writes. The IC stub can then just ignore these writes (see obj_setElement in jstypedarray.cpp).

(2) Have Ion query the baseline IC and add an MStoreTypedArrayHole instruction similar to MStoreElementHole so that it doesn't bail out.",kvijayan,jdemooij,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-05-09,0,17,2013-03-07,8,normal,2

Change ContentParent::GetNewOrUsed to return an already_AddRefed value.

At present ContentParent::GetNewOrUsed uses an nsRefPtr to hold the freshly constructed ContentParent and then returns it via a raw pointer so that the reference gets dropped. If the call to ContentParent::Init weren't registering the new instance in a dozen different places (mostly observers which arguably shouldn't count as strong references) the ContentParent would get deleted when GetNewOrUsed's nsRefPtr went out of scope.

The attached patch is meant to change GetNewOrUsed to follow the standard pattern here: use nsRefPtr::forget to produce an already_AddRefed value to return thus retaining the reference count and using the type checker to ensure that the callers are prepared for what they're getting.

Sadly the callers are all doing something weird with the value. But at least the weird code looks weird now.",jimb,jimb,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-04-03,0,9,2013-04-03,30,normal,2

Improved handling when getenv(XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG) returns NULL.

In COMM-CENTRAL
there is a test test-plugin-crashing.js

I am not sure if the behavior somehow changed in the last week or so.
This now forces a crash of a program by referencing a null pointer.
(The test has been around for some time. I see the name of the test from the logs I keep since early January.)

But just before the crash now I see a strange line. (This has been
observed since I refreshed the source about a week ago.)

The line looks like this:

XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG: (null)

XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG: (null)

COMMENT: Please note the strange XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG: (null) line before the crash of plugin-container.

After browsing the source I found that there is now a function
|NoteIntentionalCrash(const char* processType)| in
mozilla/xpcom/glue/IntentionalCrash.h that seems to use an
environmental variable XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG to create an external log
file to print out a message that a process with a printed PID will
crash intentionally.

However if the environment variable XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG is not set
it prints out the terse cryptic line as described above.

I am attaching a patch that solves a few issues.
 - It will not crash HERE by trying to print the string value using
   %s when getenv(XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG) returns NULL.
   I believe this code will crash on say Solaris.
   That GNU LIBC printf and its friends print (null) for 
   format specifier %s and the passed NULL pointer value is
   a nicety and not guaranteed to run at all everywhere.

 - Also since it is not entirely clear what the output means
   when XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG is not set I made the code to
   print something more meaningful (well at least to me.)

After the patch the session log looks like this:

New session log:
   [...]
WARNING: NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv rv) failed with result 0x80070057: file /COMM-CENTRAL/comm-central/mozilla/extensions/permissions/nsContentBlocker.cpp line 212
For application/x-test found plugin libnptest.so
XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG is not set.
Purposeful crash of process 2063 is not recorded.

Program /COMM-CENTRAL/objdir-tb3/mozilla/dist/bin/plugin-container (pid = 2063) received signal 11.
Stack:
   [stack dump follows.]

I have no idea why XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG is used for the
plug-in crash testing purposes in TB but that is another matter.

CORE-8581,1999-06-21,Layout,CORE,missing GetIID() methods on interfaces,"missing GetIID() methods causes unpredictable bugs when using interfaces and
nsCOMPtr.

From Bruce Mitchener Jr.'s original note on the layout newsgroup:

Hello.

I've been going through the tree and making sure that interface classes
have |GetIID()| implementations as nsCOMPtr requires.

A number of files in mozilla/layout are missing their |GetIID()|
implementations.  Which of these shouldn't have them for some reason or
other?  The only valid case that I can see is nsIFrame which isn't
reference counted and so you wouldn't want an nsCOMPtr.

layout/base/public:
nsIDocumentContainer
nsIDocumentObserver
nsIDocumentViewer (has nsCOMPtr usage)
nsIFrame
nsIFrameImageLoader
nsIFrameReflow
nsIFrameUtil
nsILayoutDebugger
nsINameSpace (has nsCOMPtr usage)
nsINameSpaceManager (has nsCOMPtr usage)
nsIPageSequenceFrame
nsIReflowCommand (has nsCOMPtr usage)
nsISpaceManager
nsIStyleFrameConstruction
nsIStyleSheetLinkingElement

layout/events/public:
nsIEventStateManager (has nsCOMPtr usage)

layout/html/content/public:
nsIFocusableContent
nsIForm
nsISelectElement

layout/html/forms/public:
nsIComboboxControlFrame
nsIFormControlFrame
nsIFormManager
nsIListControlFrame

layout/html/style/public:
nsICSSParser (has nsCOMPtr usage)

layout/xml/document/public:
nsIXMLContentSink
nsIXMLDocument (has nsCOMPtr usage)


I can add the |GetIID()| implementations to all of these if they should
all get them.  Please advise.

Thanks!

NSS-869080,2013-05-06,Libraries,NSS,ssl3_HandleHandshakeMessage should also increment ssl3.hs.recvMessageSeq if ssl3_Handle returns SECWouldBlock,"Created attachment 745957
Patch

(I originally reported this problem in bug 867795 comment 1 and bug 867795
comment 2.)

At the end of ssl3_HandleHandshakeMessage() we have a big switch statement
to call the ssl3_Handle function to handle the foo_bar handshake
message and then increment ssl3.hs.recvMessageSeq:

    switch (ss->ssl3.hs.msg_type) {
    ...
    case :
        rv = ssl3_Handle(ss b length);
        break;
    ...
    default:
        (void)SSL3_SendAlert(ss alert_fatal unexpected_message);
        PORT_SetError(SSL_ERROR_RX_UNKNOWN_HANDSHAKE);
        rv = SECFailure;
    }

    if (IS_DTLS(ss) && (rv == SECSuccess)) {
        /* Increment the expected sequence number */
        ss->ssl3.hs.recvMessageSeq++;
    }

    return rv;

At least one ssl3_Handle function ssl3_HandleCertificateRequest
may return SECWouldBlock.  (In that case SECWouldBlock means the user
callback function ss->getClientAuthData() returned SECWouldBlock.)  I
think ssl3_HandleHandshakeMessage() should still increment
ss->ssl3.hs.recvMessageSeq in that case.

Note: I don't know if an ssl3_Handle function will return SECWouldBlock
in any other circumstances. Perhaps ssl3_Finished? Brian is perhaps the best
person to answer this question.",wtc,wtc,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-05-19,0,5,2013-05-07,1,normal,2

INFRASTRUCTURE_&_OPERATIONS-872363,2013-05-14,WebOps: Other,INFRASTRUCTURE_&_OPERATIONS,Create new ElasticSearch cluster for public bugs,"metrics has an ES cluster that contains not only the current state of Bugzilla but past history as well.  ElasticSearch provides a better method of performing certain types of analyses and use of it doesn't impact the main Bugzilla database.  However it contains *some* information on confidential bugs so it is behind LDAP which means that any tools that use it generally must be behind LDAP as well which limits their usefulness.

It would thus be really great to have a publicly accessible ES cluster which contains *only* data on public bugs (or to word it another way *no* data on confidential bugs of any type).

mcoates has already signed off on this idea from a security standpoint provided that bugs with any limitations on visibility are excluded and that all data conerning bugs that are made confidential some time after creation (i.e. were at one point public but no longer) is removed in a timely fashion.

To do this we'll need to

1. Find some hardware.  I am not sure what capacity we'll need.
2. Set up an ES cluster.
3. Create a script/app to sync data from the Bugzilla db.  Hopefully we can adapt whatever metrics uses bearing in mind that it has to grab only public bugs and remove information on bugs that are later switched to confidential.

I'm sure I'm missing some details but that's the gist.

What kind of timeline can we expect for steps 1 and 2?  Let me know if you need me to figure out hardware requirements.",dmaher,mcote,fixed,1,resolved,4,2013-11-25,0,23,2013-06-05,22,normal,2

CORE-887420,2013-06-26,JavaScript Engine,CORE,js::ClearStructuredClone can free any address,"ClearStructuredClone looks like it just scans the entire buffer looking for 8-byte chunks that start with SCTAG_TRANSFER_MAP and then reads the next 8 bytes as a pointer and passes that to js_free.

This is bad because strings are written directly to the buffer; that is the user controls bytes in the middle of the buffer.

On little-endian platforms something like this could trigger a bad free:

    var buf = new Int8Array(8).buffer;
    postMessage(
        {s: \u0123\u4567\u000f\uffff\ucdef\u89ab\u4567\u0123 b: buf}
        *
        [buf]);

It doesn't seem to happen on my machine but probably for superficial reasons.

The shell is unfortunately immune because it doesn't support transferables yet and even with sfink's patch Add an optional parameter to the shell serialize() function for specifying Transferables in bug 861925 it never calls ClearStructuredClone so the buffer is simply leaked and the bug can't be triggered. In a locally hacked build I added the call from Serialize() to JS_ClearStructuredClone() and ran this:

    var buf = new Int8Array(8).buffer;
    serialize(
        {s: \u0123\u4567\u000f\uffff\ucdef\u89ab\u4567\u0123 b: buf}
        [buf]);

which caused this output:

 neil@parkwaycc.co.uk 2013-07-05 15:56:55 CEST

So this function (mailnews/base/prefs/content/AccountManager.js::setFormElementValue) makes very little sense unfortunately it was written like this in 1999 and just monkeypatched every time.

* The defaultValue and defaultChecked properties have never existed.
  (The author may have been thinking of HTML input elements.)
* null compares == to undefined so there is no point comparing twice.
* Nobody passes undefined these days anyway.
* The function gets called for some radio buttons even though it also gets
  called for the radiogroup that chooses the value. The code here fortuitously
  avoids changing the radio's value in this case.

So I would really appreciate it if someone was to clean the code up.",acelists,acelists,fixed,1,resolved,4,2016-08-02,0,4,2016-08-02,1124,normal,2

HU team chooses to localize the web/video content of masterfirefoxos.com.  This means the localization tasks (excluding video/audio recording/mixing tasks) includes the following and may not be limited to:
- localization of the web content - see the attached file - about 4000+ words
- localization of the video audio script - ~ 700 words  
- review and correction of website once the content is being staged
- screening voice talent (if you don't want to do it let me know) prior to recording
- review of audio tracks with localized script
- review of mixing of video clips with localized audio
- review of the final website for your language and final signoff prior to product launch.

Timeline:
- there are lots of post production work involved after the initial translation
- each assembly and staging of content involves review and verification some tasks have dependencies of another.
- web content localization is due on August 31
- video audio script is due on August 31
- other milestones yet to be mapped out
- site will be ready by end of Sept or early October.",kelemeng,pmo,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-01-29,0,35,2014-01-29,164,normal,2

NSPR-9155,1999-07-01,NSPR,NSPR,Sun Workshop 5.0 C++ compiler cannot compile prstrms.cpp.,"The C++ compiler in Sun Workshop 5.0 uses the
standard iostreams as default.  Standard
iostreams are template-based and are very
different from the classic iostreams in
Workshop 4.2.

mozilla/nsprpub/lib/prstreams uses classic
iostreams so Workshop 5.0 can't compile it.
We have two options:
1. Port lib/prstreams to the standard
   iostreams.
2. Add -library=iostreams on the command line
   to compile code using classic iostreams.

Option 1 is probably the right thing but
it appears to be a lot of work.  Since
lib/prstreams is not used by most NSPR
clients I decided to take the easier
option 2.

Since GNU make's 'shell' function reads the
*stdout* of the command I need to redirect
the stderr of the command to its stdout.

That prevents using commands that require modules from under python/ to be used as native commands which is a bummer.

Unfortunately all these arrays are added to yet another array so avoiding the object allocation completely is not trivial without an analysis that would be pretty complicated (and feels like cheating although the benchmark is so stupid it probably deserves it).

We could follow V8 and add COW ObjectElements: we still have to allocate the objects but the ObjectElements will only be allocated/cloned once they are modified.

It's a fair amount of work: we need a new bytecode op for array initializers with constant elements ObjectElements will have to be refcounted the VM and JITs have to clone when writing to COW ObjectElements etc.

OTOH it's an optimization that could help other benchmarks as well for instance SS date-format-tofte has similar array literals.

Also this test is very important for our total Peacekeeper score: if we could run this test as fast as V8 it'd win ~500 points ~25% of the difference with Chrome.",bhackett1024,jdemooij,fixed,1,resolved,4,2017-05-22,4,15,2014-08-20,289,normal,2

- Fence object need to be delivered to TextureClient even when ImageClientSingle::FlushAllImages() is called.
- When TextureClient is rendered to multiple targets ImageClientSingle::FlushAllImages() should affect to the TextureClient but not to other CompositableClient.

In rebasing patches to v1.3 (not v1.3t) two things found and I think they're worthy of a simple follow-up.

First we use `this.context.ICCContactHelper` in ICCContactHelper member functions like addICCContact readSupportedPBRFields readPhonebookField and updateSupportedPBRFields.  That should be replaced by this pointer.

Second for branches without bug 958773 uplifted xpcshell reports failure running test_ril_worker_icc.js because this time RILQUIRKS_V5_LEGACY equals to true while one case in that test script has this.context.RIL.v5Legacy equals to false.  This is only reproducible when rebasing patches in bug 960894 to v1.3 branch.  However it's not logically perfect in m-c so here comes this bug.

Mozharness picks up on the SyntaxError line and treats it as an error even though the message is prefixed with Warning:. It would be helpful if it was treated as a warning instead.

Does it make sense to only match at the start of a line? Or as aki suggested in irc:

FTE.zip

Description:
If the user selects a language other than English during the FTE such as Magyar the keyboard will not show up in the FTE when entering WIFI information etc. The language will load if the user goes to Settings->Languages and picks another language accepts then selects the original language again.

Repro Steps:
1) Update a Buri to BuildID: 20140417000204
2) During the FTE pick a language other than English (Magyar)
3) Proceed through the FTE until reaching the Wifi settings.
4) Select a network and attempt to enter the Wifi password.

Actual:
The keyboard will not appear. It will remain in unusable until re-selected from Settings->Languages

Expected:
Keyboards from languages other than English load properly and are usable in the FTE and afterwards.

MAILNEWS_CORE-999524,2014-04-22,Build Config,MAILNEWS_CORE,client.py should default to https urls,"Created attachment 8410367
The fix

From looking at the release building and what's client.py doing I noticed that we're defaulting to http rather than https.

As a result we've got a slightly different url to what Firefox is using for the repositories i.e. we're using:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

rather than

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

As the url is different the hgtool sees this as a bad url and clobbers the shared repository directory that is used to save builders pulling the whole repo on each build.

There's probably a bug here that hgtool is incorrectly however as releng is generally using https for pulling I think we should be doing the same so I think this change is worth it anyway.

(I realise this may go away soon but in the interim it'll stop costing the builders extra time when they swap from m-c to c-c builds).",standard8,standard8,fixed,1,resolved,4,2014-09-19,0,7,2014-04-22,0,normal,2
